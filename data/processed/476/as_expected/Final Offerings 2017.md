E735,000,000 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024
E340,000,000 5% Senior Notes due 2025

Nidda Healthcare Holding AG, an Aktiengesellschaft organized under the laws of Germany (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Issuer’’), is offering A735,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 3[1]⁄2%
Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’) and Nidda BondCo GmbH, a Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung organized under the laws of Germany (the ‘‘Senior Notes Issuer’’
and together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the ‘‘Issuers’’), is offering A340,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 5% Senior Notes due 2025 (the ‘‘Senior Notes’’ and, together with the
Senior Secured Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’). A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be used together with cash
on hand at the Issuers to refinance amounts that were incurred under the Bridge Facilities (as defined herein) which financed part of the purchase price for the acquisition (the ‘‘Acquisition’’) by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer of the common shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG, an _Aktiengesellschaft organized under the laws of Germany (the ‘‘Target’’), in a voluntary public tender offer_
(freiwilliges Ubernahmeangebot[¨] ) (the ‘‘Takeover Offer’’) and to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Notes, and a portion of the proceeds from the offering
of the Senior Secured Notes will be deposited into a secured account for future utilization, as described in this offering memorandum.

The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum and will mature on September 30, 2024. The Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum and will mature
on September 30, 2025. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, respectively, semi-annually in arrears on
each of March 30 and September 30, commencing on March 30, 2018.

All or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to September 30, 2020, in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the relevant series of Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date and the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as
described in this offering memorandum. Prior to September 30, 2020, and commencing on the Issue Date (as defined herein), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may in each calendar year redeem up
to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any additional Senior Secured Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after
September 30, 2020, in each case, at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum. At any time prior to September 30, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103.50% plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided
that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding after the redemption, with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings.
At any time prior to September 30, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 105.00% plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes remains outstanding after
the redemption, with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings.

All of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the
Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
applicable Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, such Issuer or such third party
will have the right to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of such
Notes. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of Notes of any series may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer, as
applicable, to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes of such series at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with, or upon signing of
a definitive agreement in respect of, such event.

as indirect shareholders of the Target (including with respect to compliance by the Target and its subsidiaries with the covenants under the Indentures (as defined herein)), unless and until the

Collateral (as defined herein). The Senior Secured Post-Control Date Collateral will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a _pari passu basis. See_
‘‘Summary—The Offering—Collateral.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (as defined herein) and the security and the liability of each Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor (as defined herein) and security provider will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances._

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco on a senior subordinated basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on
the earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes and (b) 120 days from the earlier of

_Interests.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances._

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the
Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Union**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive (as defined below), from the requirement to
produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. In relation to each member state (‘‘Member State’’) of the
EEA no offer of Notes to the public in that Member State may be made other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Directive); or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

provided that no such offer of Notes shall require us or any Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make
any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for
us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers
have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary,
other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes
contemplated in this offering memorandum.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an ‘‘offer of Notes to the public’’ in relation to any Notes in
any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on
the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Directive in that Member State. The expression ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’ means
Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, including by Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the Member State.

**Germany**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may not be offered
and sold in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the provisions of the Securities
Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the ‘‘German
Securities Prospectus Act’’), the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 809/2004 of April 29, 2014 as amended,
and any other laws applicable in Germany. This offering memorandum has not been and will not be
submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority (Bundesanstalt f¨ur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (‘‘BaFin’’). BaFin has not obtained and will not
obtain a notification from another competent authority of a Member State, with which a securities
prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Section 17 Para. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act.
The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public offer, public advertisement or in any
similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document relating to the Notes, as well as
information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or used in connection with
any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany. Consequently, in Germany the Notes will
only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any other offering material in relation to the
Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of
Section 2 No. 6 of the German Securities Prospectus Act. Any resale of the Notes in Germany may only be
made in accordance with the German Securities Prospectus Act and other applicable laws.

**Spain**

qualify as a public offer of securities in Spain in accordance with article 35 of the Securities Market
Act 4/2015, of October 23 (Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto
_refundido de la Ley del Mercado de Valores), as amended, and restated from time to time or without_
complying with all legal and regulatory requirements under the Spanish Securities Market Law. None of
the Notes, the Offerings or this offering memorandum and its contents have been approved or registered
with the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (Comisi´on Nacional del Mercado de Valores), and
therefore it is not intended to carry out the public offering or sale of Notes in Spain.

the Euro MTF Market, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other circular, prospectus, form of
application, advertisement or other material may be distributed, or otherwise made available in or from, or

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about market
consolidation and our strategy, investment program, future operations, industry forecasts, expected
acquisitions, transactions and investments (including the Acquisition and the Refinancing), and target
levels of leverage and indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations,
intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about
expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not
statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’
‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘ongoing,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘project,’’ ‘‘seek,’’ ‘‘target’’ or similar
words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but
the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on
potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected
or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those
expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in ‘‘Risk
_Factors.’’ In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements_
contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or
developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from
projected future results include, but are not limited to:

- our highly competitive industry;

- extensive governmental regulation and changes in these regulations, or our failure to comply with
regulations;

- changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory factors which are
beyond our control;

- existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities or
government-sponsored healthcare systems;

- failure to obtain necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products;

- failure to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new Generics products in a timely
manner;

- the risk of litigation and other claims, including with respect to the infringement of third parties
proprietary rights;

- the risk of industrial action or adverse labor relations;

- reputational issues due to product liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived;

- acceptance of the products by end-users and independent third parties, including public health
insurers, doctors and pharmacists;

- problems in manufacturing products;

- potential significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt-on acquisitions;

- disruption of our operations due to accidents, equipment malfunctioning or other unexpected events;

- accidental contamination, non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or
environmental, health and safety litigation or liability;

- our failure to renew agreements with material suppliers and wholesale customers on acceptable terms
or the termination of such agreements;

- changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems leading to delivery bottlenecks or
unintentional increase in inventories;

- significant increases in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our
products or lack of their availability;

vii


-----

- risks associated with cross border sales and purchases;

- risks related to conducting operations in several different countries;

- pricing adjustments of cross-border transactions leading to greater or double taxation of profits;

- risks of international sanctions affecting Russia, in which we operate manufacturing facilities and have
significant sales;

- international sanctions, including economic and trade sanctions imposed by the European Union and
other jurisdictions, affecting our international sales and operations, including in Russia;

- the result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union;

- the potential decline of our sales and profits from generic pharmaceutical products as a result of
competition, both from other pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental
pricing pressure;

- undesirable side effects or other properties of our products that delay or prevent their regulatory
approval or limit their commercial potential;

- counterfeit versions of our products;

- the termination of licenses from third party pharmaceutical companies;

- our inability to retain key personnel;

- a breakdown in our information technology systems;

- our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal data;

- default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of contracting
parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations;

- risks related to potential negative long-term health effects of vaping products use;

- fluctuations in exchange rates;

- transfer price risks;

- impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;

- operating risks, including natural disasters, sabotage, terrorism and other criminal activities;

- the risk of deconsolidation for failure to comply with the requirements set forth in IFRS 10,
particularly with respect to our Vietnamese Joint Venture;

- changes to the composition of the Eurozone; and

- other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors.’’

These risks and others described under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering
memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of
operations and liquidity. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all
such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or
combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering
memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering
memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry. In certain cases, it is difficult in
this sector to obtain precise market, economic and industry information. Certain information used in this

viii


-----

offering memorandum has been obtained from Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc. (‘‘Quintiles IMS’’), a leading
information, services and technology company. In particular, information obtained from Quintiles IMS
includes descriptions of the pharmaceutical markets in certain geographies and details of the Target
Group’s market share and competitive position, which may be based on manufacturer or pharmacy sales
and volume or value. In addition, certain information regarding industry benchmarks and potential cost
savings have been obtained by the Sponsors from a leading global consulting firm.

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers accepts responsibility for the factual
correctness of any such statistics or information obtained from third parties. While the Issuers believe this
information to be reliable, it has not been independently verified, and we do not make any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum.
Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective
of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling
and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what
types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. Additionally, industry
publications and reports from management consultants generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of
such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such
information. We cannot therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we
have not independently verified such information.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

The Target Group owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it uses in
connection with the operation of its business. STADA asserts, to the fullest extent under applicable law, its
rights to its trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of
any other company appearing in this offering memorandum belongs to its holder.

Solely for convenience, the trademarks, trade names and copyrights referred to in this offering

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

Each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer was incorporated in connection with
the Transactions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, each of the Issuers is a holding,
management and finance company with no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and
the Transactions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure—The Issuers are holding
_companies that have no revenue generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the operating_
_companies of the Target Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the Guarantees.’’ As a result, no_
financial information of the Issuers is included in this offering memorandum, except for certain limited ‘‘as
adjusted’’ financial data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the
Transactions.

All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of the Target and its
consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ ‘‘our’’ or the
‘‘Target Group’’ in respect of historical financial information in this offering memorandum are to the
Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

This offering memorandum includes the historical financial statements listed below (together, our
‘‘Financial Statements’’):

- the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Target as of and for each of
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017, which are presented in accordance with IFRS, including
the auditor’s review report thereon (the ‘‘Interim Financial Statements’’); and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for each of the three years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, which are presented in accordance with IFRS and the
supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315(a)(1) of the HGB, including the auditors’ report
thereon (the ‘‘Audited Financial Statements’’).

The financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, is unaudited and has been calculated
by taking the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and adding it to the difference
between the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the six months ended
June 30, 2016. The financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, has not been audited
or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This
information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for such a period or any future
period or any financial position at any past or future date.

This offering memorandum includes certain financial information as of and for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017, presented at the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer, on an
adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom,
including combined financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the Transactions on the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Notes Issuer’s indebtedness as if the Transactions had occurred on
June 30, 2017 and on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Notes Issuer’s interest expense as if
the Transactions had occurred on July 1, 2016. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what
the Issuers’ indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on June 30,
2017, or July 1, 2016, respectively; nor does it purport to project the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the
Senior Notes Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The pro forma financial
information as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, has not been prepared in accordance
with IFRS. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma
financial information as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, have been audited or reviewed
in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

In the future, we will report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations at the level of
each Issuer or, alternatively, German Topco. The fiscal year of each Issuer ends on December 31 of each
calendar year and we expect that the first annual consolidated financial statements for the Issuers will be
available in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS. Under IFRS 3
‘‘Business Combinations,’’ the consideration transferred in an acquisition is measured as the fair value of

xv


-----

the assets transferred by the acquirer on the date of the acquisition, any liabilities incurred by the acquirer
to the former owners of the target and any equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value
of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs
are expensed as incurred, except for deferred costs related to the acquisition of debt or equity securities.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their
fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
amount of non-controlling interests in the target over the identifiable net assets on the acquisition date is
recorded as goodwill. The application of the acquisition method is likely to result in different carrying
values for existing assets and new assets may be added to the target’s balance sheet, which may result in
different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future
financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be
comparable to the Target’s consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum. If the
Offering were registered under the U.S. Securities Act, we would be required to present pro forma
financial statements to reflect such adjustments and the impact of the Transactions, but no pro forma
financial statements are presented in this offering memorandum. We have not identified the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities to be assumed at the date of the Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS, we
have a measurement period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date to finalize the allocation of
the purchase price. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition.’’_

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

**_General_**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of
the financial statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-GAAP financial measures used in this
offering memorandum include EBIT, EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, adjusted sales, constant-currency sales, operating profit, adjusted operating profit, Adjusted
Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Adjusted Capital Expenditures and adjusted net income (our
‘‘Non-GAAP Measures’’). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this
offering memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated Net
Income’’ and ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ presented in the Indentures.

Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows:

- ‘‘Adjusted Capital Expenditures’’ is defined as capital expenditures (as defined below), excluding
payments for significant investments and acquisitions;

- ‘‘Adjusted Free Cash Flow’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), less
Adjusted Capital Expenditures (as defined above);

- ‘‘adjusted operating profit’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, investment income and
result from investments measured at equity, adjusted for certain special items;

- ‘‘adjusted sales’’ is defined as sales, adjusted for currency effects and portfolio changes;

- ‘‘capital expenditures’’ is defined as total capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment and financial assets;

- ‘‘Cash Conversion’’ is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Management Adjusted
EBITDA (as defined below);

- ‘‘constant-currency sales’’ is defined as sales, adjusted so that all of our non-euro denominated sales
are translated into euro at the same constant exchange rate in all periods presented;

- ‘‘EBIT’’ is defined as net income before interest and taxes;

- ‘‘EBITDA’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization;

- ‘‘Management Adjusted EBITDA’’ is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items;

- ‘‘operating profit’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, investment income and result from
investments measured at equity; and

xvi


-----

- ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain
Sponsor-identified adjustments and expected cost savings. These adjustments and cost savings have
been determined solely by the Sponsors as further described in the offering memorandum and should
not be attributed to the Target.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by
factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and
capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBIT, EBITDA, Management Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the
current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. By eliminating certain effects that
affect the comparability between periods, we believe adjusted sales, constant-currency sales, operating
profit and adjusted operating profit enhance investors’ understanding of our underlying operating
performance. We believe a presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, net working
capital, capital expenditures and Adjusted Capital Expenditures is useful to investors to assess our
liquidity. For these reasons, we believe that our Non-GAAP Measures and similar measures are widely
used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS
and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles. Each of our Non-GAAP Measures is defined and
reconciled to its closest comparable IFRS measure under ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial
_and Other Information.’’ Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled_
measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the
limitations of Non-GAAP Measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
income statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on
our financial statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our
performance.

**_Constant-Currency Sales_**

We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of
operations attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into
euro, using average exchange rates as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering
memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under IFRS, but also on a constant-currency basis
using the Non-GAAP Measure titled constant-currency sales. Constant-currency sales removes the
distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro
denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. The
analysis of constant-currency sales was prepared as part of the Issuers’ due diligence of the Target, and the

xvii


-----

Issuers believe that this measure facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of
the Target Group’s operations. Our constant-currency sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014 and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are computed by translating the actual values
of our non-euro denominated sales as per our subsidiaries’ financial statements using the following
adjusted foreign exchange rates instead of the actual foreign exchange rates used for reporting purposes
during the applicable period (except with respect to consolidation adjustments):

(1) Each constant foreign exchange rate presented in this column was used in calculating constant-currency sales. Each rate is equal
to the actual average foreign exchange rate to euro of the corresponding currency during the 90 days ended August 24, 2017.

**_Adjusted Sales_**

We also report the Non-GAAP Measure adjusted sales which is defined as sales, adjusted for currency
effects and portfolio changes. The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact
of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability between periods. In calculating this adjustment
in each period, we use the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative prior period to translate our
non-euro denominated sales in euro. The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like
adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and divestments of companies and products. In
calculating this adjustment in each period, we only take into account the organic sales generated by
products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

In the section entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Results of Operations,’’ we provide a tabular reconciliation for each period between adjusted_
sales and reported sales, its closest comparable IFRS measure. Each such reconciliation table also shows
the comparative data for the previous period. Investors should note that such comparative data is solely
meant to illustrate the comparative basis for the later period and differs from the actual adjusted sales data
for the previous period.

**_Constant Currency Basis_**

In addition, in the section ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Results of Operations,’’ we compare our sales on a constant currency basis. This means that we_
translate our non-euro denominated sales at the same foreign exchange rates as in the previous period to
eliminate the impact of any intervening fluctuations in these rates.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or thousands and percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the
totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. In addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented
in tabular form may differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using the
unrounded financial information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating
to financial and other data set forth in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations’’ are calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements of_
the Target contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the
narrative description thereof.

**STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd.**

In the Target’s balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017, the Target presented certain
assets and liabilities separately as held for sale. As of March 31, 2017, such assets and liabilities related
exclusively to its joint venture STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd. (which is between one of its subsidiaries in
Vietnam, STADA Pharmaceutical (Asia) Ltd., and M.S.T. Commercial and Pharmaceutical Company
Limited) (the ‘‘Vietnamese Joint Venture’’). During the second quarter of 2017, the Target Group’s
management abandoned its intention to sell the Vietnamese Joint Venture and, consequently, it treated
the Vietnamese Joint Venture as a regular subsidiary and presented all its assets and liabilities in its
consolidated balance sheet for the six months ended June 30, 2017. When preparing its Interim Financial
Statements for the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Target was unable to obtain the Vietnamese Joint
Venture’s financial information for the period from April 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, although its
corporate governance rights with respect to the Target had not changed. As a result, the Target has
estimated such information based on the most recent forecasts available to it; such estimated financial
information accounted for 1% of the sales, 2% of the EBITDA and 1% of the net income of the Target
Group in the six months ended June 30, 2017. As of September 2017, the Target Group has resumed
negotiations with a view to a potential sale of the Vietnamese Joint Venture. As a result, the Target Group
expects to revert to presenting the assets and liabilities associated with the Vietnamese Joint Venture as
held for sale in its financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Furthermore, if the Target’s inability to obtain financial information on the Vietnamese Joint Venture were
to continue, this could be regarded as factual evidence of the Target’s loss of control and require the Target
to deconsolidate the Vietnamese Joint Venture in accordance with IFRS 10. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may be exposed to the risk of deconsolidation if we do not comply_
_with the requirements set forth in IFRS 10, particularly with respect to our Vietnamese Joint Venture.’’_

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

We publish our financial statements in euro. The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth below,
the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) expressed as U.S. dollars per
A1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ‘‘best market’’ calculation, in which, at any point in time, the
bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the
lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the
applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The below rates may differ from the actual rates used in
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing in this
offering memorandum. We make no representation that the euro or U.S. dollar amounts referred to in this
offering memorandum have been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted into U.S. dollars
or euro, as the case may be, at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last business day
of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of
the daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the euro on September 21, 2017 was $1.1933 per A1.00.

**Overview**

We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on branded and
unbranded generics, and have a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 18,000
SKUs covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified
product portfolio including many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 125
countries, and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the
MENA region, Asia, South America and Australia.

We are the fourth-largest generics company by sales in Europe as of September 30, 2016. Our marketleading position provides us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered by our scale, brands,
reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and established
distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies. We continually work
to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective manufacturing footprint comprising
19 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building off our tried and tested platform, we have
released on average more than 600 new products per year since 2014. Our solid pipeline of new products
provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth, both
organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our
profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, we
generated sales of A2,248 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of A534 million.

We conduct our operations through two segments: Generics and Branded Products. The graph below sets
forth each segment’s sales by country for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017:

_Generics:_ Through our Generics segment, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost
alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in
our Generics segment require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and
hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with
competition driven by reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expiries of originator drugs
feed our product pipeline in the Generics segment, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and
local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics segment is
diversified, with the top ten products accounting for only 17% of sales in our Generics segment for the year
ended December 31, 2016. The top-five selling products (and their respective therapeutic areas) in our
Generics segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, were: Tilidine Naloxone (pain relief),
Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Pantoprazol (gastric ulcers/reflux), Epoetin zeta (anemia) and Diclofenac (pain

relief/inflammation). The largest countries by sales in our Generics segment for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Russia, France, Serbia and Vietnam. We generated
sales of A1,328 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A286 million in our Generics segment for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

_Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products segment primarily includes branded OTC products, which are
typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests,
cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands
include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-Go (Parkinson’s
disease). The market for products in our Branded Products segment is generally characterized by marketdriven pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty important factors for success.
Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top ten products accounting for only 31% of
sales in our Branded Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016. The top-five selling brands
(and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in
our Branded Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, were: APO-Go (Parkinson’s
disease, prescription required, available in 31 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in
29 countries), Snup (rhinitis, OTC, available in 18 countries), Fultium (vitamin D deficiency, OTC,
available in two countries) and Vitaprost (prostate disease, OTC, available in two countries). The largest
countries by sales in our Branded Products segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, were:
Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Vietnam. We generated sales of A920 million and
Management Adjusted EBITDA of A214 million in our Branded Products segment for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017.

**Our Strengths**

**_Organic Growth Underpinned by Attractive Market Fundamentals_**

Increasing demand for our Generics and Branded Products is driven by global growth factors in the
pharmaceutical industry, including population growth, aging societies, increased incidence of chronic
disease, advances in medical therapies and increasing self-medication and health awareness. According to
Quintiles IMS, the global generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% from 2017 to 2021, driven
by these growth trends and increasing generics penetration. Generics penetration in the market for
prescription products is partly driven by cost-containment regulation that incentivizes the use of generics to
counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs. Another key driver
of generics penetration is patent expiries. According to publicly available estimates, a wave of patent
expiries in developed markets is expected to push originator products with sales of more than $140 billion
in aggregate into the generics market between 2017 and the end of 2020.

Given that our Branded Products segment mostly consists of OTC products, growth in this segment is
additionally driven by factors influencing the self-payment and self-care market for health and well-beingrelated products. We expect demand for self-payment and self-care products to benefit from the ongoing
trend among regulators to transfer prescription drugs to OTC status, which decreases the cost burden on
the public health system and expands the market opportunity for companies offering branded OTC
products such as us. Additionally, demand for OTC products is expected to be driven by rising income
levels and the emerging trend toward greater health awareness, which we believe results from ongoing
research on disease prevention, data access and increasing levels of education. According to Quintiles IMS,
the global OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2017 to 2021.

**_Well-Established Generics Player with Leading Positions in Our Generics Segment and an Attractive Portfolio_**
**_in Our Branded Products Segment_**

We are the fourth-largest generics company by sales in Europe as of September 30, 2016. In our Generics
segment, based on Quintiles IMS data, we hold a top-three market share in generics sales for the year
ended December 31, 2016, in Germany, Russia, Spain and Belgium, and are the fourth-largest player in
Italy. Even though these markets are generally considered mature, there is significant room for increased
penetration and further growth in generics in these markets—for example, according to Quintiles IMS,
generics penetration is below 50% in Italy and Belgium, below 65% in Spain and below 75% in France, and
the generics industry in Germany, Spain and Russia is expected to increase by a CAGR of 5%, 5% and 6%
from 2017 to 2021, respectively. Continued growth in the generics industry in countries where we are
already market-leaders provides us an opportunity to continue to grow sales in our Generics segment.

2


-----

We also benefit from an attractive portfolio of products in our Branded Products segment, including the
category-leading therapies for cough and cold, sun protection, vitamin deficiency and many leading brands
across therapeutic areas in Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and other countries. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, more than two-thirds of sales of our top-30 products in our Branded Products segment
were of products with a top-three market position in their respective countries. Many of these leading
products have been category leaders in their respective markets for many years, providing us with an
opportunity to leverage our local marketing expertise to drive the internationalization of these leading
brands into new markets and further grow sales in our Branded Products segment.

**_Competitive Advantage Through Scale, Local Market Expertise and Established Relationships_**

Our market-leading position provides us with a competitive advantage over any new entrants in our
markets, bolstered by our scale and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market
expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies.

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated
in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly-fragmented, competitors trying to enter a
new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement
regimes and distribution channels. This provides an advantage to existing, large scale players with a long
history of local expertise, such as us. We are highly familiar with the regulatory requirements in our key
markets and have developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory and distribution issues, which
enables us to minimize the time and cost required to obtain regulatory product approvals while maximizing
the number of countries we cover.

Germany, for example, operates a public tender system that covers the majority of prescription generics
sales, which necessitates a modestly sized sales team with significant tender experience. In Russia, on the
other hand, the distribution of prescription generics products is mostly patient-driven after the first
prescription, which significantly increases the need for a larger sales force targeting patients indirectly via
doctors. Our local market experience means that we are adept at navigating these and other regimes and
able to serve each market with a tailored sales and distribution approach. Building on our long history and
our origins as a pharmacy cooperative, we have developed deeply-ingrained relationships with the key
distribution channels in our markets, which we believe are difficult to replicate. Our sales forces are
trained and experienced in identifying the right marketing strategy in each country, and we maintain a
direct sales presence in more than 30 countries, which allows us to stay close to our customers and
distributors and internationalize successful brands.

**_Diversified Across Geographies, Therapeutic Areas, Products and Brands_**

We are diversified across geographic markets, products, therapeutic areas, customers and suppliers. We
market our products in approximately 125 countries with largely uncorrelated end-markets, with our five
largest markets in our Generics segment accounting for 58% of our sales and our five largest markets in
our Branded Products segment accounting for 68% of sales in their respective segments, in each case for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

With more than 18,000 SKUs, we offer a highly-diversified product portfolio and are not dependent on the
success of any single product. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the top ten products by sales in our
Generics segment accounted for only 17% of Generics sales, and the top ten products in the Branded
Products segment accounted for only 31% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering is diversified
across a large number of therapeutic areas and benefits from a high rate of new product launches, with a
strong pipeline for the next four to five years.

The combination of our Generics and Branded Products segments provides us with significant benefits in
terms of diversification and synergies. The pricing of prescription generics is regulated, and volume
demand is relatively independent of economic conditions, such that our Generics business has historically
delivered strong and stable sales and cash generation. Our Branded Products segment, on the other hand,
faces fewer regulatory requirements. OTC products can be brought to the market more quickly, and
pricing is unregulated and driven by competition. As a result, our highly-recognizable brands, customer
loyalty and the lack of competition in certain specialty areas provide for attractive pricing for products in
our Branded Products segment. Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond
relatively quickly to emerging consumer trends. Our presence in both segments allows us to deepen our

-----

local market expertise and regulatory know-how, exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and
marketing and maintain our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.

**_Diversified and Efficient Manufacturing Footprint Across the Globe_**

We have a cost-effective manufacturing footprint that is diversified across 19 manufacturing sites. Our own
production facilities account for approximately 70% of our sales, with the balance being outsourced.
Furthermore, approximately 75% of our in-house production volume is manufactured in lower-cost
countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and
highly flexible production base.

Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, with 14 of our sites being
accredited under stringent EU standards. Moreover, local production helps provide a natural hedge for
currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products
in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our
margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to further streamline and improve
certain aspects of our manufacturing operations.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Cash Flow Generation_**

We have a stable underlying business that has delivered consistent sales growth and resulted in high cash
flow generation in recent years. Our constant-currency sales increased at a CAGR of 4% from
December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2017. We had Cash Conversion of 83%, 74% and 76% for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. While our Management Adjusted EBITDA margins have
been relatively stable (21%, 18%, 19% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016
and the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, respectively), we see significant upside in our ability to drive
cost savings and increase our margins, which we believe can be further improved. Pro forma for the cost
savings we expect to realize by the end of 2018, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, was 23%. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing
liquidity requirements. We have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital
movements, and management has maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a
company focused on generics, we typically incur limited development expenses and no material research
expenses.

**_Highly Committed Sponsors with Key Management Support_**

We intend to draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our
Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive
and successful track record of investing in companies in the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital
increased sales by 49% within two years and significantly increased the workforce at Bio Products
Laboratory, creating a life sciences champion in the United Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large
laboratory diagnostics companies, Synlab (Germany) and Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form
Synlab Group (headquartered in Germany), the new European champion in laboratory diagnostics. In
addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury Pharma and Amdipharm and merged the two businesses to
create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented generics market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy
centered on continued buy and build, further internationalization and applying best practice across both
companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to TSX/Nasdaq-listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion
in 2015. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin,
while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both organically and through targeted
acquisitions.

In addition, the Sponsors have announced their intention to appoint Dr. Claudio Albrecht as new chief
executive officer and Mr. Mark Keatley as new chief financial officer of STADA, following the
reconstitution of the Target’s supervisory board (the ‘‘Supervisory Board’’). Both Dr. Albrecht and
Mr. Keatley have significant experience in the global generics industry, where they have led highly
successful growth strategies at major corporations. Dr. Albrecht was chief executive officer and chairman
of generics company Actavis Group until its sale to Watson in 2012. Under his leadership, Actavis grew its
revenues to more than A2 billion and expanded its international footprint significantly. Previously, he had
been chief executive officer of Ratiopharm Group, having started his career in the generics business of
Sandoz. Mr. Keatley served as chief financial officer of Actavis Group until its sale in 2012. He also has
strong expertise in managing growth and transformation strategies in the generics industry and beyond.

-----

Previously he was chief financial officer of Famar, a European contract manufacturer for the healthcare
industry. He has also worked in medical diagnostic services, investment banking and private equity.
Dr. Albrecht and Mr. Keatley have most recently worked at Albrecht, Prock & Partners, a global strategy
consulting firm with a focus on the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. There, they advised on
multiple major engagements in the generics and broader healthcare sector, including supporting Bain
Capital and Cinven during the due diligence process in connection with the Takeover Offer. Dr. Albrecht is
expected to lead STADA’s transition under its new majority owners in the short-to-medium term and to
assume a non-executive leadership role in due course, once a new CEO has been recruited who will lead
STADA in the long term. See ‘‘—Recent Developments.’’

In the interim, we expect to benefit from the significant industry experience and expertise of our interim
CEO Mr. Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink, a 25-year veteran of the pharmaceutical industry, and our
interim CFO Dr. Bernhard D¨uttmann, previously CFO of two DAX-listed companies, as they guide the
Target together with the Supervisory Board through the current phase of the Target’s transition. Chief
technical operations officer, Dr. Barthold Piening, previously chief operating officer at Acino
International, will also continue in his role on the Target’s executive board (the ‘‘Executive Board’’). The
Target also continues to benefit from its deep bench of operational management, which will continue to
bring to bear its deep local experience with global scale and expertise.

**Our Strategy**

We and the Sponsors have developed the following strategies:

**_Maintain and Grow Market Leading Positions by Leveraging Scale, Highly-Recognizable Brands and Industry_**
**_Growth Factors_**

As an established market leader, we intend to continue to use our scale and highly-recognizable brands to
reinforce and grow our leading market positions in the key countries and categories in which we operate.
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from global growth factors in the pharmaceutical
industry, and as a large player highly diversified across geographies, products and brands and production,
we intend to continue to leverage our scale and broad local expertise to support our base business, improve
our margins and expand our geographic footprints along with the markets in which we operate.

**_Continue to Grow Our Business, Including by Internationalizing Successful Brands in Our Branded Products_**
**_Segment_**

The products in our Generics segment comprise our core business, providing us with a stable sales base
and strong cash generation. We see significant potential to expand sales growth in this segment by
expanding in markets with relatively low penetration rates and supplementing our existing portfolio with
biosimilars, while also benefiting from global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry.

At the same time, we intend to build on our key brands and to grow our Branded Products segment by
strengthening our market shares in our existing geographies and introducing our local category leaders into
new, international markets. Our intention is to continue to gradually increase the percentage of sales and
EBITDA generated by our Branded Products segment. In addition, we plan to continue developing
products for specialty areas, which tend to benefit from attractive pricing, to further expand the scope and
improve the profitability of our Branded Products segment. We also intend to selectively explore
acquisitions that provide attractive opportunities to grow.

**_Increase Profitability by Continuing and Expanding Upon Management’s Strategic Cost Savings Initiatives_**

Our management has devised, and the Sponsors intend to continue and expand upon the implementation
of, certain cost savings initiatives from which we expect to derive significant cost savings and improve our
margins. By the end of the year 2018, we expect run-rate annualized savings of approximately A82 million
per year to arise from these cost savings initiatives. In terms of cost of sales, management has put in place
initiatives to improve direct product procurement by renegotiating supply contracts with our highly
fragmented supply base and to create operational improvements in manufacturing through insourcing
certain third-party manufactured products and streamlining product lines, while also improving our supply
chain setup and organization through hub, route and order size optimization. To achieve these cost savings
we intend to create technology centers of excellence, roll out an operating expense / lean project
management program and reduce our SKU complexity. For general and administrative expenses, we
believe we can achieve cost savings by unifying our IT landscape across our footprint through consolidating

5


-----

IT systems and contracts, reducing non-personnel general and administrative spending and optimizing
advisory and supervisory board costs, while also optimizing our sales force structures by streamlining our
legal entities. We expect to incur A70 million in upfront costs to achieve these cost saving initiatives.

**_Maintain Financial Discipline to Support Deleveraging_**

We intend to maintain a high focus on continuing improvement in cash flows, supported by, among other
things, rapid EBITDA growth resulting from management’s and the Sponsors’ cost savings initiatives on
top of global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry. For our business, which benefits from
significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in
capital expenditures broadly in line with historical capital expenditures. We expect improved cash flows
and discipline in capital expenditures to provide a strong liquidity cushion for our ongoing business needs,
which will be further bolstered by our A400 million Revolving Credit Facility and the long-dated maturity
profile of our other debt. In terms of risk management, we are partly naturally hedged for transaction
currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the same country as the end consumer,
but we also intend to continue to implement exchange rate hedging policies through natural hedge
strategies and derivatives. As a result, we believe that the successful execution of our strategies will allow
us to progressively de-lever and further improve cash flow generation. Notwithstanding our intention to
de-lever and our focus on organic growth, we also intend to selectively consider acquisition opportunities
as and when they arise.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On July 19, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a holding company controlled by Bain Capital and
Cinven, published the terms of a revised, all-cash voluntary public tender offer (freiwilliges
_¨Ubernahmeangebot) (the ‘‘Takeover Offer’’) for all common shares in STADA. Under the terms of the_
Takeover Offer, all shareholders of the Target (the ‘‘STADA shareholders’’) who accepted and tendered
their shares in the Takeover Offer received cash consideration equal to A66.25 per share (the ‘‘Offer
Price’’). At the time the Takeover Offer was announced, the Offer Price implied an equity value of the
Target equal to approximately A4.1 billion, plus the dividend in respect of the 2016 fiscal year, and an
enterprise value equal to approximately A5.3 billion. Following their analysis of the terms of the Takeover
Offer, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the Target declared their support for the Takeover
Offer and entered into an investment agreement, setting forth the principal terms and conditions of the
Acquisition and the Takeover Offer. The Takeover Offer was subject to certain conditions, including
acceptance by the holders of at least 63% of STADA’s issued and outstanding common shares (the
‘‘Minimum Acceptance Threshold’’) by the end of the initial acceptance period, which expired on
August 16, 2017. In accordance with German statutory law, STADA shareholders subsequently had the
opportunity to accept the Takeover Offer within an additional acceptance period, which expired on
September 1, 2017.

When the initial acceptance period expired, holders of approximately 64% of the Target’s issued and
outstanding common shares had accepted the Takeover Offer, and consequently the Minimum Acceptance
Threshold was satisfied. On August 22, 2017 (the ‘‘First Settlement Date’’), the first settlement under the
Takeover Offer occurred, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer acquired approximately 64% of the issued
and outstanding common shares in the Target. On August 25, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
incorporated German Holdco as its wholly owned subsidiary and contributed all of the Target shares held
by it as of this date to German Holdco. On September 1, 2017, the additional acceptance period expired,
with holders of approximately 0.1% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares having tendered
their shares during the additional acceptance period. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer acquired such
additional shares and also contributed them to German Holdco. On or about the First Settlement Date,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco have purchased, and may continue to purchase in the
future, additional Target shares in the open market or otherwise. Any such additional purchases of Target
shares have been, and may be in the future, financed with the proceeds from drawings under the Term
Loan B Facility and, on an interim basis, the Revolving Credit Facility.

STADA’s annual shareholders meeting (the ‘‘AGM’’) was held on August 30, 2017, and approved the
dividend in respect of the 2016 fiscal year. Any STADA shareholder that tendered its shares during the
initial acceptance period did not receive any dividend from the Target in respect of the 2016 fiscal year but
received the full Offer Price in cash from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Any shareholder that tendered
its shares during the additional acceptance period received A0.72 per share by way of a dividend from the
Target and A65.53 per share as residual Offer Price from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

As of June 30, 2017, the Target Group had Existing Debt with a book value of A1,432 million. A portion of
such Existing Debt in a principal amount equal to A1,380 million (and with a book value of A1,376 million
as of June 30, 2017) has become prepayable at the option of the holders and lenders in respect thereof, as
the Acquisition triggered their right to exercise a change of control put right at par within approximately
142 days following the First Settlement Date. The residual amount of Existing Debt with a book value of
A56 million, which does not provide for a change of control put right, is prepayable at STADA’s option. The
aggregate principal amount of Existing Debt that is prepayable at STADA’s option, including both
instruments with and without a change of control put right, is equal to A315 million (and a book value of
A315 million as of June 30, 2017). As a result, subject to the proportion of holders and lenders who exercise
their change of control put right and the amount STADA decides to refinance in its discretion, up to the
entire amount of the Existing Debt (with a book value of A1,432 million and an aggregate principal amount
A1,436 million) may be refinanced in connection with the Transactions. We may determine (or, prior to the
Control Date, the Executive Board may determine) that the Existing Debt at the Target should remain
outstanding and not be refinanced with drawings under the Term Loan B Facility or cash available to the
Target. Prior to the Control Date, any such Existing Debt at the Target that remains outstanding will be
structurally senior to the obligations under the Notes. After the Control Date, any remaining Existing Debt
at the Target may share in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral by operation of the negative pledges in
favor of the lenders under such Existing Debt. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

The funding sources for the Acquisition, the repayment or refinancing of the Existing Debt, and related
fees and expenses consist of proceeds from the following sources:

- equity contributions from Bain Capital and Cinven in the form of equity and quasi equity (including
common and preferred equity instruments and deeply subordinated shareholder loans) totaling an
estimated A2,850 million, the proceeds of which have been or will be contributed to the Senior Notes
Issuer through intermediate holding companies (the ‘‘Equity Contributions’’);

- drawings by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate amount
of up to A1,700 million (equivalent) and the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of up to
A400 million;

- cash and cash equivalents of the Target Group, which, as of June 30, 2017, amounted to A321 million;
and

- drawings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility and the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility which
will be refinanced with the proceeds from the offering of the Notes. See ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisition and to repay or refinance the
Existing Debt are shown in the table below. Both the funding sources described above and the sources and
uses shown below assume that we have acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares in the
Target and that all of the Existing Debt has been refinanced. To the extent that less than 100% of the
shares in the Target are acquired or less than all of the Existing Debt is refinanced in connection with the
Acquisition, the amount drawn under the Term Loan B Facility and the amount of the Equity Contribution
will be reduced proportionately. To the extent that shares in the Target are subsequently purchased in the
open market or otherwise at a price higher than the notional price of A74.40 per share assumed below, the
proportion of indebtedness and equity sources used to fund the purchase of shares will differ from that
presented below. The Term Loan B Facility will be available for drawing from August 17, 2017 to July 10,
2018, and, prior to the end of its availability period, any unutilized amounts thereunder may be drawn into
an escrow account for use after the availability period. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement—Overview and Structure—Availability.’’ Actual_
amounts will vary from the notional amounts presented here depending on several factors, including those
described above and differences from our estimates of fees and expenses.

(1) Represents an estimate of the Equity Contribution required to satisfy the uses based on the assumptions stated below which is
subject to change to the extent such assumptions change. As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Notes Issuer had received
Equity Contributions in the amount of A1,612 million.

(2) The drawings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility and Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility were initially used in connection
with the acquisition of Target shares on the First Settlement Date. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes and the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be used to refinance amounts drawn under the
Senior Secured Bridge Facility and Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, respectively. See ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

(3) Represents the gross proceeds from the Term Loan B Facility, subject to the assumptions stated below. The Term Loan B
Facility will be available for drawing until July 10, 2018, and, prior to the end of its availability period, any unutilized amounts
thereunder may be drawn into an escrow account for use after the availability period. The Term Loan B Facility includes a
euro-denominated tranche in an initial principal amount of A1,400 million, and A300 million (equivalent) as a pounds sterlingdenominated tranche. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement also provides for the Revolving Credit Facility in an
amount of A400 million and an uncommitted incremental facility. Utilizations of the Term Loan B Facility are subject to a
maximum leverage condition. The commitments under the Term Loan B Facility may be cancelled in part to the extent that less
than 100% of the Target shares are acquired or less than 100% of the Existing Debt is refinanced. As of September 22, 2017, the
Term Loan B Facility has been drawn in an amount of A250 million, and the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn in an
amount of A37 million. It is expected that within 35 days of the relevant drawings under the Revolving Credit Facilities,
A23.6 million of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will be refinanced with drawings under the Term Loan B
Facility and A4.4 million of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will be refinanced through a combination of
a drawing under the Term Loan B Facility and additional equity investments. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’_

(4) Represents a portion of the Senior Secured Notes deposited into a secured account for the purposes set forth under
footnote (1) to the table under ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

(5) Represents the Target’s cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2017, and assumes that such cash and cash equivalents will be
available to refinance the Existing Debt.

(6) Represents the aggregate purchase price for STADA’s 62,258,129 issued and outstanding common shares (giving effect to the
84,311 common shares currently being held in treasury) and assuming (i) a purchase price per share equal to the Offer Price in
respect of 64% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares and (ii) for illustrative purposes, a purchase price per
share equal to A74.40 in respect of the balance of issued and outstanding common shares. On September 3, 2017, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer announced that it would propose to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as part of the
negotiations of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (‘‘DPLTA’’) to offer STADA’s minority shareholders cash
compensation of A74.40 per share and to vote in favor of a DPLTA on such terms in any extraordinary general meeting of
STADA. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco also purchased 1.4% of the Target’s issued and outstanding
common shares in the open market as of September 22, 2017, and as of such date Senior Secured Notes Issuer holds directly or
indirectly 65% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares.

(7) Assumes that all of the Existing Debt will be refinanced at par in connection with the Acquisition.

(8) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing, including commitment, underwriting, arranging,
placement, original issue discount, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and
professional fees. These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this offering memorandum and are subject to
change. Refinancing costs exclude accrued but unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities to, but excluding, the Issue Date that will
be paid upon consummation of the Refinancing. Additional expenses in connection with Transactions other than the
Refinancing were paid by the Issuers and the Target and are excluded from this presentation. The Issuers funded such expenses
using proceeds from the Bridge Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equity Contributions.

(9) As of September 22, 2017, an amount equal to A7 million in aggregate was retained by the Issuers in connection with the
Acquisition. A portion of such amount will be used to pay refinancing costs in connection with the Refinancing. See ‘‘—The
_Refinancing.’’_

Prior to the Control Date, German Holdco has influence on the appointment and removal of Supervisory
Board members of the Target through the shareholder meeting. The Supervisory Board has the power to
appoint and remove the members of the Executive Board. Therefore, German Holdco has indirect
influence but will not have direct control over the Executive Board. The Executive Board will be required
prior to the Control Date to manage the Target under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the
best interests of the Target. As a result, pursuant to German statutory law, the majority shareholder may
not exercise its influence to cause the Target to undertake a measure disadvantageous to minority
shareholders unless this is permitted pursuant to German statutory law and compensation is paid to the
minority shareholders by the majority shareholder in accordance with German statutory law. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the_
_Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the Control Date.’’_

On August 24, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer announced that, following the settlement of the
Takeover Offer, it intends to enter into a DPLTA pursuant to Section 291(1) of the German Stock
Corporations Act (Aktiengesetz) between STADA as dominated company and profit transferor and the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or one of its affiliates as dominating company and profit transferee.

Under the DPLTA, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or one of its affiliates would be entitled to:

- instruct the Executive Board even if such instructions are not in the best interest of the Target (for
example, to cause the Target Group to grant upstream guarantees or transfer intellectual property and
to push down indebtedness into the Target Group); and

- receive 100% of the Target’s distributable profits in any year regardless of its shareholding in the
Target, provided that it also balances any annual losses of the Target.

Upon registration of a DPLTA, the dominating company will be required to offer to any minority
shareholders the election to either (i) put their shares in exchange for adequate compensation (the amount
of which is determined in accordance with German law) or (ii) receive a guaranteed annual payment (the
amount of which is determined in accordance with German law) from the dominating company. Both the
amount of the adequate compensation payment and the guaranteed annual payment may be contested by
minority shareholders in appraisal proceedings, though the DPLTA would still take effect regardless of
ongoing appraisal proceedings. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior Secured
_Notes Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the Control_
_Date.’’_

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to de-list the Target shares in the medium-to longterm to the extent permitted by law.

Under German corporate law, implementation of a DPLTA requires approval by a supermajority of 75%
of the share capital represented at the shareholder meeting. As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer holds directly or indirectly through German Holdco 65% of the Target’s issued and
outstanding common shares. On August 31, 2017, Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International L.P.
together with affiliated entities (‘‘Elliott’’) announced that Elliott would only support a DPLTA between
STADA and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries with all of Elliott’s current and
future Target shares if the compensation for minority shareholders pursuant to section 305 para 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) set forth in the published resolution proposal regarding such
agreement amounted to not less than A74.40 per share. See ‘‘Principal Shareholders.’’ There can be no
assurances that a DPLTA will be implemented, either at all or on the terms proposed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—We do not, and may not in the
_future, own all of the outstanding common shares in the Target, and there can be no assurance that a DPLTA_
_will be approved and/or the Target’s shares will be delisted.’’_

**_The Refinancing_**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Issuers entered into the Bridge Facilities Agreements, which
provide for the A485 million Senior Secured Bridge Facility and the A340 million Senior Unsecured Bridge
Facility. The Senior Notes Issuer loaned the proceeds of the Unsecured Bridge Facility to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer through an intercompany loan, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer used the
proceeds from such intercompany loan, the proceeds of the Senior Secured Bridge Facility, the Equity
Contributions from Bain Capital and Cinven and drawings under the Term Loan B Facility, to finance its
acquisition of the STADA shares offered pursuant to the Takeover Offer and to pay certain costs and
expenses in connection therewith.

A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the proceeds from the
offering of the Senior Notes will be used together with cash on hand at the Issuers to refinance amounts
that were incurred under the Bridge Facilities and to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the offering of the Notes, and a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes will be deposited into a secured account for future utilization, as described below.

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from
our estimates of fees and expenses. The presentation of sources and uses below excludes accrued but
unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities to, but excluding, the Issue Date that will be paid upon
consummation of the Refinancing in an amount of A3 million.

(1) Represents a portion of the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes deposited into a segregated bank account held by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, and pledged in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may be
drawn from such account by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer prior to the earlier of August 21, 2020 and the Control Entry Date
(as defined under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions’’) for the same purposes as those permitted for
drawings under, and pro rata for drawings under, the TLB1 and TLB2 (as described under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement—Overview and Structure’’) and, thereafter, for general corporate_
purposes.

(2) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing, including commitment, underwriting, arranging,
placement, original issue discount, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and
professional fees. These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this offering memorandum and are subject to
change. Refinancing costs exclude accrued but unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities to, but excluding, the Issue Date that will
be paid upon consummation of the Refinancing in an amount of A3 million. Additional expenses in connection with
Transactions other than the Refinancing were paid by the Issuers and the Target and are excluded from this presentation. The
Issuers funded such expenses using proceeds from the Bridge Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equity
Contributions.

**Recent Developments**

**_Findings of Report Commissioned by the Target’s Supervisory Board_**

As previously reported in the press, the outgoing Supervisory Board of the Target commissioned a
confidential report by an external law firm to investigate the conduct of certain of the Target’s former
executive officers who are no longer with the Target. The report relates to whether certain immaterial
agreements entered into by the Target during their tenure, and in one case the accounting treatment of
such an agreement, was appropriate and in the best interests of the Target. The report did not find
evidence of self-enrichment, bribery or other criminal activity. While any action taken in respect of the
report remains to be determined by the Target’s Supervisory Board and management, we do not expect the
conduct detailed in the report, the findings of the report or any action taken in respect of the report will
have a material impact on the business, operations, results or prospects of the Target.

**_Supervisory Board_**

On August 25, 2017, STADA announced that in connection with the Acquisition certain members of its
Supervisory Board (including its chairman, Carl Ferdinand Oetker) have resigned from their positions with
effect as of September 25, 2017. In accordance with German corporate law, the successors to the resigning
members will be appointed by court order in the near term.

**_Appointment of Interim CEO and CFO and Sponsor Announcement of Post-Control Date Managers_**

On July 4, 2017, the Supervisory Board announced the appointment of Mr. Engelbert Coster Tjeenk
Willink as interim chief executive officer and Dr. Bernhard D¨uttmann as interim chief financial officer,
following the resignation of the former chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Both

11


-----

appointments are on an interim basis until December 31, 2017. Dr. Barthold Piening, chief technical
officer, will continue in his role on the Executive Board. See ‘‘Management.’’

On September 1, 2017, the Sponsors have announced their intention to appoint Dr. Claudio Albrecht as
new chief executive officer and Mr. Mark Keatley as new chief financial officer of STADA. While these
managers have not been formally nominated or appointed to positions at the Target yet and are currently
acting as consultants for the Issuers, the Sponsors intend to appoint them as soon as practicable following
the reconstitution of the Supervisory Board. Dr. Albrecht is expected to lead STADA’s transition under its
new majority owners in the short-to-medium term and to assume a non-executive leadership role in due
course, once a new CEO has been appointed to lead STADA in the long term. See ‘‘—Our Strengths—
_Highly Committed Sponsors with Key Management Support.’’_

**_Status of Previously Disclosed Earnings Guidance_**

The Target disclosed earnings guidance for the year ending December 31, 2017, and for subsequent
periods, in its Group Management Report to its Annual Report. The Issuers’ expectations about the Target
Group’s earnings for the year ending December 31, 2017, and subsequent periods may differ from the
Target Group’s earnings guidance, particularly in light of the implementation of the Sponsors’ strategies
and business plan, and therefore you should not rely on this previously-disclosed guidance when making an
investment decision in regard to the Notes. The Issuers do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to
update such earnings guidance.

(1) As of September 22, 2017, the Sponsors indirectly control (through wholly owned intermediate holding companies) 65% of the
issued and outstanding common shares of the Target. See ‘‘Principal Shareholders.’’ Because the Sponsors, directly or indirectly,
acquired less than 100% of the Target shares, the Target will continue to have minority shareholders and, pending the
occurrence of the Control Date, the Sponsors will not be entitled to control the management of the Target.

(2) The Sponsors intend to establish a management equity plan for the benefit of the Target’s management. See ‘‘Management—
_Share Ownership.’’ The Target will be a Post-Control Date Guarantor. There will be significant limitations and restrictions on_

the influence that the Issuers may exercise as indirect shareholders of the Target (including with respect to compliance by the
Target and its subsidiaries with the covenants under the Indentures), unless and until the Control Date occurs. As a result, there
can be no assurance that, prior to the Control Date, the Target and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise
have been prohibited by the covenants under the Indentures had those covenants been applicable. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the Group and will not control the Group_
_until the Control Date.’’_

(3) In connection with the Transactions, the Sponsors provide the Equity Contribution in the form of equity and quasi equity
(including common and preferred equity instruments and deeply subordinated shareholder loans), the proceeds of which have
been or will be contributed to the Senior Notes Issuer through intermediate holding companies. As of September 22, 2017, the
Equity Contribution provided by the Sponsors is equal to A1,612 million.

(4) On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco on a
senior subordinated basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Control Date
Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes and (b) 120 days from the
earlier of (i) the Control Date and (ii) the date on which the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are first utilized by a member of
the Target Group and, in each case, substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
the Senior Notes will additionally be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by each such Post-Control Date Guarantor. The
Senior Notes will be general senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer, rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing
and future indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes, rank senior
in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Senior Notes, be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer and
its subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior Notes (including obligations under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations), to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness and be effectively subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, including their obligations
to trade creditors. Each Senior Notes Guarantee will be a general senior subordinated obligation of the relevant Senior Notes
Guarantor, be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Senior Notes Guarantor
(including the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations), rank
_pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of that Senior Notes Guarantor that is not_
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Note Guarantee of that Senior Notes Guarantor, rank senior in right of payment
to all existing and future indebtedness of that Senior Notes Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the Senior
Notes Guarantee of that Senior Notes Guarantor, be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of that
Senior Notes Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior Notes
(including obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging
obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness and be structurally subordinated to
any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of that Senior Notes Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Notes,
including their obligations to trade creditors. The Senior Notes will be secured as of the Issue Date (i) on a first-priority basis by
a pledge of the shares in the Senior Notes Issuer, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the
Senior Notes Issuer to German Midco and a pledge of the material bank accounts of the Senior Notes Issuer and (ii) on a
second-priority basis by security interests in the Shared Issue Date Collateral. See ‘‘—The Offering—Collateral.’’ The validity
and enforceability of the Senior Notes Guarantees and the security and the liability of each Senior Notes Guarantor and
security provider will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’ See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Acquisition—We do not, and may not in the future, own all of the outstanding common shares in the Target and there can be no_
_assurance that a DPLTA will be approved and/or the Target’s shares will be delisted’’ and ‘‘—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—_
_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior_
Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

(5) On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed solely by German Holdco, the direct majority shareholder of
the Target. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor
provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and (b) 120 days from the earlier of (i) the Control Date and
(ii) the date on which the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are first utilized by a member of the Target Group and, in each case,
substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes will
additionally be guaranteed on a senior basis by each such Post-Control Date Guarantor. The Senior Secured Notes will be
general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be general senior
obligations of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor. The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will
rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including obligations
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations), rank senior in right of payment to any
existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including the Senior Notes Guarantees), be effectively
subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by
property and assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such indebtedness, and be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors. On the Issue
Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Senior Secured Issue Date
Collateral. In addition, within no later than 120 days from the earlier of (a) the Control Date and (b) the date on which the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities are first utilized by a member of the Target Group, and, in each case, substantially
simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a
first-priority basis by the Senior Secured Post-Control Date Collateral. The Senior Secured Post-Control Date Collateral will

also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a _pari passu basis. See ‘‘—The Offering—_
_Collateral.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the security and the liability of each_
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and security provider will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’ See also ‘‘Risk_
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—We do not, and may not in the future, own all of the outstanding common shares in the_
_Target and there can be no assurance that a DPLTA will be approved and/or the Target’s shares will be delisted’’ and ‘‘—Risks_
_Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.’’ The security_
interests in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released under certain
circumstances.

(6) As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, the Target and its subsidiaries organized in Germany, England and Wales,
The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland accounted for 40% of the consolidated assets, 38% of the
consolidated sales and 47% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group. The validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of each Guarantor under a Guarantee will be subject to the limitations
described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and Security Interests.’’_

(7) In connection with the Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for committed facilities of up to A2,350 million
(equivalent) in the form of (i) the Term Loan B Facility in an amount of A1,700 million (equivalent) and (ii) the Revolving
Credit Facility in an amount of A400 million. All of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will guarantee the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities on a senior basis, _pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and senior to the Senior Notes_
Guarantees. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured on a first-ranking basis as of the Issue Date by the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement’’ and
_‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ As of September 22, 2017, the Term Loan B Facility_
has been drawn in an amount of A250 million and the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn in an amount of A37 million.

(8) On August 25, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated German Holdco as its wholly owned subsidiary and
contributed all of the STADA shares held by it as of this date to German Holdco. We expect that the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will also contribute to German Holdco any additional STADA shares it may in the future purchase in the open market or
otherwise. As a result, any pledge of any shares in the Target acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Holdco
that will form part of the Senior Secured Issue Date Collateral will be granted by German Holdco.

(9) As of June 30, 2017, the Target Group had Existing Debt with a book value of A1,432 million. A portion of such Existing Debt in
a principal amount equal to A1,380 million (and with a book value of A1,376 million as of June 30, 2017) has become prepayable
at the option of the holders and lenders in respect thereof, as the Acquisition triggered their right to exercise a change of
control put right at par within approximately 142 days following the First Settlement Date. The residual amount of Existing
Debt with a book value of A56 million, which does not provide for a change of control put right, is prepayable at STADA’s
option. The aggregate principal amount of Existing Debt that is prepayable at STADA’s option, including both instruments with
and without a change of control put right, is equal to A315 million (and a book value of A315 million as of June 30, 2017). As a
result, subject to the proportion of holders and lenders who exercise their change of control put right and the amount STADA
decides to refinance in its discretion, up to the entire amount of the Existing Debt (with a book value of A1,432 million and an
aggregate principal amount A1,436 million) may be refinanced in connection with the Transactions. We may determine (or, prior
to the Control Date, the Executive Board may determine) that the Existing Debt at the Target should remain outstanding and
not be refinanced with drawings under the Term Loan B Facility. Prior to the Control Date, any such Existing Debt that remains
outstanding will be structurally senior to the obligations under the Notes. After the Control Date, any remaining Existing Debt
may share in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral by operation of the negative pledges in favor of the lenders under such
Existing Debt. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

Each of these covenants will be subject to significant exceptions
and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants.’’_

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as the

Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer undertakes
to procure compliance by members of the Target Group to any
term of the Indentures where any term of the Indentures is
expressed directly or indirectly to apply to a member of the Target
Group, such term, undertaking or requirement will be subject to all
limitations and restrictions on the influence the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may exercise as a shareholder of the Target (or the
access it has to the relevant information in such capacity, as
applicable) in accordance with mandatory German corporate law
but without any obligation to compensate or to offer any
compensation in accordance with the German Stock Corporation
Act (including, but not limited to, Sections 311 _et seq. German_
Stock Corporation Act) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no
breach of any such term, undertaking or requirement and no
default or event of default shall occur if having exercised all such

nevertheless breached).

Each of the covenants in the Indentures will be subject to
significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the

**U.S. Federal Income Tax**
**Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . .** For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations

24


-----

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction
and will not be so registered. The Notes are subject to restrictions
on transferability and resale. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Holders of
the Notes will not have the benefit of any exchange or registration
rights.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should
consider carefully all the information in this offering memorandum
and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set
forth in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section before making a decision
whether to invest in the Notes.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is no existing
market. Although the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised
us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at any

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_Unless otherwise noted, the following tables present the Target’s summary financial information and have been_
_derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements, that have been prepared in_
_accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere herein and the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial_
_Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’_
_‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

_All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of the Target and its_
_subsidiaries. Accordingly, all references to ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ ‘‘our’’ or the ‘‘Target Group’’ in respect of historical_
_financial information in this offering memorandum are to the Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated_
_basis._

_The financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, is unaudited and has been calculated by_
_taking the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and adding it to the difference between_
_the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the six months ended June 30, 2016. The_
_financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, has not been audited or reviewed by our_
_auditors, is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting_
_principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily representative_
_of our results of operations for such a period or any future period or any financial position at any past or future_
_date._

_This offering memorandum includes certain financial information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and_
_Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, on an adjusted basis to give pro forma_
_effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, including combined financial data as_
_adjusted to reflect the effect of the Transactions on each Issuer’s indebtedness as if the Transactions had_
_occurred on June 30, 2017, and on each Issuer’s interest expense as if the Transactions had occurred on July 1,_
_2016. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, has been_
_prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what each Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense_
_would have been, had the Transactions occurred on June 30, 2017, or July 1, 2016, respectively; nor does it_
_purport to project each Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The pro forma financial_
_information as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, has not been prepared in accordance with_
_IFRS. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial_
_information as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, have been audited or reviewed in accordance_
_with any generally accepted auditing standards._

_Results of operations for prior years or periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the_
_full year or any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and_
_ratios that we report herein, such as EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted_
_EBITDA (each as defined in this offering memorandum) and leverage and interest coverage ratios, are not_
_financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or HGB and, as such, may be calculated by_
_other companies using different methodologies and having different results. Therefore, these performance_
_indicators and ratios are not directly comparable to similar figures and ratios reported by other companies._

(1) Segment data excludes income and expenses at the holding company level.

(2) We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of operations
attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates
as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under
IFRS, but also on a constant currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure titled constant-currency sales. Constant-currency
sales is used to adjust for the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro
denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this measure
facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of the Target Group’s operations. For a reconciliation
between the foreign exchange rates used for reporting purposes in our Financial Statements and the foreign exchange rates
used for purposes of the calculation of constant-currency sales, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP
_Financial Measures—Constant-Currency Sales.’’_

(3) For all periods presented, financial information for the Generics segment includes the results of operations of our former
Commercial Business segment. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Our Reporting Segments—Operating Segments.’’_

(*) Based on the assumptions set forth in ‘‘—The Transactions,’’ including that we have acquired 100% of the issued and
outstanding common shares in the Target at the specified prices.

(1) We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of operations
attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates
as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under
IFRS, but also on a constant currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure titled constant-currency sales. Constant-currency
sales is used to adjust for the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro
denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this measure
facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of the Target Group’s operations. For a reconciliation
between the foreign exchange rates used for reporting purposes in our Financial Statements and the foreign exchange rates
used for purposes of the calculation of constant-currency sales, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP
_Financial Measures—Constant-Currency Sales.’’_

(2) We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Management Adjusted
EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items as set forth below. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as
Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-off and pro forma adjustments and expected cost savings identified
by the Sponsors as set forth below.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as
depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions
or regimes, we believe EBITDA based measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of
the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we present Non-GAAP Measures such as EBITDA, Management
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by
certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. Our
Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies
and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating
results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures
of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our financial statements and using
these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—
_Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’_

(A) Relates to measurement effects due to purchase price allocations and significant product acquisitions, using the year
ended December 31, 2013, as the baseline.

(B) Relates to transactional foreign exchange losses recorded in the income statement resulting from the fluctuation of the
Russian ruble and other significant currencies in the market region CIS/Eastern Europe during the periods presented. As
of January 1, 2017, STADA has discontinued this adjustment in its reporting, as it believes the significant fluctuations
experienced in more recent periods have returned to a more normal level.

(C) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary expenses in respect of the year ended December 31, 2016, in particular the
restructuring of our German business, the termination of certain parts of our aesthetics business, expenses related to the
deconsolidation of our Egyptian subsidiary and the termination of our former Omega Distribution Agreement.

(D) Relates to fees paid by the Target for financial advisory, legal and other professional fees in connection with the
Acquisition and the Takeover Offer.

(E) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary income and expenses.

(F) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-off and pro forma
adjustments and expected cost savings identified by the Sponsors.

In conducting due diligence on the Target, the Sponsors commissioned third-party due diligence reports to analyze the
Target’s financial condition and operations. As a result of their findings, the Sponsors identified certain adjustments set
forth below that could be considered one-off in nature, result from the Transactions or reverse certain Target management
adjustments included in Management Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, the Sponsors commissioned a due diligence report
from a leading global consulting firm to analyze the potential for achieving cost savings at the Target which result from
both management’s cost savings initiatives and cost savings initiatives expected to be implemented by the Sponsors. This
leading global consulting firm estimated that the Target will be able to realize the cost savings set forth below by the end
of the year 2018. The calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on various assumptions and estimates by
external consultants and management. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the
adjustments below. As a result, while the Issuers believe that these adjustments and potential cost savings are reasonable
estimates, the actual results and cost savings in any given period may differ from those estimated herein. See also
‘‘Forward-Looking Statements,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—We do not, and may not in the future, own
_all of the outstanding common shares in the Target,’’ ‘‘—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the Target_
_Group and will not control the Target Group until the Control Date’’ and ‘‘—We may not be able to realize the anticipated_
_operational efficiencies and cost savings in the Acquisition.’’_

This presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is for informational purposes only. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the items above for which an adjustment is made
occurred on or prior to July 1, 2016. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included in this offering memorandum because we
believe that it provides a useful measure of our results of operations after giving effect to the Transactions and the
initiatives described below; however, these numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent accounting firm, and this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS.
You should not consider Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure
derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including
those in our industry, may calculate a similarly-titled financial measure differently from us, and so the presentation of

such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See also

(i) Represents the estimated run-rate increase in EBITDA after giving effect to savings that we expect to realize by the end
of the year 2018 in our (a) procurement costs for finished goods and bulk finished goods in line with industry benchmarks
achieved through the consolidation of our highly fragmented supplier base, as well as through renegotiation of our
procurement supply contracts, (b) procurement costs for active pharmaceutical ingredients in line with industry
benchmarks achieved through, among other things, greater use of requests for quotation, higher standardization of
procurement processes and renegotiation of our procurement supply contracts and (c) packaging costs which, following a
detailed cost analysis, we believe we can realize through renegotiation of our packaging supplier contracts and revised
packaging standards.

(ii) Represents the estimated run-rate increase in EBITDA after giving effect to savings in our manufacturing and
distribution costs that we expect to realize by the end of the year 2018 through insourcing the manufacturing of certain of
our products through line extensions and capability building, higher specialization of manufacturing facilities,
consolidation of our manufacturing footprint to realize economies of scale, the conversion of existing sites into ‘‘hub sites’’
with a greater distribution area, operational improvements in our top product lines in the United Kingdom, Russia and
Serbia, supply chain optimization, including hub, route and order size optimization and renegotiations with our thirdparty providers of logistics services.

(iii) Represents the estimated run-rate increase in EBITDA after giving effect to savings in our sales, general and
administrative expenses that we expect to realize by the end of the year 2018 through centralization and consolidation of
our IT and finance infrastructure, initiatives aimed at lowering our expenses for travel, fleet and facilities and other areas
and further optimization of our sales and marketing organization.

(iv) Represents the estimated run-rate increase in EBITDA after giving effect to other cost savings that we expect to realize by
the end of the year 2018 through the delayering of our organizational structure through the continued elimination of
unnecessary corporate entities and the streamlining of our organization, lower regulatory, registration and other costs
realized through the continued reduction in our SKU complexity, with initiatives aimed at the discontinuation of certain
smaller-volume products and cross-functional initiatives.

We expect to incur A70 million in costs to achieve the expected cost savings set forth above. We also intend to implement
other cost savings which are still to be quantified and therefore excluded from the adjustments set forth above, including
benefits resulting from the installation of centers of excellence, a streamlined supply chain organization and a further
optimization of our research and development expenses.

(3) EBITDA margin represents, in any period, EBITDA for such period, divided by sales for such period. Management Adjusted
EBITDA margin represents, in any period, Management Adjusted EBITDA for such period, divided by sales for such period.
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin represents, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for
such period, divided by sales for such period.

(4) We define capital expenditures as total capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and financial
assets. We define Adjusted Capital Expenditures as capital expenditures, excluding payments for significant investments and

(5) Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents, for any period, Management Adjusted EBITDA, less Adjusted Capital Expenditures.

(6) Cash Conversion represents, for any period, Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Management Adjusted EBITDA.

(7) Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness represents the pro forma financial debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is
secured by a lien on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, including the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (but excluding the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s guarantee of the Senior Notes which is secured with a secondranking lien on a portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any Existing Debt at the Target Group), less pro forma
cash and cash equivalents (including cash and cash equivalents of the Target Group as of June 30, 2017), after giving effect to
the Transactions (including the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and repayment of the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities) as
if they had occurred on June 30, 2017 and assuming that we acquired 100% of the Target shares and repaid all of the Existing
Debt on such date.

(8) Pro forma net indebtedness represents the pro forma financial debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including the Senior
Secured Notes, its Senior Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, but excluding A3.0 million of finance
leases, less pro forma cash and cash equivalents (including cash and cash equivalents of the Target Group as of June 30, 2017)
after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (including the offering of the Notes and repayment of the Bridge Facilities) as
if they had occurred on June 30, 2017 and assuming that we acquired 100% of the Target shares and repaid all of the Existing
Debt on such date.

(9) Pro forma interest expense represents the estimated interest expense of the Group on a pro forma basis for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions (including the offering of the Notes and repayment of the Bridge
Facilities) as if they had occurred on July 1, 2016, subject to the assumptions set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ including the
assumption that we acquired 100% of the Target shares and repaid all of the Existing Debt on such date. This reflects the
interest expense in connection with debt incurred under our existing finance leases, the Senior Notes and Senior Secured Notes
offered hereby and debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that will be outstanding after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, assuming an imputed weighted average interest rate for the Term Loan B Facility, but excluding any Existing Debt
at the Target Group. Pro forma interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent
what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on July 1, 2016, nor does it purport to project
our interest expense for any future period or our financial position at any future date.

(10) As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held directly or indirectly through German Holdco 65% of the
Target’s issued and outstanding common shares. As a result, if the ratio of pro forma net senior secured indebtedness to Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA was calculated giving effect to (i) the drawings as of September 22, 2017 of A250 million under the
Term Loan B Facility and A37 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (which is expected to be refinanced by drawings under
the Term Loan B Facility in the near-term), (ii) 65% of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (iii) 65% of the Existing Debt net
of the cash and cash equivalents of the Target Group as of June 30, 2017, the ratio of pro forma net senior secured indebtedness
to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA would be 5.02x.

(11) As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held directly or indirectly through German Holdco 65% of the
Target’s issued and outstanding common shares. As a result, if the ratio of pro forma net indebtedness to Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA was calculated giving effect to (i) the drawings as of September 22, 2017 of A250 million under the Term Loan B
Facility and A37 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (which is expected to be refinanced by drawings under the Term
Loan B Facility in the near-term), (ii) 65% of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (iii) 65% of the Existing Debt net of the
cash and cash equivalents of the Target Group as of June 30, 2017, the ratio of pro forma net indebtedness to Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA would be 5.99x.

(12) As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held directly or indirectly through German Holdco 65% of the
Target’s issued and outstanding common shares. As a result, if the ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma interest
expense was calculated giving effect to (i) the drawings as of September 22, 2017 of A250 million under the Term Loan B Facility
and A37 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (which is expected to be refinanced by drawings under the Term Loan B
Facility in the near-term), (ii) 65% of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and (iii) 65% of the Existing Debt net of the cash and
cash equivalents of the Target Group as of June 30, 2017, the ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma interest
expense would be 3.92x.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should carefully_
_consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this offering memorandum before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could adversely_
_affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and accordingly the value of the_
_Notes. This section describes the risks and uncertainties that we believe are material, but these risks and_
_uncertainties may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which_
_we are currently unaware or those which we deem immaterial, may also result in decreased sales, assets and_
_cash inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events that could result in a decline in the_
_value of the Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of_
_operations and prospects. The order in which the risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of_
_their occurrence or the magnitude of their potential impact on our business, financial position, results of_
_operations and prospects or on the trading price of the Notes._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

The risks that might have a material impact on the business operations of the Issuers and the Group
include the following:

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may adversely affect our sales, margins and operations._**

Our industry is highly competitive and is driven by a variety of factors, including price, reliability of quality,
local market expertise, distribution channels, portfolio breadth, marketing, packaging and brand loyalty.
Our two segments, Generics and Branded Products, face intense competition from our competitors’
products.

Many of our competitors are well-known pharmaceutical companies with substantial financial and other
resources. Companies with more resources may have a greater ability to conduct the development work
necessary to obtain marketing authorizations. Our products could, for example, be rendered obsolete or
uneconomical through the development of new products or technological advances in manufacturing or
production by our competitors. Our competitors’ products may also be, or be perceived as being, more
effective or more efficiently marketed and sold than our products. Our competitors may also be able to
sustain a deliberate substantial reduction in the price of their products or services for longer periods. This
is likely to result in significant price pressure in an increasingly commoditized market, which, in turn, may
reduce our sales and market share. In addition, competition in certain of our markets is particularly intense
due to the use of public tenders. Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical products have been
implemented (by both public and private entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate,
such as Germany, in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private entities
do not directly set the prices of pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products),
rather manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and
governments or private entities select a winning bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing
practices and reimbursement of drugs. See ‘‘—Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender
_systems could lead to delivery bottlenecks or unintentional increase in inventories.’’_

The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by continuous product development and technological
change. Entry of new players in any of our markets may make it difficult for us to increase our market
share, retain existing competitive positions or access new markets at all. If we fail to maintain our
competitive position, through either product development or effective marketing, or if any of our larger
competitors engage in pricing competition with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes.

**_We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and changes in these regulations, or failure by us or any of our_**
**_third party suppliers to comply with regulations, could harm our business._**

We are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulations. These regulations govern, among
other things, the development, authorization, manufacturing and procurement of contract manufacturing,
wholesale distribution and supply, pharmacovigilance and promotion of our products. See ‘‘Regulation.’’
While the regulations in the European Union are to a certain extent streamlined, the regulatory
environment outside Europe is fragmented and varies by country. Globally, we market our products in

37


-----

approximately 125 countries, mainly across Europe, the MENA region, Asia, Australia and South America,
and each of these countries may regulate these areas differently.

In our Generics segment, we sell unbranded generics products mostly comprised of prescription products.
In most countries, the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly (for example through
statutory price reductions) or indirectly (for example through reference and prices reimbursement rates
payable by the health insurance system, mandatory discounts, terms and/or requirements concerning
discounts, the creation of framework conditions to stimulate market forces and competition). Pricing also
may be influenced by supranational regulations in the European Union. Any changes in these regulations
or procedural rules, such as those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the
profitability of individual products and, in exceptional cases, could render the market introduction of a new
product unprofitable.

The regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate rigorously monitor and enforce compliance
with the relevant regulations by pharmaceutical companies, and our operations are subject to periodic
inspections by the relevant regulatory authorities in our markets. As a manufacturer of pharmaceutical
products, we are, for example, subject to principles of good manufacturing practice (‘‘GMP’’) and good
distribution practice (‘‘GDP’’), and compliance with these principles is assessed by the competent
regulators via regular site audits. See ‘‘Regulation—EU Pharmaceutical Regulatory Regime—Manufacturing
_and Contract Manufacturing’’ and ‘‘Business—Procurement, Production and Quality Management—Highest_
_Quality and Safety Standards.’’ Following these inspections, the relevant regulator may issue notices listing_
the conditions that inspectors believe may violate GMP, GDP or other applicable regulations, and warning
letters that could modify certain activities identified during the inspection. Failure to comply with the
applicable regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of
products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, suspension of the review of our product
applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution, as well as reputational harm,
reduced sales and market share. Moreover, the production of biologics and biosimilars products is subject
to a particularly complex regulation, which is also unclear in certain countries. Failure to comply with such
regulations may lead to production failures, recalls or fines. In addition, we could incur substantial
remediation costs. If any of these risks materialize, our sales could be materially and adversely affected.

While we believe that we are taking adequate measures to mitigate the regulatory risk, there is no
assurance that, should regulatory scrutiny further increase, they will continue to be effective. In addition,
continuing compliance with increased regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase our costs. We also have
affiliations, in-licensing agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory
approvals of their processes and products. These third parties are subject to similar regulatory compliance.
If any of those third parties does not comply with our regulatory requirements, we could be adversely
affected if their non-compliance results in an interruption in our supply of raw materials or ingredients or,
in the case of any of our licensors, it hinders our ability to produce our in-licensed products.

Any failure by us or any of our third party suppliers or licensors to comply with governmental regulations,
or any regulatory action taken against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are exposed to changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory factors which are_**
**_beyond our control._**

Our results of operations have been, and continue to be, affected by the conditions in the global economy.
For example, international conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the political
situation in certain countries in which we operate, such as the United Kingdom, may adversely affect the
macroeconomic environment. See ‘‘—We operate manufacturing facilities and have significant sales in Russia,
_which has experienced conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be_
_the subject of international sanctions’’ and ‘‘—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the_
_European Union may have a negative effect on our business.’’ These events have influenced, and may_
continue to influence, the development of our sales in the relevant markets.

While sales in our Generics segment, which mostly comprises non-discretionary prescription products, are
less vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, our results of operations in the Branded Products segment,
which is mostly comprised of self-pay OTC products, is more sensitive. An economic downturn and lower
household incomes can significantly depress demand in the self-payment market, _i.e. the market for_
pharmaceutical products for which consumers are not reimbursed as part of their individual national
health insurance plan.

38


-----

We believe that we are particularly exposed to a deterioration in the Russian economy. Russia accounted
for A243 million, or 11%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. Russia does not have a
comprehensive state healthcare system, and we estimate that the Russian self-payment market makes up
94% of the Russian pharmaceuticals market. As a result, Russia’s recent economic deterioration had, and
any future downturn may have, a particularly negative impact on our sales. In addition, the United
Kingdom accounted for A198 million, or 9%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2016, 88% of
which was in Branded Products. As a result, we believe we are also exposed to any deterioration in the UK
economy, and there can be no assurance that Brexit (as defined below) or other factors may not result in a
decline in the economic condition of the United Kingdom. In addition, our Generics segment is also
exposed to fluctuations in the economy to the extent economic, political and regulatory factors induce
cost-containment reform measures in any country, which could affect reimbursement rates and our sales of
prescription drugs. For example, the sustained economic downturn in Spain has resulted in a number of
cost-containment measures in recent years. See ‘‘—Existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform
_measures by government health authorities or government-sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect_
_our business.’’_

Any of these factors, or others that we cannot anticipate, may adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under
the Notes.

**_Existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities or government-_**
**_sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business._**

In various countries where we operate, government health authorities provide healthcare at low direct cost
to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored healthcare system. The continuing increase in healthcare expenditure has therefore
been the subject of considerable government attention in many of the countries in which we operate,
particularly as public resources have been stretched by the global economic crisis. Further, in recent years,
the increasing average age of the population and the associated increasing demand for pharmaceutical
products has led to rising healthcare costs.

Increasing expenditure on healthcare has been the subject of considerable public attention. In recent years,
many countries across the globe have discussed or implemented a measure of healthcare reform. The
primary focus of these reforms was to introduce cost-containment measures and optimize governmental
healthcare spending, particularly for prescription drugs, which account for a major part of our sales.
Measures implemented in line with these reforms are fragmented and vary by country. The Russian
government, for example, has released a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (‘‘VEP’’) which are
subject to mandatory price caps. Overpricing can result in fines and other penalties. Certain European
countries have introduced numerous austerity measures to lower healthcare spending, including
mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules. In certain cases, reimbursements for
high-priced drugs were refused. The United Kingdom and Germany introduced new systems to determine
cost effectiveness of drugs, which will decide the reimbursement level for a drug. In Spain the
government’s pricing and reimbursement policy is focused on cost-containment measures as they attempt
to reduce the financial deficit, which has repeatedly resulted in price cuts, reductions to wholesale and
retail margins and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs since 2000; we believe the pace at which these
regulatory measures are enacted has accelerated in recent years. The Spanish government has also enacted
four royal decree-laws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical industry by means of price
reduction of older pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs and medical devices, and
limitations for the numbers of products eligible for a reimbursement under the Spanish National Health
Service. Certain countries also cut their healthcare expenditure budgets or fixed them at a particular
amount. Furthermore, mandatory price cuts were introduced in respect of both generic and patented
drugs.

While most of our Branded Products are non-reimbursable OTC drugs, which are generally less affected
by the above measures, those measures may affect our Generics segment, which is mostly comprised of
prescription products, in a number of ways. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive
for any Generics product we develop in the future. As a result, we may be disincentivized from developing
and marketing new products or from entering new markets. Existing regulations that affect the price of
pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before our products are approved for
marketing. Our products may not be considered cost effective or adequate third-party reimbursement may
not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an adequate return on our

39


-----

investment. The governments of the countries where we operate may, in the future, implement further
regulations that impose additional pressure on the price of pharmaceutical products.

Any of the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Obtaining and maintaining necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products is time_**
**_consuming, and may not in each instance prove successful._**

We must obtain a marketing authorization and other regulatory certifications, licenses and approvals prior
to marketing or manufacturing new pharmaceutical products, which applies to both Generics and Branded
Products. See ‘‘Regulation’’ and ‘‘—We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and changes in these
_regulations, or failure by us or any of our third party suppliers to comply with regulations, could harm our_
_business.’’ Although less onerous than for originator pharmaceutical companies, the process of obtaining_
marketing authorizations and other regulatory certifications, licenses and approvals to manufacture and
market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming and costly. Depending on the country and
therapeutic area, issuance of an approval may take over two years. As the authorization process is
time-consuming, we may be unable to realize the momentum for the launch of new products, which may
result in the loss of sales and market share. To the extent that we are unable to secure timely approvals for
new products, we will depend on our existing products to maintain our sales. There is no assurance that
these products will continue to remain competitive and generate sufficient sales over time.

There is no assurance that we will obtain the governmental approval of any application we submit for the
commercial sale of a product in time, or at all. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain or
maintain regulatory approval in respect of our products could adversely affect our operating results by
restricting or delaying the introduction of new products. For example, the EMA requested further clinical
data in connection with the pending approval for pegfilgrastim, and we and our license partner, Gedeon
Richter, agreed in November 2016 to withdraw the approval application and resubmit it once all the data
has been successfully collected. If health or safety concerns arise with respect to a product, we may be
forced to withdraw it from the market and could face legal action if any harm came from the use of such
product. Furthermore, our products must be successfully registered in the markets in which they are
commercialized. For example, in the Generics segment, a significant factor in the development and
approval of each product is the strict observance of commercial property rights, such as patents and
supplementary protection certificates.

Moreover, if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a drug, it may be limited with respect to the
indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for
the drug. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our pharmaceutical products could
result in restrictions on the use of a drug including possible withdrawals of the drug from the market. Any
delays in obtaining the governmental approval or authorization of new or existing products may have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_If we are unable to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new Generics Products in a timely manner,_**
**_it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to perform our_**
**_obligations under the Notes._**

We are focused on generics, and therefore only conduct limited proprietary research on new drugs. As a
result, we do not typically incur material research expenses. As a generics company, however, we incur
development costs in connection with marketing authorizations and the production of our new products, as
well as other activities that facilitate their commercialization. As a result, future results of operations
depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new
products in a timely manner. The development, manufacturing and commercialization process is time
consuming. We must develop, test and manufacture our products as well as successfully register them in
each relevant jurisdiction. All of our products must meet and continue to comply with regulatory and safety
standards in each of the markets they are to be commercialized. There is no assurance that the necessary
marketing authorizations will be obtained in a timely manner or at all and delays or inability to obtain
regulatory approval could adversely affect our business. See ‘‘—Obtaining and maintaining necessary
_government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products is time consuming, and may not in each_
_instance prove successful.’’_

40


-----

Our products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as
expected or may face greater than expected competition. In addition, our new products may be unable to
achieve their planned value. Successful development and manufacture of new products also depends on
our ability to secure, on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, the required raw materials.
In addition, there is no assurance that our new products will be accepted by the medical community in our
target markets. See ‘‘—Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance
_of the products not only by end-users, but also by independent third parties, including public health insurers,_
_doctors and pharmacists depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate.’’ Finally, we are dependent on_
partnerships and joint ventures with third parties and we face the risk that some of these third parties may
fail to perform their obligations under the relevant contracts, thus reducing our ability to successfully
develop, manufacture or commercialize new products in a timely manner. See ‘‘—We are exposed to default
_or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of contracting parties’ failure to_
_meet their contractual obligations.’’_

Should any of the above risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes.

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims._**

From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters, including product liability claims, warranty
obligations claims, alleged violations of trade confidentiality and others. See also ‘‘Business—Legal
_Proceedings,’’ ‘‘—Our reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to product_
_liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived’’ and ‘‘—Third parties may claim that we infringe_
_their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products.’’_
When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in an
amount equal to our estimated liability. However, there can be no assurance that our provisions will be
sufficient to cover our actual litigation costs. In addition, third-party litigation, including litigation related
to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law, patent law and to the implementation of individual regulatory
requirements in the provision of healthcare at a national or supranational level, could have an indirect,
materially adverse impact on us and the market environment in which we operate.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved in six pending general litigation claims none
of which we consider to be material.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation
claims or similar matters under various laws or that product-specific provisions will be sufficient to cover
litigation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing
litigation under the laws of certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any
materially adverse effects on our business in such country.

Any of these events could result in considerable costs, including damages, legal fees and temporary or
permanent ban on the marketing of certain products and this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from_**
**_manufacturing and selling our products._**

There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry with respect to the manufacture, use
and sale of generic pharmaceutical products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of
patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Originator and generic pharmaceutical companies are
increasingly patenting not only the relevant molecules or manufacturing processes relating to a final
dosage product, but also formulations and production processes of active pharmaceutical ingredients.

While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon commercial property
rights of other parties, we believe that patent infringement claims are typical of our industry. While we
generally take great care in ensuring that new products we launch do not violate any intellectual property
rights of third parties and seek to refrain from selling products prior to the expiration of their patent
protection, there can be no assurance that an intellectual property infringement claim could not be brought
against us and that we would not be found to infringe on the commercial property rights of others. This is
also due to the fact that, in certain countries, such as Italy, patent applications are not publicly disclosed
until the patent is issued and, therefore, we may not be aware of currently filed patents.

41


-----

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved in four pending patent infringement actions.
We believe that the claims alleged in these actions have no merit and that we will not be required to make
any material compensation payment.

We may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, selling
or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
infringement. Furthermore, a significant third party claim could result in management’s attention being
distracted from current operations.

The outcome of intellectual property related proceedings could adversely affect, hinder, delay or prevent
the manufacture, use, marketing or sale of our products or processes. We may also be required to pay
substantial damages or change our product offerings or expend significant resources to develop
non-infringing products or processes. Any of the above could affect our ability to compete or have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

We rely, in part, on license, collaboration and other agreements to develop our product portfolio. For
example, we occasionally enter into research and development partnerships with universities. The
underlying collaboration agreements may provide that we are granted the exclusive license to
commercialize the final product. Our present and future licenses, collaborations and other intellectual
property related agreements may impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone,
royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us.
If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized
manner, we may be required to pay damages and our licensors may have the right to terminate the license.
If our license or other intellectual property related agreements are terminated, we may be required to
cease developing and commercializing drug candidates that are covered by the licensed intellectual
property.

In addition, our licensing, collaboration and other agreements the agreements under which we license
intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such
agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation
disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant
intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations
under the relevant agreement. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed
prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable
terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected drug candidates. For
example, such disputes may relate to: (i) the scope of rights granted under the agreement and other
interpretation related issues, (ii) the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual
property of the licensor that is not subject to the agreement, (iii) the sublicensing of patent and other rights
under our collaborative development relationships, (iv) our diligence obligations under the agreement and
what activities satisfy those diligence obligations, (v) the inventorship and ownership of inventions and
know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our
collaborators and (vi) the priority of invention of patented technology.

To help protect any proprietary know-how we develop and any inventions for which patents may be
unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we may have to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements. There can be no assurances that all of our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors
that have access to our trade secrets and confidential information will agree to enter into agreements
which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and
assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Even
where such persons entered into such agreements, these agreements may not provide adequate protection
for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or
disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how
or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other
proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.

If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain
the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant
program or drug candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Target Group’s net assets,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Industrial action or adverse labor relations could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our operating_**
**_results._**

Our operations depend on employees who are parties to collective bargaining arrangements, works
agreements and/or benefits from local applicable law, defined benefit plans, regulation or custom
regarding employee rights and benefits. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory employee relations or
negotiate acceptable labor agreements in future, the results could include work stoppages, strikes or other
industrial action or labor difficulties (including higher labor costs) at any or all of our global facilities.

While we believe that we have good relations with unions and employees generally, there can be no
assurance that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the
future. Any of these adverse labor situations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to product liability or contamination_**
**_issues, whether actual or perceived._**

Although generic companies, such as us, are engaged in the reproduction of pharmaceutical products and
their active pharmaceutical ingredients that are vetted by regulations and often have been in the market
for ten or more years, there is a risk that our Group may be liable, or incur costs related to, liability claims
if any of their products cause injury or are found unsuitable during development, manufacture, sale or use.
The risk exists even with respect to products that have received, or may receive in the future, regulatory
approval for commercial use. Moreover, our products could contain contaminated substances that we do
not identify during our manufacturing process, and adverse reactions resulting from human consumption
of these ingredients could occur. We could also be subject to product liability claims as a result of defective
raw materials we purchase from third parties. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved
in one such product liability claim in connection with one of our generics products distributed in France.
See ‘‘Business—Legal Proceedings.’’

Product liability lawsuits could be costly to defend, and could result in reduced sales, substantial monetary
awards to clinical trial participants or customers, harm to our brand and reputation, the inability to
commercialize products that we develop and diversion of management’s time, attention and resources.
Considerable sums in damages have been awarded in certain countries against pharmaceutical companies
due to physical harm allegedly caused by the use of certain products. Product liability claims may force us
to withdraw some of our products from the market, thus creating potential for further claims. Regardless
of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims would likely result in negative publicity, decreased demand
for any products that we may develop, injury to our reputation and suspension or withdrawal of clinical
trials and require us to incur significant legal fees. We currently have insurance coverage for product
liability claims. See ‘‘Business—Insurance.’’ However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all or
even a material part of a significant product liability claim. Furthermore, at any time, insurance coverage
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Our failure to successfully defend a product liability lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes.

**_Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by_**
**_end-users, but also by independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists_**
**_depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate._**

Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of products by
independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors, pharmacists, wholesalers, distributors,
hospitals, group purchasing organizations, government representatives and other retailers, as well as
end-users. In our Branded Products Segment, we rely to a significant extent on the strength of our brands
and reputation and our acceptance by the third party agents and distributors. Examples of our strongest
brands include APO-Go, Covonia, Ladival, Aqualor and Grippostad. Unanticipated side effects or
unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products or brands, or the brands of our in-licensed products,
could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed care
providers, pharmacies and other retailers, customers and patients.

43


-----

In addition to the strength of our brand and reputation, acceptance of any of our products among the
medical community depends upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. With respect
to Generics and prescription items in our Branded Products segment these factors include the following:

- acceptance by payors, physicians, pharmacists and end-customers of each product as an effective
treatment;

- whether a physician is receptive to our product and how quickly the physician adopts it as an accepted
treatment;

- the product’s price;

- the product’s perceived advantages and disadvantages relative to competing products or treatments;

- the prevalence and severity of side effects; and

- the adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies.

If our products have received a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities but do not achieve
an adequate level of acceptance by independent third parties, we may be unable to generate sufficient or
any sales from these products to make them profitable. If our products fail to maintain significant market
acceptance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_If our suppliers or we encounter problems manufacturing products or cease to manufacture products, our business_**
**_could suffer._**

We strive to deliver high quality pharmaceutical products to our customers. The manufacture of our
products is highly exacting and complex due, in part, to strict regulatory requirements governing their
manufacture. We rely on complex machinery and information technology systems to support our
manufacturing processes, as well as internal and external communications with respect to supplies, quality
control and distribution. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including
equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials
and environmental factors. If problems are severe, we may be forced to temporarily suspend all or part of
our production until the problems are rectified. Any of this is likely to result in increased costs, lost sales,
damage to customer relations, failure to perform existing contracts, time spent investigating the cause,
remedial costs and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. In
addition, although we have not encountered any material product recalls in recent years, where problems
are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be forced to recall products from
the market. In certain cases, we may face product liability claims and incur respective costs. See ‘‘—Our
_reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to product liability or contamination_
_issues, whether actual or perceived.’’_

The facilities used to manufacture our products are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory
authorities to assess compliance with the relevant principles of GMP. See ‘‘—We are subject to extensive
_governmental regulation and changes in these regulations, or failure by us or any of our third party suppliers to_
_comply with regulations, could harm our business.’’ While we manufacture most of our products, others are_
manufactured by our contract manufacturing partners. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring
that our products are manufactured in accordance with the principles of GMP and believe that we
diligently monitor our suppliers’ compliance within the applicable requirements, we do not control the
day-to-day activities of, and we are dependent on, the contract manufacturing partners for their
compliance with GMP requirements. If we or any of our suppliers were to violate the applicable principles
of GMP, we or such supplier could be fined, and the competent regulator could impose a complete
shutdown of such supplier’s non-compliant manufacturing plant. As a result, we could become subject to a
supply shortage with respect to the products we source from the sanctioned supplier. If our inventories of
these products turn out to be insufficient, this could adversely affect our sales. If our manufacturing
partners or we cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our specifications and the strict
requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities, our manufacturing contractors and we will not be able
to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our respective manufacturing facilities. If a regulatory
authority does not approve a facility for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such
approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities. Although we carry out
compliance checks, the occurrence or suspected occurrence of production not in line with our
specifications or regulatory requirements can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls

and enforcement action, with consequential damage to our reputation and the risk of product liability. The
investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause manufacturing delays, substantial
expense, lost sales and the delay of new product launches.

Any of the risks described above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our business could be adversely affected if we incur significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt-on_**
**_acquisitions or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions._**

In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and acquisitions, and we intend
to continue this combination in the future. Examples of our recent acquisitions during the periods
presented herein include our acquisition of the Argentinean generics manufacturer Laboratorio Vannier,
which is specialized in certain niches that are generally subject to only a low degree of price regulations
such as conditions of the central nervous system, cardiology and diabetes, a Serbian product portfolio
aimed at gastrointestinal disorders, the British Branded Products company Natures Aid Limited, a
well-known manufacturer of vitamins, minerals, food supplements and herbal products, the Russian
Branded Products AndroDoz and NeroDoz, which are positioned in the area of men’s health, SCIOTEC
Diagnostic Technologies GmbH, an important player in the development and marketing of
prescription-free, OTC products against enzymatic food intolerances (histamine, fructose and lactose
intolerance), the Russian Branded Products portfolio Aqualor and the production and distribution rights
for the Branded Product Flexitol for the United Kingdom and Ireland. Furthermore, we sold the French
company Laboratoires d’´etudes et de recherches en oligo ´el´ements th´erapie SA. We believe that none of
these acquisitions materially affected the comparability of our results of operations. Although there are no
material acquisitions currently pending or planned, acquisitions continue to be a part of our future growth
strategy.

Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected
benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. While we conduct due
diligence in preparation for each acquisition, it is possible that legal, tax and operational risks of the
respective target, some of which may be unknown or undisclosed to us at the time of the acquisition, may
materialize, have more severe consequences than expected or increase the costs for the integration of a
target. In addition, acquisitions are also subject to the risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the
payment of consideration greater than the target market value. Also, we may be unable to evaluate the
scale of a potential acquisition, which may result in being unable to allocate proper resources to execute
the acquisition and subsequent integration efficiently.

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent, among other things, on the successful integration of
the products and businesses we acquire at the expected costs, and their subsequent expansion into new
markets or into existing markets in which we operate. Such integration and expansion may put a strain on
our management resources, distracting our managers from their regular tasks and require additional
management resources to be deployed, especially where a large scale acquisition is involved. Although we
believe that our current managerial, administrative, technical and financial resources are capable of
supporting our recent and proposed future expansion, there is no assurance that our existing resources will
be sufficient for this purpose, or that we will be able to acquire necessary additional resources on
commercially acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may be unable to deploy sufficient resources to
integrate a large scale acquisition, which may result in us being unable to realize desired synergies. There is
also a risk that key employees of companies we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully
commercialize products and technologies that we acquire, may seek employment elsewhere, including with
our competitors. Any our failure to acquire, maintain and deploy adequate management, sales,
administrative, technical and financial resources to support our expansion, could undermine our
acquisition strategy.

In addition, our acquisitions of target companies or product portfolios may be subject to regulatory
approval. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for our future
acquisitions without unreasonable expenses and within a reasonable time period or at all.

Our failure to integrate acquired businesses and products, or to realize the intended synergies, may
prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our operations may be disrupted by accidents, equipment malfunctioning or other unexpected events._**

Although we believe that we have adopted and maintain adequate safety precautions, if one or more of our
production facilities were to suffer a serious accident, breakdowns, equipment malfunction or other
unexpected events, a part of our production capacity could be jeopardized and our sales and net income
would be materially adversely affected until we repair or find a replacement for any such facility or
machinery. While we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance to cover any such property and other
asset damages, depending on the risk and type of asset or property insured, any losses related to a serious
accident, equipment malfunction or other unexpected event could exceed the amount of this coverage. In
addition, the refurbishment or reconstruction of any of our production facilities or the construction of new
facilities could be subject to regulatory approval by the competent health authorities of the jurisdictions in
which they are located as well as the health authorities of some or all of the jurisdictions to which products
from such facilities are exported, which could result in significant delays in the resumption of product
manufacturing. If any of the above were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes.

**_Accidental contamination, non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or environmental, health_**
**_and safety litigation or liability, could adversely impact our business and operating results._**

Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals and include
hazardous or toxic materials. These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination,
events of non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal
injury, property damage and claims and litigation resulting from such events. If an accident occurs, or if
contamination is discovered, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages or fines, which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform
our obligations under the Notes. We are currently not aware of any material contamination incidents or
material non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws.

The environmental laws of many jurisdictions in which we operate may impose potential obligations to
clean up contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites that we acquire, own or operate, that we
formerly owned or operated, or for which we may otherwise have retained liability or where waste from
our operations was disposed. Were such environmental clean-up obligations to arise they could
significantly reduce our operating results. In particular, any financial accruals which we may make for these
obligations might be insufficient if the assumptions underlying the accruals proved to be incorrect, or if we
are held responsible for additional contamination.

Stricter environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs
and liabilities for us, and could result in handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or
pollutants being subjected to more rigorous scrutiny by relevant regulatory authorities than is currently the
case. Compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures, as well as other costs,
thereby potentially harming our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Failure to renew agreements with our material suppliers and wholesale customers on acceptable terms or the_**
**_termination of such agreements by material suppliers or wholesalers could harm our business._**

Although we have a large number of suppliers and customers and believe that our business is not
materially dependent on any single one of them, failure to renew contracts with material suppliers, such as
suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients, equipment (including, for example, medical devices) or
other items and material customers, such as hospitals, pharmacies and drug stores could negatively impact
our business. In addition, some of our major supply and wholesale contracts are subject to change of
control provisions that may grant the respective counterparties the right to terminate the relevant contracts
as a result of a change of control, which in certain but not all contracts may shorten the termination or
contract period originally contemplated under the contract. At the end of a contract’s term, which may be
accelerated as a result of a change of control termination, these suppliers or wholesalers have a choice to
either renegotiate their contract with us, increase or decrease its scope (with our consent), seek out our
competitors to provide the same or similar services or cease outsourcing of the relevant activity. Whenever
a contract expires or is due for renewal, suppliers and wholesalers may seek price adjustment from us. In
addition, these parties may seek a price adjustment when their business experiences significant volume
changes. Further, certain suppliers or wholesalers may seek to increase prices previously agreed with us

46


-----

due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the supplier or the
wholesaler. If our contracts are terminated either by a material supplier or wholesaler (for example, as a
result of a change of control event being triggered) or not extended upon their termination, if our material
suppliers or wholesalers shift business away from us, or if we are unsuccessful in retaining high renewal
rates and contract terms that are favorable to us, this can cause delays and may have a material adverse
effect on our business and our respective operating segments, financial condition, results of operations and
on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems could lead to delivery bottlenecks or unintentional_**
**_increase in inventories._**

Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical products have been implemented (by both public and private
entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate, such as Germany, in an effort to lower
prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private entities do not directly set the prices of
pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products) but manufacturers submit bids that
establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and governments or private entities select a winning
bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing practices and reimbursement for drugs.

Initially, the tender system in Germany resulted in intense price-based competition, which pushed pricing
of generics products to marginal-cost level. Although competition subsequently decreased and margins
have partially recovered, as many smaller competitors proved unreliable in terms of their ability to fulfill
large orders, there can be no assurance that new entrants will not intensify the level of competition again.
Moreover, tender systems implemented by governmental institutions or public health insurance
organizations could determine fluctuations in national markets leading to changes in large volumes of
demand of pharmaceutical products. These fluctuations have a direct consequence on our business. Even if
we undertake great efforts to avoid delivery bottlenecks or unintentional increase in inventories by way of
scenario calculations and specific operational positioning of the respective supply chain, these events
cannot generally be ruled out due to our extensive portfolio. Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Any significant increases in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our products_**
**_or their availability could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results._**

Affordable, high quality active ingredients or auxiliary materials are essential to our business due to the
nature of the products we manufacture. Active ingredients and auxiliary materials are generally available
from multiple suppliers and often sourced locally. We acquire these ingredients and auxiliary materials
directly from the suppliers or enter into contracts with manufacturers producing the pharmaceutical
products. Increased prices, rationing or shortages as well as fluctuation in prices can occur. In some cases,
we manage these risks through mechanisms aimed at reducing our financial exposure, such as price
escalation clauses (which link procurement prices to current selling prices) and specific procurement prices
for specific sales volumes. However, there can be no assurance that rapid cost increases or extended supply
shortages will not occur and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and our ability
to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to risks associated with cross border sales and purchases._**

We market our products in approximately 125 countries globally, with a direct presence in more than 30
countries from which we carry out our local and export sales. Due to differing regulatory regimes, certain
of our products may be classified as Generics in some countries and as Branded Products in others.
Different classifications could also result in pricing differences, which may be material. Cross border
operations are subject to risks, including but not limited to:

- inadequate protection of intellectual property;

- difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign
laws, regulations and treaties, some of which are subject to change;

- legal uncertainties regarding, and timing delays associated with, customs procedures, tariffs, import or
export licensing requirements and other trade barriers;

- differing local product preferences and product requirements;

47


-----

- increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts;

- risk of loss at sea or other delays in the delivery of products caused by transportation problems;

- differing tax regimes; and

- economic sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods (see ‘‘—Our international
_sales and operations increase the risks associated with economic and trade sanctions imposed by the_
_European Union and other jurisdictions’’)._

Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our operating results.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in many different countries._**

We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of generic and branded pharmaceutical products
which are available in approximately 125 countries, including Serbia, the United Kingdom, Germany,
Russia, Montenegro, Vietnam, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Argentina and Austria. Both of our
operations and those of our local sales and business partners in these countries may be subject to the
following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions;
expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict;
bribery and corruption; national and regional labor strikes; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax
policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of
products; anti-trust risks; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation
of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of
global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions, market opportunities and operating
restrictions; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. In addition, we or any of our local
business partners may be subject to legal proceedings regarding bribery and corruption in these countries,
and we are unable to ensure or monitor the lawful conduct of our business partners’ operations. These
factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_The pricing of cross-border transactions is often the subject of negotiation with tax authorities, and any adjustments_**
**_imposed may lead to greater or double taxation of profits._**

Most national tax authorities follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or
United Nations guidelines when considering the arm’s length nature of cross-border pricing of goods and
services. Adjustments made by a national tax authority may not lead to a corresponding adjustment in the
other tax jurisdiction. Also, even where a corresponding tax adjustment is allowed, national tax rates may
be different and may therefore increase our overall burden of taxation. Our cross-border trade is
increasing and, although we benchmark our intercompany pricing regularly, the risk of an adverse
adjustment will require constant monitoring, which may require a substantial amount of the management
resources. Potential discrepancies in the adjustments made by the tax authorities in certain jurisdictions
may result in an increased tax burden of our Group.

**_We operate manufacturing facilities and have significant sales in Russia, which has experienced conflicts with_**
**_certain of its neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be the subject of international sanctions._**

We operate two manufacturing facilities in Russia, which together employed 774 people as of
December 31, 2016, and Russia accounted for A242.6 million, or 11.3%, of our sales in 2016. Russia has
experienced conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries, including Ukraine. As a result of these
conflicts, Russia has become subject to international sanctions (including sanctions by the European Union
and Ukraine, which are most relevant to STADA’s business) some of which impose restrictions on imports
from Russia. These sanctions, coupled with low commodity prices, the devaluation of the Russian ruble
against other major currencies and high inflation, contributed to the decrease in our financial performance
in Russia since 2014, which affected both our sales and earnings. Some of these sanctions have recently
been extended in light of the continuing turmoil in Ukraine. While certain countries exempt
pharmaceutical products, such as ours, from the scope of their sanctions, no such exemption applies under
the Ukrainian sanctions regime. Because we serve the Ukrainian market through supplies from our
presence in Russia, these sanctions currently prevent us from making any sales into Ukraine, which
adversely affects our sales and profitability. Furthermore, the Ukrainian sanctions regime prohibits both
our Ukrainian operations and their financing banks from making payments into Russia. As a result, our
Russian presence is currently unable to collect its receivables against our Ukrainian operations from past

48


-----

deliveries. While discussions for a possible exemption for pharmaceutical products from the scope of these
sanctions are currently ongoing and we may be able to reroute our sales, these sanctions are currently
affecting our sales volume in Ukraine and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain an
exemption for our pharmaceutical products or reroute our sales in the near future or at all. In addition,
there is a risk that these countries may further expand the scope of their sanctions against Russia and that
other countries will impose similar sanctions in the future. See _‘‘—We are subject to risks associated with_
_cross border sales and purchases.’’_

Moreover, our manufacturing facilities in Russia could be disrupted by the conflict with Ukraine or by
other wars, political unrest, terrorist activity, or economic upheaval. Any such disruption could cause losses
in efficiencies, delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance
proceeds may not adequately compensate us for our losses. Furthermore, our operations in Russia may be
subject to risks arising from a less stable legal and regulatory framework and a less transparent
enforcement of the law. This could result in, _inter alia, an increased difficulty of enforcing contracts,_
collecting trade receivables, imposition of additional regulations, an increase in taxes or restriction of the
import of products. Any of these factors could potentially affect our sales and the operation of our
manufacturing facilities resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our international sales and operations increase the risks associated with economic and trade sanctions imposed by_**
**_the European Union and other jurisdictions._**

Economic sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods have in the past been imposed
on companies engaging in certain types of transactions with specified countries in which we do business,
including but not limited to Russia, Lebanon, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Iran. Although pharmaceutical
products are generally excluded from the scope of sanctions, our exports and transfers could be impacted
by such sanctions, which would limit our ability to trade with sanctioned individuals and/or sanctioned
countries and create practical complications with our exports, especially in terms of our interaction with
banks and receiving payments from sanctioned countries. For example, the competent authorities could
require banks to withhold payments due to us from sanctioned customers or countries. The European
Union and other countries have also enacted sanctions that prohibit transactions by their citizens and
domiciled entities involving certain specially designated individuals and entities from sanctioned countries
or participating in sanctioned activities including, but not limited to, terrorism and drug trafficking. In
addition, the European Union, the United States and certain other countries have recently implemented
measures against Russia in connection with the continuing turmoil in Ukraine. See ‘‘—We operate
_manufacturing facilities and have significant sales in Russia, which has experienced conflicts with certain of its_
_neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be the subject of international sanctions.’’_

The terms of legislation and other rules and regulations which establish sanctions regimes are often broad
in scope and difficult to interpret. Neither our affiliates nor we are currently the target of any such
sanctions and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable sanction
regulations. However, these regulations and their enforcement could potentially affect our sales in the
affected countries and force us to change or abandon our growth plans. In addition, failure to comply with
such regulations could result in significant fines.

Although we currently do not have a direct presence in the United States and are mainly affected by
sanctions implemented by the European Union, we may not exclude that sanctions enacted by the United
States could affect us in the future. Any of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions could result in a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our_**
**_business._**

The United Kingdom’s initiation of the process to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union following the national referendum in June 2016 (‘‘Brexit’’),
has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom, one of our
current markets, the EU and its remaining member states and may constitute an additional risk for the
financial markets and the European economy. Brexit could, among other outcomes, significantly disrupt
trade between the United Kingdom and the EU, cause political and economic instability in other countries
of the EU, including in our main markets such as Germany, Italy and Spain, contribute to instability in

49


-----

global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the euro and an increase
in cost pressure in the healthcare system resulting, for example, in price reduction of our products. Brexit
might also affect our ability to maintain the current level of sales in the United Kingdom, accounting for
A198.3 million, or 9% of our consolidated sales as of December 31, 2016. Given the lack of comparable
precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the Brexit will have and whether, and to
what extent, our business might be affected. In addition, the Scottish regional government is actively
considering a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom which may lead to
additional uncertainty and may affect our business activities in Scotland and other parts of the United
Kingdom.

**_Our sales and profits from generic pharmaceutical products may decline as a result of competition, both from other_**
**_pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental pricing pressure._**

Our generics products face intense competition. Prices of generics typically decline, especially as additional
generic pharmaceutical companies (including low-cost generic producers based in China and Vietnam)
receive approvals and enter the market for a given product and competition intensifies. Consequently, our
ability to sustain our sales and profitability on any given product over time is affected by the number of
new companies selling such product and the timing of their approvals.

In addition, intense pressure from government healthcare authorities, particularly in highly regulated
European markets, to reduce their expenditures on prescription drugs has resulted in lower
pharmaceutical pricing, causing decreases in sales and profits.

Furthermore, brand pharmaceutical companies continue to defend their products vigorously. For example,
brand companies often sell or license their own generic versions of their products, either directly or
through other generic pharmaceutical companies (so-called ‘‘authorized generics’’). No significant
regulatory approvals are required for authorized generics, and brand companies do not face any other
significant barriers to entry into such market. Brand pharmaceutical companies may also seek to delay
introductions of generic equivalents, by a variety of commercial and regulatory tactics (such as, obtaining
and enforcing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire, questioning the
quality and bioequivalence of generic pharmaceutical products, developing controlled-release or other
slightly modified versions, which often reduce demand for the generic version of the existing product for
which we are seeking approval, changing product claims and product labeling or developing and marketing
OTC versions of brand products that are about to face generic competition). These actions may increase
the costs and risks of our efforts to introduce generics products and may delay or prevent such introduction
altogether.

**_Our products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory_**
**_approval or limit their commercial potential._**

Although we disclose all known material side effects of our Generics and Branded products in leaflets
included in each product packaging, undesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could
cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt development, could result in the denial of
regulatory approval of our product, lead to potential products liability claims and could damage our brand
reputation.

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining the commercial success of our product
candidates, could substantially increase commercialization costs and, in general, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and reputation._**

Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal
counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the
Internet. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can potentially be life-threatening.
To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic
version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could
materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product, and harm the business of companies,
including ours, or lead to litigation. In addition, it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe
counterfeit products could mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. While we are not aware of

50


-----

any material cases in the past, if one of our products was the subject of counterfeits in the future, we could
incur substantial reputational and financial harm.

**_We commercialize some of our products under license from third party pharmaceutical companies._**

As at December 31, 2016, we commercialized certain of our products under license from a variety of
pharmaceutical companies. Our license agreements for in-licensed products typically provide that the
licensor shall manufacture such products for an initial term of several years and impose payment and other
material obligations on us. Although we believe that we currently comply with all of our material
obligations under these licenses, should we breach any such obligations, our counterparties may be entitled
to terminate the licenses. This may restrict, delay or eliminate our ability to continue commercializing
these in-licensed products, which could adversely affect our business.

Our failure to in-license new products or compounds for development and distribution, replace existing
products as needed or to retain our currently in-licensed products on a commercially reasonable basis, or
at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We may be unable to recruit and retain key personnel, including qualified scientific, technical and sales employees._**

We are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees, including our scientific, technical
and sales personnel. The loss of any senior manager or key employee may significantly delay or prevent the
achievement of our product development or business objectives. Due to the specialized scientific nature of
our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific,
technical and sales personnel. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key management, scientific,
technical or sales personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and financial condition. We
face competition for scientific and technical personnel from other companies, academic institutions,
government entities and other organization. Such competition is also enhanced by the reduction of
specialized personnel in certain key functional areas, such as in the case of engineers in Germany. In
addition, increasing demand for higher wages may make it difficult for us to retain the necessary personnel.

For example, on September 1, 2017, the Sponsors announced their intention to appoint Dr. Claudio
Albrecht as new chief executive officer and Mr. Mark Keatley as new chief financial officer of STADA.
However, STADA has not yet formally appointed these managers and there can be no assurance that
unforeseen circumstances will not prevent or delay their appointment. In addition, Dr. Albrecht is
expected to assume a non-executive role in due course, once a new CEO has been recruited on a more
long-term basis.

The loss of any key personnel or the inability to attract, recruit and retain highly skilled employees
required for our activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_A breakdown in our information technology systems could result in a significant disruption of our business._**

Our operations, including research, development, manufacturing, accounting, storage and delivery, are
highly dependent on our information technology systems. We make continuous investments to
appropriately adapt these complex and high-performing systems to changing business processes. Such
systems are vulnerable to a number of problems, such as software or hardware malfunctions, malicious
hacking, physical damage to vital data centers and computer virus infection. In addition, the information
technology system needs regular upgrading to accommodate expansion of our business and maintain the
efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in our system, we could experience significant business
and operational delays across our businesses. In particular, any breakdown in our information technology
systems could result in disruptions of our research, development, manufacturing, accounting and billing
processes. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our
data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the
development of our product candidates could be delayed. Any of this could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations
under the Notes.

**_We handle personal data including, to a minor extent, sensitive patient data in the ordinary course of our business,_**
**_and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that data could result in legal liability for us and reputational_**
**_harm to our business._**

We process sensitive personal consumer data (including, in certain instances, consumer names, addresses,
and to a minor extent, patient health data) as part of our business, and therefore we must comply with
strict data protection and privacy laws in all the jurisdictions in which we operate.

These laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our ability to collect and
use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, and could make us liable in the
event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. Unauthorized data
disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking,
malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, and physical security
breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access.

We and our customers and suppliers who carry out our outsourcing, have been in the past and could be in
the future subject to breaches of security by hackers. A future breach of our system or that of one of our
customers or outsourcing partners may subject us to material losses or liability, including fines, claims for
unauthorized use of personal and sensitive data or other claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity
breach could harm our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or
failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits,
result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or
regulations, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We have policies and procedures in place to seek to prevent such breaches and carry out detailed root
cause analysis on any breach that does occur in order to ensure that similar occurrences do not arise.
However, if a single material breach or series of less material breaches was to occur, we could face liability
under data protection laws, could lose the goodwill of our clients and could have our reputation damaged,
all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are exposed to default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of_**
**_contracting parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations._**

We are exposed to default and counterparty risks in connection with deliveries of our products and services
to customers or as a result of financing or hedging activities if contracting parties fail to meet their
obligations. In addition, there is the risk that, in a difficult economic and financial environment, national
healthcare systems may delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners, thus generating or
increasing default or counterparty risks. While we strive to maintain business relations with business
partners of good financial standing and we adopt suitable measures to safeguard us against default risk,
including guarantees, letters of credit, credit insurance or the transfer of assets, it cannot be ruled out that
these measures are insufficient. In addition, in certain developing markets, we rely on third party
distributors and other agents for marketing and distribution of products, who may have inadequate
internal compliance resources.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_The recent development of vaping products means the long-term health effects of vaping products use is not yet_**
**_understood by medical professionals._**

Our Branded Products portfolio features non-generic pharmaceutical products, including vaping products,
such as electronic cigarettes and vaporizers. These battery-powered products enable users to inhale
nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide and are marketed as alternatives to traditional
tobacco cigarettes and cigars. Although vaping products do not currently account for a material portion of
our sales, with respect to such products, we are exposed to long-term health related risks. Because vaping
products were recently developed, the medical profession has not had a sufficient period of time to study
the long-term health effects of vaping products use. As a result, it is unclear how safe vaping products are
for their intended use, or whether they may pose risks different from those posed by traditional cigarettes
and cigars. If the medical profession were to determine conclusively that vaping products usage poses
long-term health risks, vaping products usage could decline and we could be exposed to the risk of

52


-----

litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

We market our products in approximately 125 countries, have a direct presence in Europe, the MENA
region, Asia, South America and Australia, and operate 19 manufacturing facilities in ten countries.
Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are in currencies other than
the euro, our reporting currency, and as such our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and
transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the Russian ruble, the Serbian dinar,
the British pound sterling and, to a lesser degree, the Ukrainian hryvnia, Kazakhstani tenge, Vietnamese
dong and the Swiss franc.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our
functional currency. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate sales in another, any
change in the values of those non-euro currencies relative to euro could cause our profits to decrease or
our products to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and receivables
that are denominated in currencies other than the euro are greater or less than our liabilities denominated
in such non-euro currencies, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and movements in the foreign
exchange markets. Where we are unable to match sales and receivables denominated in foreign currencies
with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by
currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results of
operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies. For example, a currency
sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as of December 31, 2016,
showed that in the financial year 2016, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency compared
with the Russian ruble by 10% changed our EBITDA by approximately A1.8 million. At the same time, an
appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency in relation to the British pound sterling of 10%
would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately A0.6 million. Any of these factors could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

We generally employ different financial derivatives to counter the risks associated with assets, liabilities
and anticipated future cash flows denominated in foreign currency. However, to the extent that such
financial instruments are not sufficient or not effective or due to a default risk of the relevant counterparty,
fluctuations of local currencies could affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We may be exposed to transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities._**

We take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we
transfer and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a corporate
tax-transfer frame model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in
individual countries assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax-transfer pricing model and
address retroactive tax claims against one of our companies. While our tax-transfer pricing model has been
agreed between the competent authorities in certain countries, in others such model is still under
discussion with the authorities. There can be no assurances that our transfer prices will be accepted by all
the relevant authorities. If they fail to be accepted, this could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets may adversely affect our results of operations._**

Subject to certain conditions, we capitalize development expenses incurred in connection with the approval
process necessary to obtain marketing authorizations for our products and recognize such expenses as
intangible assets. In addition, as a consequence of our acquisition strategy, we regularly recognize
significant amounts of goodwill on our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2017, we had intangible assets of
A1,557.9 million of which A405.6 million related to goodwill.

All of our intangible assets are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets other than goodwill, or with a
finite useful life, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. At the end of each financial
year, and every interim accounting period, where there is any indication that an intangible asset may be

-----

impaired, its recoverable amount is calculated pursuant to impairment tests. We recognize the difference
between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount as impairment loss in the income statement. The
amount of impairment losses that we are required to recognize in the future may be significant, particularly
in the event of material acquisitions or products that perform below our expectations. See ‘‘—Our business
_could be adversely affected if we incur significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt-on acquisitions_
_or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions’’ and_ _‘‘Our ability to market our products successfully_
_depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by end-users, but also by independent third_
_parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists depending on the jurisdiction in which we_
_operate.’’_

The future development of the macroeconomic environment, unsuccessful acquisitions or other factors
could lead to possibly significant impairments to be recognized in the future, with potentially a material
adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Our business is subject to other operating risks, including natural disasters, sabotage, terrorism and other criminal_**
**_activities which may adversely affect our financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to risks normally incidental to manufacturing operations which may result in
work stoppages and/or damage to property. These risks include unexpected disruptions in infrastructure,
strikes, accidents, natural disasters, sabotage, criminal activities and terrorism. While we protect ourselves
against such risks to the extent possible and financially reasonable through appropriate insurance policies,
it could not be excluded that this protection will not be sufficient and that any of these events could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We may be exposed to the risk of deconsolidation if we do not comply with the requirements set forth in IFRS 10,_**
**_particularly with respect to our Vietnamese Joint Venture._**

We believe that we currently comply with the consolidation requirements of IFRS 10 ‘‘Consolidated
Financial Statements’’ in relation to control and consolidation of subsidiaries. If we failed to comply with
the consolidation requirements set forth by this standard, which could be due to capital constraints,
political or military conflicts, the absence of factual control over management or other barriers to our
control over subsidiaries, we would have to deconsolidate such subsidiaries. For example, one of our
subsidiaries, namely STADA Pharmaceutical (Asia) Ltd., has established the Vietnamese Joint Venture
with M.S.T. Commercial and Pharmaceutical Company Limited in Vietnam. Recent events may have called
our control over the Vietnamese Joint Venture into question. Due to an ongoing dispute with our joint
venture partner, which resulted in a pending lawsuit, and our current inability to obtain financial
information on our Vietnamese Joint Venture the deconsolidation of such joint venture in the near term
has become increasingly probable. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—STADA Vietnam
_J.V. Co. Ltd.’’ The effects of any deconsolidation will depend on the significance of the affected companies_
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our
ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect_**
**_our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments.
We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot be
certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax
positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to
pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect
such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Pending and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax_**
**_liabilities._**

The Target Group’s business activity is assessed for tax purposes based on currently applicable tax
legislation taking into account current case law and administrative interpretations. However, there may be
uncertainties regarding the tax treatment of specific transactions and we may contest taxes assessed against

54


-----

us. As a result, there can be no assurances that the Target Group’s current and future position on taxation
matters will be accepted by the relevant tax authorities. Such uncertainties in the applicable tax legislation
or case law, as well as any changes in interpretation by the tax authorities, could have a material adverse
effect on the Target Group’s net assets, financial condition and results of operations.

The Target Group is regularly subject to tax audits. While the Target Group believes that it has paid all
material tax liabilities and filed all material tax returns as of the date of this offering memorandum, and
made provisions that it believes to be adequate, with respect to material tax risks resulting from current or
past tax audits, there can be no assurances that no tax deficiency will be asserted against the Target Group
or that the taxes assessed by the competent authorities pursuant to such tax audits will not exceed such
provisions. All of the tax assessments issued for periods which were not yet finally audited may be subject
to review. Additionally, mergers and restructuring measures as well as the implementation of fiscal unities
(steuerliche Organschaften) may result in additional tax liabilities.

**_We could be adversely affected by changes to the composition of the Eurozone._**

If one or more countries in the Eurozone default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro,
there may be significant, extended and generalized dislocation in the financial markets and in the wider
European economy, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The departure of one or more countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of exchange rate
control laws. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more eurozone countries could
increase our exposure to changes in exchange rates and have negative effects on our existing relationships
with our suppliers or customers, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, or the threat of such
dissolution, could lead to increased market volatility, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our
business. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of
euro-denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro
would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments could adversely affect
our operations.

Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential re-introduction of individual
currencies within the Eurozone could also have adverse consequences for us. Financial markets and the
supply of credit may be negatively impacted by recent developments in Greece and fears surrounding the
sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe, the possibility of further downgrading
of or defaults on sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and
uncertainties regarding the overall stability and sustainability of the euro given the economic and political
circumstances in individual member states.

A deterioration in general economic conditions caused by instability in the Eurozone could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**Risks Relating to the Acquisition**

**_We do not, and may not in the future, own all of the outstanding common shares in the Target, and there can be no_**
**_assurance that a DPLTA will be approved and/or the Target’s shares will be delisted._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer directly or indirectly through
German Holdco holds 65% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares. Because the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer holds less than 90% of the Target’s shares and voting rights, the threshold necessary
to effect a squeeze-out under German law has not been reached as of the date of this offering
memorandum, and therefore a portion of the Target shares will be held by minority shareholders which
cannot be squeezed out, resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences for the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and German Holdco in connection therewith. As long as minority interests in the Target are
outstanding and no DPLTA has been agreed and registered, German Holdco, the Issuers and their
shareholders may be subject to limitations on their ability to enter into transactions with the Target that are
not on arms-length terms, which could limit efficiencies and cost savings that may otherwise be realized in
connection with the Acquisition. In addition, unless and until a DPLTA has been approved and registered,
there will be significant limitations and restrictions on the influence that the Issuers and German Holdco
may exercise as the direct and indirect shareholders of the Target (including with respect to compliance by
the Target and its subsidiaries with the covenants under the Indentures). As a result, there can be no
assurance that, prior to that, the Target and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise
have been prohibited by the covenants under the Indentures had those been applicable. See ‘‘—The Senior

55


-----

_Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the_
_Control Date.’’ Furthermore, we may be unable to, or the management of the Target may decide not to,_
delist the Target shares and, as a result, the Target Group may continue to incur costs as a public company.

On August 24, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer announced its intention to enter itself, or through
one of its affiliates, as dominating company into a DPLTA with the Target, as the dominated company.
According to section 293 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), entering into a DPLTA is
subject to the approval of at least 75% of the share capital represented at the shareholders’ meeting of the
dominated company approving such DPLTA. There can be no assurances that a definitive DPLTA will be
agreed and approved and neither the Senior Secured Notes Indenture nor the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement will contain any covenant requiring the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its
subsidiaries to take any efforts to implement or maintain a DPLTA.

In addition, a dominating company would be required to offer the Target’s minority shareholders the right
to sell their Target shares to the dominating company for adequate cash compensation or, alternatively, to
receive an annually recurring preferred dividend payment which must be guaranteed by the dominating
company. The adequacy of the amount of such compensation and guaranteed preferred dividend can and
usually is challenged by minority shareholders in appraisal proceedings, which can lead to an even higher
cash compensation and/or preferred dividend. The amount of preferred dividends may exceed such
minority shareholders’ pro rata share of the Target’s distributable profit and therefore adversely affect the
cash flows available to the dominating company and therefore impair the Issuers’ ability to service their
obligations under the Notes.

Unless and until a DPLTA has been registered, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco are
not able to create a fiscal unity and to consolidate the Target Group for tax and financial reporting
purposes and any proceeds the German Holdco may receive from the Target are limited to the dividend
payments approved by the Target’s annual general meeting. As a result, the absence of a DPLTA would
adversely affect the cash flows available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and therefore impair the
Issuers’ ability to service their obligations under the Notes as well as lead to potentially adverse tax
consequences for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group_**
**_until the Control Date._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer directly or indirectly through
German Holdco holds 65% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares. However, despite
holding a majority of the voting rights, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not obtain control of the
Target Group until the Control Date. As a result, the Issuers’ ability to influence the Target’s management
is limited. In particular:

- The Target’s Executive Board may not operate the business of the Target Group until the Control
Date in the same way that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Sponsors would.

- Much of the information contained in this offering memorandum relating to the Target had to be
derived from public sources and, in the case of certain additional information relating to the Target,
has been provided to the Issuers by the Target, and the Issuers have relied on such information that is
publicly available or was supplied to them in their preparation of this offering memorandum.

- The Transactions themselves have required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and
focus from the Target Group’s management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the
Target Group’s business. Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Transactions.

- In addition, the Target’s Executive Board will be required to manage the business of the Target under
its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of the Target. Only after the
implementation of the DPLTA will the Senior Secured Notes Issuer be able to indirectly direct the
Executive Board of the Target without consideration of other stakeholders and, particularly, minority
shareholders.

- Prior to the Control Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot assure you that the Target Group
will fully comply with the covenants described in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ to be included in the Indentures, due to statutory limitations on the
influence of shareholders on a public company. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date,

56


-----

the Target and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by
the Indentures had those covenants been applicable.

We cannot assure you that the Control Date will occur given it is dependent on the implementation of the
DPLTA, the Target being converted into a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter
_Haftung) or the implementation of a squeeze-out. If we are not able, or elect not, to implement the_
DPLTA, effect the conversion of the Target into a _Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung or effect a_
squeeze-out, then the Control Date will not occur.

Any of the risks associated with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s lack of control over the Target and its
subsidiaries until the occurrence of the Control Date could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

**_The Sponsors’ opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to the Target Group was limited, and their due_**
**_diligence may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with the Acquisition._**

Before making investments, the Sponsors conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable and
appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the due
diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of
an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that
may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When
conducting due diligence, the Sponsors typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax,
accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment.
Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence
process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due
diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsors rely on resources available to
them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third
party investigations.

Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or
corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in
certain jurisdictions.

There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations into the Target and its subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Following
the Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the Target and/or any of its subsidiaries that
adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with
applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial position and results of operations.

As the Target is a publicly listed company, the due diligence conducted for the Acquisition was mostly
limited to publicly available information. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due
diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other
illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the merits of
investing in the Target Group. We also cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence investigations
will result in the Issuers’ investment in the Target being successful or that the actual financial performance
of such investment will not fall short of the financial projections the Sponsors used when evaluating that
investment.

**_We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in the Acquisition._**

The Sponsors intend to implement certain operational efficiency and cost saving measures, as further
described under footnote (F) under ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—
_Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.’’ We may not be able to realize the anticipated_
efficiencies and savings targeted by these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we
currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect.

57


-----

Our estimated efficiency gains and costs savings are forward-looking and therefore subject to a number of
assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the underlying measures. Such
assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competition
risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions will turn out to be correct. In
addition, the estimated efficiency gains and cost savings may be offset by deterioration in the markets in
which the Target Group operates, increases in other expenses or challenges in the business unrelated to the
Transactions. As a result, the amount of efficiency gains and savings that we will actually realize and/or the
timing of any such realization may differ significantly (and may be significantly lower or later) from the
ones that we currently estimate and we may incur significant costs in realizing the Transactions and in
reaching the estimated gains and savings.

Failure to achieve the expected efficiency gains and savings may result in a lower return on investment for
the Acquisition, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_The Acquisition will entitle the Target Group’s customers and certain other business partners of the Target Group to_**
**_terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target
and its subsidiaries. For example, the Issuers have identified change of control provisions in certain leases,
as well as employment, customer, supplier and intellectual property agreements related to the Target
Group’s top ten products. These counterparties will be entitled to terminate their agreements with us.
Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial position and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, and_**
**_the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes will allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the Guarantors and the other Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over,
freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to
the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain
conditions, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral providers may,
among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and not all of the_**
**_Guarantors will initially guarantee the Senior Secured Notes._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 120 days after the Control Date (if such event occurs at all), the Senior
Secured Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only by a_
pledge of the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a pledge of the shares in the Target acquired by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Senior Notes Issuer, a security assignment of any structural
intercompany receivables owed by the Target to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and a pledge of the
material bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. We will agree in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture to take such necessary actions to secure the Senior Secured Notes on the earlier of (a) the
Control Date and (b) the date on which the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are first utilized by a member
of the Target Group and, in each case, substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, by first-priority security interests in pledges of the shares in, and material bank
accounts of and security assignments of structural intercompany receivables owed by each Post-Control
Date Guarantor to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Holdco. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens within the time periods specified, the failure of
which would result in an ‘‘event of default’’ under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The security
interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
otherwise as set forth under _‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests,’’ which limitations could be significant. See also_

58


-----

‘‘—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance
_and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability_
_of the Guarantees and the Collateral.’’ It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest granted by_
a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such
guarantee or security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws.
See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will only be guaranteed by German Holdco. We will agree in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to take such necessary
actions so that the Post-Control Date Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and
delivering to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee a supplemental indenture (or supplemental indentures)
substantially in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture on the earlier of (a) the date on
which such Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as
defined herein) and (b) 120 days from the earlier of (i) the Control Date and (ii) the date on which the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities are first utilized by a member of the Target Group and, in each case,
substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As of and for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, the Target and its subsidiaries organized in Germany, England and
Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland accounted for 40% of the
consolidated assets, 38% of the consolidated sales and 47% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target
Group. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional Guarantees
within the time period specified. The initial Notes Guarantees by German Holdco and the Notes
Guarantees of the Post-Control Date Guarantors will be limited as set forth in _‘‘Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.’’_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture_**
**_and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with_**
**_proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the
Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security
Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others, (following
the designation of the Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement) those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and
future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’)) in
priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event
of a foreclosure of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the
then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any
proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Senior Secured Notes Collateral will, after all obligations
under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied _pro rata in repayment of the Term_
Loan B Facility, Senior Secured Notes, (if the Revolving Credit Facility has not been designated as a super
senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility
and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior
Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively
subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees thereof are secured on a first-ranking
basis with security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that also secure our obligations under
the Super Senior Liabilities. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the Senior Secured Notes

59


-----

Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the
ability of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the
Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Company designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Designation Date’’), the Security Agent is not required to take
enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in
respect of indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain_
non-priority hedging obligations (the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Participations’’) which aggregate more than
50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured
Creditors’’) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease
enforcing the transaction security, then creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit
participations (or, in certain cases, creditor holding 50% of the total topco credit participations) may
instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at
that time (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance
with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent
the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months
of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the
Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within
three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the
Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may at any time provide
immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement
action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the
Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such
determination, in accordance with the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to
enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain
security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event
which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act
(i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation
Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance
with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that may in its
discretion require for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions until
it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes (such as indebtedness under the Term Loan B Facility), the voting interest of holders of Senior
Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we
incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous

60


-----

for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured
Notes Collateral consisting of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a
result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the
Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees may be released. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Security Release.’’

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the
Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior Secured Notes, you
will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Guarantors in the event of a default. See _‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.’’_

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that_**
**_has been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain_**
**_assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ Not all of our assets secure the Senior
Secured Notes, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture allows the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries to secure any future senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (which may be
structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees) with the property and assets of the
restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value of such assets and property
could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are
accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing
such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes.

While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and
grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or
creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture set out a
number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or
guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among
other things, the amount recoverable under any Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided being limited or
security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security
Principles may affect the value of the security or guarantees provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy_**
**_our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in
connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many
factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory
restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of
the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes,

-----

in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than
their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable
or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in
certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany and Russia, include restrictions on persons who
may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In
the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a
limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers.
Furthermore, entry into the security documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and
any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory
consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may
take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary
shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be
significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that
the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness
secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to
secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have
been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a
pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale.
In addition, the value of this Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes,
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders
of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not
permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties
may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised,
could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover,
if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such
Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Notes**

**_The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured debt incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and_**
**_its subsidiaries._**

The Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our present and future secured indebtedness to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior
Secured Notes, the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. In the event of our bankruptcy,
liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right
of payment to the Senior Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Senior Notes only after the
secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay
amounts due on any or all of the Senior Notes then outstanding. The Senior Notes Indenture will not
prohibit us from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from
incurring additional liabilities.

**_Your right to receive payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior debt of the_**
**_Guarantors._**

The obligations of the guarantors of the Senior Notes (the ‘‘Senior Notes Guarantors’’) under their
respective Senior Notes Guarantees will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in respect of senior debt of such Senior Notes
Guarantor. This senior debt includes the guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or in the case of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and the obligations under the
Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain

62


-----

restrictions on the ability of the Senior Notes Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt
incurred may be substantial and senior to the guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Senior Notes Guarantor in respect of an insolvency
event, the holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the
assets of such Senior Notes Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such guarantee. Until
the senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the
Senior Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor
Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor as their
interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Senior Notes Guarantor, holders of senior
debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in
respect of the Senior Notes Guarantor’s guarantee in respect thereof.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note
Guarantees provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the
benefit of the holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Senior Notes Guarantor has occurred and is
continuing, such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its guarantee until
such default is cured or waived;

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that permits
the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Senior Notes Trustee receives a notice of such
default, such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or
pursuant to its Note Guarantee, until (amongst others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such
default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

- that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Trustee are prohibited, without the prior
consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking
any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the
Senior Notes Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and
the Senior Note Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will
restrict the rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions
against each of the Senior Notes Guarantor and by accepting any Senior Note each such holder will be
deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes
will have limited remedies and recourse under the guarantees in the event of a default by the Senior Notes
Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor.

**_Security over the Senior Notes Collateral (other than the pledge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares) ranks behind_**
**_the security benefiting the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan B Facility and_**
**_the Revolving Credit Facility, and your rights to enforce your security over the Senior Notes Collateral are limited._**

The Senior Notes Collateral (other than the pledge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares) is pledged to the
Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Term
Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders of
the Senior Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents, the Senior Secured
Notes, Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility are secured by first-ranking security interests in
all of the Senior Notes Collateral (other than the pledge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares) and the
proceeds of any sale of Senior Notes Collateral (other than the pledge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s
shares) on enforcement will be applied first to repay all debt of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes,
the lenders under the Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations.
Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Senior Notes Collateral (other than the pledge over
the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares) because the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the
Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain hedging obligations
will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Senior Notes Collateral
(other than the pledge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares).

-----

**_The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral that has been granted_**
**_as security for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the_**
**_Senior Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral described in
this offering memorandum. See _‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Security.’’ The Senior Notes Collateral_
(other than the pledge over the Senior Notes Issuer’s shares) will also secure the Senior Secured Notes, the
Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility on a first-ranking basis, and may secure additional
debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. Although the
pledge over the shares of the Senior Notes Issuer secures the Senior Notes and the Guarantees thereof on
a first-priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Notes, the Term Loan B Facility and the
Revolving Credit Facility, such pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The
rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Senior Notes
Collateral or a reduction of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes. In addition, pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Senior Secured Collateral will be
applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the Designation Date has occurred),
followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) the Senior Secured Notes and any Lenders
under the Term Loan B Facility, among others, before repayment of the Senior Notes and Senior Notes
Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes exceed the value of the Senior
Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, those claims will generally
rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured debt ranking
_pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets_
pledged as Senior Notes Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes,
those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Notes, and
the Senior Notes Indenture will allow the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure
certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior Notes Indenture (which may be structurally
senior to the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted
subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an
event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Notes are accelerated, the Senior Notes and
the Senior Notes Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank
equally with the holders of other unsecured debt of the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior
Notes or such secured debt.

In addition, the Senior Notes Guarantees will be limited to the same extent as the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees which are expected to be granted by the Target and the other Post-Control Date Guarantors
under the Senior Secured Notes under certain conditions after the Issue Date and otherwise as set forth
under ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests,’’ which limitations could be significant. See also ‘‘—Risks Relating to Each_
_Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral.’’_

**_The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Notes, holders of the Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the
value of the Senior Notes Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Senior Notes and, in respect of the
Shared Issue Date Collateral, only after the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the
Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility have been paid in full. In the event of an enforcement
of the pledges in respect of the Senior Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the
pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior
Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the
Senior Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying
the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is
sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an
orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of
buyers.

64


-----

The shares and other Senior Notes Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of
the Senior Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of such
collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we
cannot assure you that the Senior Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be
substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we
operate, such as Germany and Russia, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses,
authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the
transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors
eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the
security documents, enforcement of the Senior Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may
require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might
otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be
obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur
and the value of the Senior Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not
secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Notes Collateral will not be sufficient
to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Senior Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of
our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have
limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s
shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged
must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors
secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the
proceeds of the Senior Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Notes,
the holders of the Senior Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Notes
Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Notes Issuer’s
assets and a subordinated, unsecured claim against the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Senior Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Senior Notes on the Senior Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other
indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior
Notes Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies
with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to
satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Notes under the
Senior Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the
holders of the Senior Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on
the Senior Notes Collateral.

**Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes**

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence_**
**_of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in_**
**_accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared
security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance
periods in particular, as the Indentures permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the
Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable
hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to
be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction,
it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.’’_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees thereof or the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral or the Senior Notes Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

Each Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of
those jurisdictions, and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any
of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
and the Senior Notes Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several
jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such
complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuers and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of
these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of
any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
guarantees and the security documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral will be granted to the_**
**_Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of each Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of
the Guarantors under the Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to
the respective Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to
enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising
under the security documents except through the relevant Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of
these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a
default. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but
require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty
under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are
not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions,
including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’)
mirroring the obligations of each Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture, as applicable
(‘‘Principal Obligations’’). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be
granted to the relevant Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure
the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at
all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in
respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the
security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security
interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except
through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or
bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested
under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly
granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not

66


-----

receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
or the Senior Notes Collateral. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Rights in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the_**
**_failure to perfect security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are
unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Under German law, the creation of a
valid security interest under a German law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain assets (such as
bank accounts) may be subject to the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or the security
provider to a third party (for example, the notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over
bank accounts). Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of
the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes
against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in
the same Collateral. The Trustees and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility
to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral or the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or_**
**_the Trustees or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral
securing the Notes will be released automatically, including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Senior
Secured Notes Collateral or the Senior Notes Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale
covenant of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Senior Notes Indenture, as applicable, and in
connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and Senior Notes Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted
subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and Senior Notes Indenture,
all of the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or Senior Notes Collateral owned by such subsidiary
and any guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes by such subsidiary will be released under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and Senior Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior
Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor,
obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of
the obligations secured by such security.

Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory
security interest created pursuant to a security document governed by German law might be released as a
matter of German law.

**_The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency_**
**_laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the_**
**_Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity_**
**_and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date or the Control Date, as applicable, our obligations under the relevant Notes
will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant
Collateral. The Issuers are organized under the laws of Germany and the Guarantors are organized under
the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There is a rebuttable presumption that the ‘‘centre of main interest’’ as defined in the Council of the
European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the
registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of
our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, the

67


-----

Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan
receivables held by the Issuers and certain of their subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Germany,
England and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the
Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuers’ subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability
of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests (as defined below). In
certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Guarantee if the company is
close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law,
although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the
relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security
Interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Issuers and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any
Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be
a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we
cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the
liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited
to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent
conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from
the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there
can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum
liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or Security Interest may be set
aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also _‘‘—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.’’_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests
created, the Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created
such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such
Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or Security Interest
knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or
Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit,
and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was
insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the

68


-----

Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about
to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were
unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to
make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or
created any Security Interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that both the Issuers and the Target Group are solvent, and will be so after giving
effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in
determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were
issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would
not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its
Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and
Security Interests, see _‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the_**
**_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The
Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Enforcement of the obligations under a
Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to
certain defenses available to the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and
defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and
Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws
of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant
Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral
exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would
be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general
statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

In relation to public limited liability companies (Aktiengesellschaften, ‘‘AG’’) strict German capital
maintenance rules as set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, ‘‘AktG’’) apply.
Guarantees and/or security interests provided by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to
guarantee or secure liabilities of any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company (such as the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer, as applicable) are, unless a specific exception applies,
considered disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of
guarantees and/or security interests by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose
of supporting the financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and,
therefore, invalid.

Investors should note that the Target, which together with the other Post-Control Date Guarantors, is
expected to provide a Guarantee and certain Collateral under the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes,
as applicable, after the Control Date under certain conditions set forth in the relevant Indentures, is
incorporated in Germany in the form of an AG.

69


-----

According to the wording of the law, both the prohibition of financial assistance as well as the capital
maintenance requirements described above are not applicable while a domination and/or profit and loss
pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag, ‘‘DPLTA’’) exists between the AG
and the shareholder on whose instructions the relevant guarantee and/or security interest is granted.
However, neither the Indentures nor the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will contain any
covenant requiring the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of their respective
subsidiaries to take any efforts to implement or maintain a DPLTA. Furthermore, even in case a DPLTA is
in place and provided that certain other requirements are met, the granting of guarantees and/or security
interests by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries (whether or not to support the acquisition of
such AG) may be considered to be in violation of the capital maintenance rules and financial assistance
restrictions, in which case such guarantees and security interests can be void, unenforceable, restricted
and/or subject to a redemption claim against the beneficiary. In particular, under the prevailing view in
German literature, the DPLTA exemption only applies if payments under the guarantee or enforcement of
the security interests, as applicable, do not cause the dominated entity (i.e., the AG) to incur a balance
sheet loss for which it cannot reasonably expect to be compensated for by the dominating entity due to the
financial condition of the dominating entity. Therefore, any Guarantees and/or Collateral provided by an
AG, including the Target and any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries will be subject to certain contractual
limitations (so called ‘‘limitation language’’) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other
document governing the Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure
compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws.
With respect to the DPLTA exemption, such contractual enforcement limitations will apply
notwithstanding the existence of a DPLTA if and to the extent the enforcement of the Guarantee and/or
Collateral, as applicable, provided by an AG, including the Target and/or any of its direct and indirect
subsidiaries will, or must expected to, result in an annual loss of the respective AG and such annual loss
would not be, or cannot expected to be, compensated for by a compensation claim under the DPLTA that
can be accounted for in the balance sheet of the Target at full (vollwertig).

Furthermore, guarantees provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Target) for purposes of guaranteeing the liabilities of the
Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes will be subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity
maintenance rules applicable to AGs and respective contractual enforcement restrictions set forth in the
‘‘AG limitation language’’ irrespective of the legal form of such subsidiaries given that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer is incorporated as an AG.

Also, guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschr¨ankter Haftung, ‘‘GmbH’’) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG)_
for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary
of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are
considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital
maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Guarantees and/or Collateral provided by
a GmbH, including by German Holdco, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called
‘‘limitation language’’) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other document under which any
Guarantee is granted) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with
applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. The pledge over
the Target shares is granted by German Holdco and will be subject to ‘‘limitation language.’’

In addition, any guarantee and/or security interest granted by an AG may be held invalid pursuant to
Section 138 of the German Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch, ‘‘BGB’’) and would therefore not be
enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest,
amongst others, the third-party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives
_Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the AG or other third-party creditors of the AG._

Similarly, any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to
Section 138 of the BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or
enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, amongst others, the third-party creditor and
the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of
the GmbH or other third-party creditors of the GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to
a GmbH & Co. KG.

As a result, the Target’s and any other Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Guarantee or
Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual

70


-----

enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Guarantee or
Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their
creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency
of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s
Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court
may determine that the Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any
limitations on the relevant Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of
such Guarantor or security provider. Future Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar
limitations.

See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be
offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in
offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable
laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors
in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in
very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of
Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered
holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing
on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will
make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest,
they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own
their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for
the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests,
they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

71


-----

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a
negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The
Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the
Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any
time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the
U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including depositors,_**
**_trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuers, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the
creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non Guarantor subsidiary of
the Issuers becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than
as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right
to proceed against the assets of such non Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the
assets of such subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as
applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non Guarantor subsidiaries of the
Issuers. In addition, the Indentures will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non Guarantor
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default
under the Indentures, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indentures will not contain any
limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by
these subsidiaries.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuers hold directly or indirectly 65% of the Target’s issued and outstanding
common shares. The effect of the minority interests of the Target (to the extent they continue to be held by
third parties and absent entry into a DPLTA) will be that the holders of such minority interests will share in
the proceeds from the sale or other disposal of assets of the Target before the Issuers or any Guarantor, to
the extent of their holding.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuers and the Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and their
business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the
Issuers and the Guarantors are non residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of,
the United States. Although the Issuers and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New
York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of
process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors.
In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and
those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable
to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the
U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

72


-----

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the Guarantors and the directors and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign
jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Germany, and
The Netherlands. For further information see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.’’

**_The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuers may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer,_**
**_even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the respective Indenture) occurs, the Issuers will be required to make
an offer to purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase. In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are
tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely
have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain
such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory
prepayment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future
indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to
purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indentures, which
would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may
not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indentures.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated
net leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the relevant Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the relevant Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes
that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to each other holder of Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption’’
_and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption.’’_

**_The term ‘‘all or substantially all’’ in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning under_**
**_relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of control has_**
**_occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the respective Indenture,
the relevant Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The
definition of ‘‘change of control’’ in the Indentures will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to
any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ it
has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of
the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the relevant Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the
potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time.
No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a
credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit
rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

Each of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, if at any
time following the date of each Indenture, the Notes issued under such Indenture receive an investment
grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB- or better by S&P, and no default or event of default
has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as such Notes are
no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to
such Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.’’ At any time when these covenants_
are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends
and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the interests of
holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes will ever
achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application has been made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’).
However, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuers cannot
maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuers may cease to make or maintain
such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the Notes on the Exchange does not
imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in the Channel Islands has been authorized. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange
or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing or the
delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an
adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks or other tax consequences as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in Euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the Notes
will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective
yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis.
Investing in the Notes by U.S. investors may have other significant tax consequences. See _‘‘Certain Tax_
_Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’_

**_The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of a series of Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or
greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes of such series will be considered to be
issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition
to the stated interest on the Notes, A U.S. Holder (as defined in ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations’’) will be required to include the OID on such note in gross income as it_
accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally in advance of

74


-----

the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’_

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

After completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total
financial indebtedness in the amount of A2,775 million, consisting of the Notes and the Term Loan B
Facility. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. See
_‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’_
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Issuers to satisfy their obligations with respect to the Notes, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating
rate of interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of
any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities.

**_The Issuers are holding companies that have no revenue generating operations of their own and will depend on cash_**
**_from the operating companies of the Target Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Issuers are holding companies with no business operations other than management of the equity
interests they hold in each of their respective subsidiaries. Following consummation of the Acquisition, the
Issuers will be dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or
other distributions or payments to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes and
the Guarantees. Given the Target Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating
subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our Group’s results. The amounts
of dividends and distributions available to the Issuers will depend on the profitability and cash flows of
their subsidiaries (primarily including the Target Group) and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to
declare dividends under applicable law. The Issuers’ subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not
be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuers to make
payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Secured Credit

75


-----

Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes limit the ability to upstream cash to the Senior Notes Issuer subject
to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable
law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or
distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the
Issuers’ subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers will generally be limited to the amount of distributable
reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. The Target is organized under
German law which provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable
reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law. The
subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with
respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees.

While the Indentures limit the ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including_**
**_the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability
to borrow up to A400 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, which will be secured by the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral, and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures also
permit the incurrence of additional debt thereunder. The Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from
security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be
structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the
Notes or secure the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Issuers’ and
their subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will not prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our
ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Due to restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry-forwards under applicable_**
**_law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

A certain amount of our annual financing expenses (primarily including interest payments) is not
deductible under existing interest limitation rules, especially the German interest barrier rules
(Zinsschranke) as further described below. Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier
rules impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. The German interest
barrier rules generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30%
of tax-adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same
fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business.
Any non-deductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject
to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years. Any interest carry-forward may be
forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures, such as a change of the ownership structure.
Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Target Group companies, in particular in Germany, may forfeit
their existing interest carry-forwards on the First Settlement Date. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the
European Council adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices
that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five
legally-binding anti-abuse measures, which all member states will be required to apply against common
forms of aggressive tax planning from January 1, 2017 onwards. Part of the package of measures is the
implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of
interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of
operations.

In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carry-forwards which have
partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax
loss carry-forwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be
forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such
restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or
voting rights transferred within a five-year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the
acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 25% of the
share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carry-forwards and current losses
will be forfeited on a pro rata basis while a transfer of more than 50% will result in total forfeiture. To the
extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set-off against future tax profits which
would result in increased future tax burdens. Such restriction may require a write-down of the deferred tax
assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and
results of operations.

The German Federal Constitutional Court, in a decision published May 12, 2017, has held that the
German tax loss forfeiture rules, in a version which was effective from January 1, 2008 to December 31,
2015, violate the German Constitution to the extent they stipulate a partial forfeiture of a company’s
current and carried-forward tax losses upon a transfer of more than 25% but less than 50% of its shares.
According to the decision, the German legislator is required to amend the current tax loss forfeiture rules
in respect of the aforementioned period and transfer of shares, so they are consistent with the German
Constitution.

Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss
carry-forwards and interest carry-forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a
subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for
the duration of the fiscal unity.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures contain covenants which impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other
things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ The_
covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs
and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under
certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See _‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’ Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Revolving_

77


-----

Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet
such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit
Facility, could result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon
the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect
to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the
relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and elect to declare
all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest,
immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including
our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of
our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In
addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not be_**
**_able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior
Credit Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion
plans, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is
subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’
many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to
fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then-outstanding amount under
the Senior Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Credit Facilities (including the Revolving Credit
Facility, which matures one year before the Senior Secured Notes and two years before the Senior Notes),
the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and
other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be
required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations
as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of
our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our
debt, including the Notes, the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, will limit, and any
future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be
at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further
restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any
assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the
amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these
efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Drawings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any future variable interest rate debt we incur in the future_**
**_will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash_**
**_flow._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
interest rates, primarily under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which are based on the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin.
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with
these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make
payments on the Notes. Neither our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures
contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of inter-bank lending rates,
regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are
conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of
daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate
EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates
and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international
regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into
force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration
of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted.
For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer
persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the
‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the
current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR
benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions
by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or
LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as
well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in
reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Bain Capital and Cinven indirectly own the majority of the shares of the Issuers. As a result, our
shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital
structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our
shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly
if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, the
shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business
of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly
or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary
to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our
shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the Target Group. Our
shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including
one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes
to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as
a holder of Notes.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On July 19, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a holding company controlled by Bain Capital and
Cinven, published the terms of a revised, all-cash voluntary public tender offer (freiwilliges
_¨Ubernahmeangebot) (the ‘‘Takeover Offer’’) for all common shares in STADA. Under the terms of the_
Takeover Offer, all shareholders of the Target (the ‘‘STADA shareholders’’) who accepted and tendered
their shares in the Takeover Offer received cash consideration equal to A66.25 per share (the ‘‘Offer
Price’’). At the time the Takeover Offer was announced, the Offer Price implied an equity value of the
Target equal to approximately A4.1 billion, plus the dividend in respect of the 2016 fiscal year, and an
enterprise value equal to approximately A5.3 billion. Following their analysis of the terms of the Takeover
Offer, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the Target declared their support for the Takeover
Offer and entered into an investment agreement, setting forth the principal terms and conditions of the
Acquisition and the Takeover Offer. The Takeover Offer was subject to certain conditions, including
acceptance by the holders of at least 63% of STADA’s issued and outstanding common shares (the
‘‘Minimum Acceptance Threshold’’) by the end of the initial acceptance period, which expired on
August 16, 2017. In accordance with German statutory law, STADA shareholders subsequently had the
opportunity to accept the Takeover Offer within an additional acceptance period, which expired on
September 1, 2017.

When the initial acceptance period expired, holders of approximately 64% of the Target’s issued and
outstanding common shares had accepted the Takeover Offer, and consequently the Minimum Acceptance
Threshold was satisfied. On August 22, 2017 (the ‘‘First Settlement Date’’), the first settlement under the
Takeover Offer occurred, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer acquired approximately 64% of the issued
and outstanding common shares in the Target. On August 25, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
incorporated German Holdco as its wholly owned subsidiary and contributed all of the Target shares held
by it as of this date to German Holdco. On September 1, 2017, the additional acceptance period expired,
with holders of approximately 0.1% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares having tendered
their shares during the additional acceptance period. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer acquired such
additional shares and also contributed them to German Holdco. On or about the First Settlement Date,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco have purchased, and may continue to purchase in the
future, additional Target shares in the open market or otherwise. Any such additional purchases of Target
shares have been, and may be in the future, financed with the proceeds from drawings under the Term
Loan B Facility and, on an interim basis, the Revolving Credit Facility.

STADA’s annual shareholders meeting (the ‘‘AGM’’) was held on August 30, 2017, and approved the
dividend in respect of the 2016 fiscal year. Any STADA shareholder that tendered its shares during the
initial acceptance period did not receive any dividend from the Target in respect of the 2016 fiscal year but
received the full Offer Price in cash from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Any shareholder that tendered
its shares during the additional acceptance period received A0.72 per share by way of a dividend from the
Target and A65.53 per share as residual Offer Price from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

As of June 30, 2017, the Target Group had Existing Debt with a book value of A1,432 million. A portion of
such Existing Debt in a principal amount equal to A1,380 million (and with a book value of A1,376 million
as of June 30, 2017) has become prepayable at the option of the holders and lenders in respect thereof, as
the Acquisition triggered their right to exercise a change of control put right at par within approximately
142 days following the First Settlement Date. The residual amount of Existing Debt with a book value of
A56 million, which does not provide for a change of control put right, is prepayable at STADA’s option. The
aggregate principal amount of Existing Debt that is prepayable at STADA’s option, including both
instruments with and without a change of control put right, is equal to A315 million (and a book value of
A315 million as of June 30, 2017). As a result, subject to the proportion of holders and lenders who exercise
their change of control put right and the amount STADA decides to refinance in its discretion, up to the
entire amount of the Existing Debt (with a book value of A1,432 million and an aggregate principal amount
A1,436 million) may be refinanced in connection with the Transactions. We may determine (or, prior to the
Control Date, the Executive Board may determine) that the Existing Debt at the Target should remain
outstanding and not be refinanced with drawings under the Term Loan B Facility or cash available to the
Target. Prior to the Control Date, any such Existing Debt at the Target that remains outstanding will be
structurally senior to the obligations under the Notes. After the Control Date, any remaining Existing Debt
at the Target may share in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral by operation of the negative pledges in
favor of the lenders under such Existing Debt. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

-----

The funding sources for the Acquisition, the repayment or refinancing of the Existing Debt, and related
fees and expenses consist of proceeds from the following sources:

- equity contributions from Bain Capital and Cinven in the form of equity and quasi equity (including
common and preferred equity instruments and deeply subordinated shareholder loans) totaling an
estimated A2,850 million, the proceeds of which have been or will be contributed to the Senior Notes
Issuer through intermediate holding companies (the ‘‘Equity Contributions’’);

- drawings by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate amount
of up to A1,700 million (equivalent) and the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of up to
A400 million;

- cash and cash equivalents of the Target Group, which, as of June 30, 2017, amounted to A321 million;
and

- drawings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility and the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility which
will be refinanced with the proceeds from the offering of the Notes. See ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisition and repay or refinance the
Existing Debt are shown in the table below. Both the funding sources described above and the sources and
uses shown below assume that we have acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares in the
Target and that all of the Existing Debt has been refinanced. To the extent that less than 100% of the
shares in the Target are acquired or less than all of the Existing Debt is refinanced in connection with the
Acquisition, the amount drawn under the Term Loan B Facility and the amount of the Equity Contribution
will be reduced proportionately. To the extent that shares in the Target are subsequently purchased in the
open market or otherwise at a price higher than the notional price of A74.40 per share assumed below, the
proportion of indebtedness and equity sources used to fund the purchase of shares will differ from that
presented below. The Term Loan B Facility will be available for drawing from August 17, 2017 to July 10,
2018, and, prior to the end of its availability period, any unutilized amounts thereunder may be drawn into
an escrow account for use after the availability period. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement—Overview and Structure—Availability.’’ Actual_
amounts will vary from the notional amounts presented here depending on several factors, including those
described above and differences from our estimates of fees and expenses.

(1) Represents an estimate of the Equity Contribution required to satisfy the uses based on the assumptions stated below which is
subject to change to the extent such assumptions change. As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Notes Issuer had received
Equity Contributions in the amount of A1,612 million.

(2) The drawings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility and Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility were initially used in connection
with the acquisition of Target shares on the First Settlement Date. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes and the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be used to refinance amounts drawn under the
Senior Secured Bridge Facility and Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, respectively. See ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

(3) Represents the gross proceeds from the Term Loan B Facility, subject to the assumptions stated below. The Term Loan B
Facility will be available for drawing until July 10, 2018, and, prior to the end of its availability period, any unutilized amounts
thereunder may be drawn into an escrow account for use after the availability period. The Term Loan B Facility includes a
euro-denominated tranche in an initial principal amount of A1,400 million, and A300 million (equivalent) as a pounds sterlingdenominated tranche. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement also provides for the Revolving Credit Facility in an
amount of A400 million and an uncommitted incremental facility. Utilizations of the Term Loan B Facility are subject to a
maximum leverage condition. The commitments under the Term Loan B Facility may be cancelled in part to the extent that less
than 100% of the Target shares are acquired or less than 100% of the Existing Debt is refinanced. As of September 22, 2017, the
Term Loan B Facility has been drawn in an amount of A250 million, and the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn in an
amount of A37 million. It is expected that within 35 days of the relevant drawings under the Revolving Credit Facilities,
A23.6 million of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will be refinanced with drawings under the Term Loan B
Facility and A4.4 million of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will be refinanced through a combination of

a drawing under the Term Loan B Facility and additional equity investments. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’_

(4) Represents a portion of the Senior Secured Notes deposited into a secured account for the purposes set forth under
footnote (1) to the table under ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

(5) Represents the Target’s cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2017, and assumes that such cash and cash equivalents will be
available to refinance the Existing Debt.

(6) Represents the aggregate purchase price for STADA’s 62,258,129 issued and outstanding common shares (giving effect to the
84,311 common shares currently being held in treasury) and assuming (i) a purchase price per share equal to the Offer Price in
respect of 64% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares and (ii) for illustrative purposes, a purchase price per
share equal to A74.40 in respect of the balance of issued and outstanding common shares. On September 3, 2017, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer announced that it would propose to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as part of the
negotiations of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (‘‘DPLTA’’) to offer STADA’s minority shareholders cash
compensation of A74.40 per share and to vote in favor of a DPLTA on such terms in any extraordinary general meeting of
STADA. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco also purchased 1.4% of the Target’s issued and outstanding
common shares in the open market as of September 22, 2017, and as of such date Senior Secured Notes Issuer holds directly or
indirectly 65% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares.

(7) Assumes that all of the Existing Debt will be refinanced at par in connection with the Acquisition.

(8) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing, including commitment, underwriting, arranging,
placement, original issue discount, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and
professional fees. These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this offering memorandum and are subject to
change. Refinancing costs exclude accrued but unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities to, but excluding, the Issue Date that will
be paid upon consummation of the Refinancing. Additional expenses in connection with Transactions other than the
Refinancing were paid by the Issuers and the Target and are excluded from this presentation. The Issuers funded such expenses
using proceeds from the Bridge Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equity Contributions.

(9) As of September 22, 2017, an amount equal to A7 million in aggregate was retained by the Issuers in connection with the
Acquisition. A portion of such amount will be used to pay refinancing costs in connection with the Refinancing. See ‘‘—The
_Refinancing.’’_

Prior to the Control Date, German Holdco has influence on the appointment and removal of Supervisory
Board members of the Target through the shareholder meeting. The Supervisory Board has the power to
appoint and remove the members of the Executive Board. Therefore, German Holdco has indirect
influence but will not have direct control over the Executive Board. The Executive Board will be required
prior to the Control Date to manage the Target under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the
best interests of the Target. As a result, pursuant to German statutory law, the majority shareholder may
not exercise its influence to cause the Target to undertake a measure disadvantageous to minority
shareholders unless this is permitted pursuant to German statutory law and compensation is paid to the
minority shareholders by the majority shareholder in accordance with German statutory law. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the_
_Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the Control Date.’’_

On August 24, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer announced that, following the settlement of the
Takeover Offer, it intends to enter into a DPLTA pursuant to Section 291(1) of the German Stock
Corporations Act (Aktiengesetz) between STADA as dominated company and profit transferor and the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or one of its affiliates as dominating company and profit transferee.

Under the DPLTA, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or one of its affiliates would be entitled to:

- instruct the Executive Board even if such instructions are not in the best interest of the Target (for
example, to cause the Target Group to grant upstream guarantees or transfer intellectual property and
to push down indebtedness into the Target Group); and

- receive 100% of the Target’s distributable profits in any year regardless of its shareholding in the
Target, provided that it also balances any annual losses of the Target.

Upon registration of a DPLTA, the dominating company will be required to offer to any minority
shareholders the election to either (i) put their shares in exchange for adequate compensation (the amount
of which is determined in accordance with German law) or (ii) receive a guaranteed annual payment (the
amount of which is determined in accordance with German law) from the dominating company. Both the
amount of the adequate compensation payment and the guaranteed annual payment may be contested by
minority shareholders in appraisal proceedings, though the DPLTA would still take effect regardless of
ongoing appraisal proceedings. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior Secured
_Notes Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the Control_
_Date.’’_

83


-----

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to de-list the Target shares in the medium-to longterm to the extent permitted by law.

Under German corporate law, implementation of a DPLTA requires approval by a supermajority of 75%
of the share capital represented at the shareholder meeting. As of September 22, 2017, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer holds directly or indirectly through German Holdco 65% of the Target’s issued and
outstanding common shares. On August 31, 2017, Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International L.P.
together with affiliated entities (‘‘Elliott’’) announced that Elliott would only support a DPLTA between
STADA and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries with all of Elliott’s current and
future Target shares if the compensation for minority shareholders pursuant to section 305 para 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) set forth in the published resolution proposal regarding such
agreement amounted to not less than A74.40 per share. See ‘‘Principal Shareholders.’’ There can be no
assurances that a DPLTA will be implemented, either at all or on the terms proposed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—We do not, and may not in the
_future, own all of the outstanding common shares in the Target, and there can be no assurance that a DPLTA_
_will be approved and/or the Target’s shares will be delisted.’’_

**The Refinancing**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Issuers entered into the Bridge Facilities Agreements, which
provide for the A485 million Senior Secured Bridge Facility and the A340 million Senior Unsecured Bridge
Facility. The Senior Notes Issuer loaned the proceeds of the Unsecured Bridge Facility to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer through an intercompany loan, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer used the
proceeds from such intercompany loan, the proceeds of the Senior Secured Bridge Facility, the Equity
Contributions from Bain Capital and Cinven and drawings under the Term Loan B Facility, to finance its
acquisition of the STADA shares offered pursuant to the Takeover Offer and to pay certain costs and
expenses in connection therewith.

A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the proceeds from the
offering of the Senior Notes will be used together with cash on hand at the Issuers to refinance amounts
that were incurred under the Bridge Facilities and to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the offering of the Notes, and a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes will be deposited into a secured account for future utilization, as described below.

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from
our estimates of fees and expenses. The presentation of sources and uses below excludes accrued but
unpaid interest on the Bridge Facilities to, but excluding, the Issue Date that will be paid upon
consummation of the Refinancing in an amount of A3 million.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes will be
A735 million and A340 million, respectively. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes and the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be used together with cash on
hand at the Issuers to refinance amounts that were incurred under the Bridge Facilities and to pay the
costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Notes, and a portion of the
proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes will be deposited into a secured account for future
utilization, as described below. See ‘‘The Transactions—The Refinancing.’’

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from
our estimates of fees and expenses. The presentation of sources and uses below excludes accrued but

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and the consolidated
capitalization (i) of the Target as of June 30, 2017, on a historical basis and (ii) of the Senior Notes Issuer
as adjusted to give effect to the completion of the Transactions (including the Offerings) and the
application of the proceeds therefrom as described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if they had occurred on June 30,
2017. This table is subject to the various assumptions regarding amounts as set forth under ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds.’’ In particular, it assumes that we have acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common_
shares in the Target and that all of the Existing Debt will be refinanced. To the extent that less than 100%
of the shares in the Target are acquired or less than all of the Existing Debt is refinanced in connection
with the Acquisition, the amount drawn under the Term Loan B Facility and the amount of the Equity
Contribution will be reduced proportionately, and the other amounts stated below may also be impacted.
The historical consolidated financial information has been derived from the Interim Financial Statements
of the Target prepared on the basis of IFRS included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All amounts
are shown excluding any capitalized deferred debt issuance costs.

You should read this table in conjunction with ‘‘The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Selected
_Consolidated Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations,’’ ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ and our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering_
memorandum.

(1) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents reflects the use of cash as set forth in ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ and assuming that all cash and
cash equivalents of the Target Group as of June 30, 2017, were used to repay Existing Debt, and does not give effect to any
increase or decrease of cash from operations since June 30, 2017.

(2) Represents the euro-equivalent of the indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility. Utilizations of the Term
Loan B Facility are subject to a maximum leverage condition; The commitments under the Term Loan B Facility may be
cancelled in part to the extent that less than 100% of the Target shares are acquired or less than 100% of the Existing Debt is
refinanced. As of September 22, 2017, the Term Loan B Facility has been drawn in an amount of A250 million and the Revolving
Credit Facility has been drawn in an amount of A37 million. It is expected that within 35 days of the relevant drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facilities, A23.6 million of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will be refinanced with
drawings under the Term Loan B Facility and A4.4 million of the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will be
refinanced through a combination of a drawing under the Term Loan B Facility and additional equity investments.

(3) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for a Revolving Credit Facility in an initial principal amount of
A400 million.

(4) In the adjusted column, assumes that all of the Existing Debt will be repaid in connection with the Transactions. As of June 30,
2017, the Target Group had Existing Debt with a book value of A1,432 million. A portion of such Existing Debt in a principal
amount equal to A1,380 million (and with a book value of A1,376 million as of June 30, 2017) has become prepayable at the
option of the holders and lenders in respect thereof, as the Acquisition triggered their right to exercise a change of control put
right at par within approximately 142 days following the First Settlement Date. The residual amount of Existing Debt with a
book value of A56 million, which does not provide for a change of control put right, is prepayable at STADA’s option. The
aggregate principal amount of Existing Debt that is prepayable at STADA’s option, including both instruments with and without
a change of control put right, is equal to A315 million (and a book value of A315 million as of June 30, 2017). As a result, subject

to the proportion of holders and lenders who exercise their change of control put right and the amount STADA decides to
refinance in its discretion, up to the entire amount of the Existing Debt (with a book value of A1,432 million and an aggregate
principal amount A1,436 million) may be refinanced in connection with the Transactions. We may determine (or, prior to the
Control Date, the Executive Board may determine) that the Existing Debt at the Target should remain outstanding and not be
refinanced with drawings under the Term Loan B Facility. Prior to the Control Date, any such Existing Debt that remains
outstanding will be structurally senior to the obligations under the Notes. After the Control Date, any remaining Existing Debt
may share in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral by operation of the negative pledges in favor of the lenders under such
Existing Debt. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

(5) In the historical column, consists of the sum of (i) share capital in an amount equal to A162 million, (ii) capital reserves in an
amount equal to A514 million and (iii) retained earnings in an amount equal to A764 million, net of (iv) provisions in an amount
equal to A409 million, (v) treasury shares in an amount equal to A1 million and (vi) minority interests in an amount equal to
A74 million. In the adjusted column, consists of the Sponsors’ Equity Contribution. To the extent that less than 100% of the
shares in the Target are acquired or less than all of the Existing Debt is refinanced in connection with the Acquisition, the
amount of the Equity Contribution will be reduced proportionately. As of September 22, 2017, the Sponsors have funded an
amount equal to A1,612 million under the Equity Contribution.

_Generics:_ Through our Generics segment, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost
alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in
our Generics segment require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and
hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with
competition driven by reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expiries of originator drugs
feed our product pipeline in the Generics segment, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and
local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics segment is
diversified, with the top ten products accounting for only 17% of sales in our Generics segment for the year
ended December 31, 2016. The top-five selling products (and their respective therapeutic areas) in our
Generics segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, were: Tilidine Naloxone (pain relief),
Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Pantoprazol (gastric ulcers/reflux), Epoetin zeta (anemia) and Diclofenac (pain
relief/inflammation). The largest countries by sales in our Generics segment for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Russia, France, Serbia and Vietnam. We generated
sales of A1,328 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A286 million in our Generics segment for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

_Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products segment primarily includes branded OTC products, which are
typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests,
cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands
include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-Go (Parkinson’s
disease). The market for products in our Branded Products segment is generally characterized by marketdriven pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty important factors for success.
Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top ten products accounting for only 31% of
sales in our Branded Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016. The top-five selling brands
(and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in
our Branded Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, were: APO-Go (Parkinson’s
disease, prescription required, available in 31 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in
29 countries), Snup (rhinitis, OTC, available in 18 countries), Fultium (vitamin D deficiency, OTC,
available in two countries) and Vitaprost (prostate disease, OTC, available in two countries). The largest
countries by sales in our Branded Products segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, were:
Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Vietnam. We generated sales of A920 million and
Management Adjusted EBITDA of A214 million in our Branded Products segment for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017.

**Our Reporting Segments**

Our segments transact business with each other in the ordinary course of their operations. In accordance
with transfer pricing rules, services between our segments are charged at market prices.

**_Operating Segments_**

We report our results of operations in two segments, Generics and Branded Products, which accounted for
59% and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated sales in the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

Products are assigned to each of our segments on the basis of our marketing strategy. Marketing of
generics is generally price-driven where we are dependent on reimbursements, and high product quality is
a necessary consequence of the stringent standards set by regulators. Where we determine that we are
competing in such an environment, and therefore mainly compete on the basis of price and our efficient
cost-structure, we classify products into the Generics business. This mostly applies to prescription products
which are most heavily regulated and generally reimbursable. Where we are free to set the price of our
products, we classify them into the Branded Products segment. This mostly applies to non-prescription
products which do not depend on reimbursements, but also to those of our prescription products that have
an established, highly-recognizable brand and significant customer loyalty or low levels of competition. Our
OTC products and medical devices are globally assigned to the Branded Products segment. Due to factors
such as differences in the prevailing regulation and reimbursement regimes, brand-recognition and
competition, the classification of our products may differ between countries. It may also vary over time due
to regulatory dynamics, with regulators re-designating prescription products as non-prescription products
or discontinuing reimbursement of prescription products. Re-designations are only effective for future
periods and never apply retroactively.

-----

Prior to mid-2016, we divided our operations into three operating segments, which, in addition to Generics
and Branded Products, also included a segment called Commercial Business which comprised the purchase
and subsequent sale of third-party products. In 2016, we decided to integrate the Commercial Business
segment into our Generics segment, which we believe achieves a clearer distinction, as each remaining
segment now operates with a similar range of products, sales methods and regulatory requirements. As a
result, our Commercial Business was reported as a separate segment in our Audited Financial Statements
for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 and our Interim Financial Statements for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, whereas its results were integrated into the Generics segment for any reporting
period ending after June 30, 2016.

**_Geographic Areas_**

We report our results of operations by country at the level of each segment. To provide a meaningful
breakdown covering the majority of sales in each segment, we report the eight largest countries in terms of
sales in the Generics segment and the five largest markets in the Branded Products segment. Sales are
allocated to the country in which the relevant customer is located. Prior to June 30, 2016, we reported our
results of operations based on four market regions, including Germany, Central Europe, CIS/Eastern
Europe and Asia/Pacific & MENA.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition include the following:

**_Regulation_**

Our industry is extensively regulated by a number of international and local regulatory authorities to
ensure that pharmaceutical products are effective and safe for use. Regulatory provisions typically require
us to obtain marketing authorizations before we are permitted to introduce new products into a market,
which drives our development costs. Other regulatory provisions establish high standards for the quality of
our products, services, raw materials, manufacturing and working conditions, which influence our cost of
sales, selling expenses and general and administrative expenses.

In addition, regulation significantly affects our pricing of products and profitability. In certain markets,
such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Serbia, the costs of prescription products are generally
eligible for reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs. However,
regulators set a reference price for each pharmaceutical ingredient or substance group, which is a price
limit that caps the amount government health programs will reimburse. Pricing regulation generally
benefits generics companies such as us compared to manufacturers of branded originator products.
However, regulators may decrease their reference prices from time to time, which especially impacted our
sales in Serbia and France during the periods under discussion.

Tenders are another cost-containment measure, primarily being employed by public institutions with
governments looking to source pharmaceuticals at the lowest price. Germany has a well-established public
tendering system covering the majority of generic sales, in which we have operated successfully during the
periods under discussion. Similar tender systems are operated in The Netherlands and Spain. In Italy, the
United Kingdom and Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions such as hospitals.

Cost-containment measures by regulators and governments may also result in the re-designation of
prescription products as OTC products or discontinuation of reimbursement for prescription products. We
believe that these measures play to our strengths, as end-consumers in need of pharmaceuticals that are no
longer reimbursable are more likely to prefer inexpensive generics such as our products over the costlier
originator products. Similarly, a reclassification of a prescription product into an OTC product means that
price regulations no longer apply, thereby creating the opportunity for us to leverage our brand recognition
to charge premium prices.

**_Volume Growth_**

We operate in a growing industry, which we believe influenced our sales during the periods under
discussion and represents a long-term trend. According to Quintiles IMS, sales in the global generics
market (top 50 countries) increased from A158.0 billion in 2014 to A171.9 billion in 2015 and A185.3 billion
in 2016, and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% from 2017 to 2021. Based on Quintiles IMS data, the

95


-----

major European generics markets (Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy) are expected
to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2017 to 2021.

We believe growth in the global pharmaceuticals market is being driven by long-term trends such as
population growth, aging societies, increased incidence of chronic disease, advances in medical therapies,
increasing self-medication and health awareness. Growth in the global generics market was additionally
driven by increasing generics penetration in the global pharmaceuticals markets, due to cost-containment
regulations incentivizing the use of generics to counteract the increasing cost pressure facing governmentsponsored health programs and recognizing that generics provide a high-quality and lower-cost alternative
to originator products. Another key driver behind the increasing generics penetration is a wave of patent
expiries.

In the generics space, we expect biosimilars to play an increasingly important role in the future, as they can
contribute significantly to cost control in the national healthcare markets. In 2015, the number of newly
expired patents on biologics in Germany exceeded newly expired patents on chemical-synthetic products
for the first time ever, which contributed to the significant increase in the global generics market from 2014
to 2015. In addition, it is estimated that twelve of the best-selling biologics in terms of sales will have lost
their patent protection by 2020.

We also expect regulators to continue the trend of reclassifying prescription into OTC therapies, thereby
stimulating growth in the self-payment and self-care markets. According to Quintiles IMS, the global OTC
market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2017 to 2021.

**_Economic Conditions_**

We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry which is generally regarded as a
non-cyclical industry. Non-cyclical industries are characterized by a low correlation between the demand
for their products, which are typically non-discretionary in nature, and fluctuations in general economic
conditions.

We believe that sales in our Generics segment, which mostly comprises non-discretionary prescription
products, are relatively independent of the economic conditions in our markets. As prices are mostly
regulated, frequently reimbursable by government or other health systems and with sales partly driven by
chronic diseases, volume demand in the Generics segment is relatively stable throughout the economic
cycle. However, the state of the local economy may encourage governments to initiate cost-containment
measures. Such measures may be favorable for us if they accelerate the transition from originator products
to generics or generics to branded OTC products, but they may be unfavorable where they lead to lower
reference prices. Spain, Belgium, France and Serbia are examples of countries in which we derived more
than 75% of our sales in 2016 from Generics.

However, the state of the economy impacts on our results of operations in our Branded Products segment,
which is mostly comprised of self-pay OTC products. The lack of reimbursement means that sales of OTC
products partly depend on consumers’ disposable income and general financial situation. A significant
portion of our Branded Products is non-discretionary, such as pain relievers, cough and cold medicines,
sunscreens and diagnostics. However, some of our Branded Products are lifestyle-driven and discretionary
in nature, such as cosmetics and vitamin supplements. Demand for these products is more susceptible to
fluctuations in the overall economy. Examples of countries in which Branded Products accounted for a
significant portion of our sales in 2016 include Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom including
through export sales into the United States (although APO-Go drives our Branded Products sales in the
United Kingdom and is a prescription product).

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

Due to our international business operations, we are subject to both foreign exchange transaction and
translation risk.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our
respective functional currency. We currently operate 19 manufacturing facilities in ten countries, and sell
our products in approximately 125 countries. As a result, a significant portion of our sales and our expenses
are denominated in non-euro currencies. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign
currencies with expenses paid in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency
exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that we are generally able to match sales with expenses incurred in

96


-----

the same currency, such that part of our foreign exchange transaction risk is naturally hedged. We also use
derivatives such as currency futures and swaps to mitigate foreign exchange risk.

We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, in the preparation of our Financial Statements
we must translate assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency
other than the euro into euro. Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates
may increase or decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, income and expenses, even if
their value has not changed in their local functional currency. For example, weakness in the Russian ruble
and the British pound sterling during the 2016 fiscal year adversely affected our results of operations
through foreign exchange translation losses, whereas a recovery in the Russian ruble in the first half of
2017 strengthened our results. Our principal exposure to translation effects relates to the Russian ruble,
Serbian dinar and British pound sterling and, to a lesser degree, the Ukrainian hryvnia, Kazakhstani tenge,
Vietnamese dong and the Swiss franc.

**_Acquisitions and Disposals_**

Selective bolt-on acquisitions are part of our strategy. We seek to leverage acquisitions to unlock internal
potential for organic growth, meaning that we typically acquire either companies that we can use as a
platform for our expansion into new geographic markets or product portfolios that we can roll out in our
numerous existing markets. Our focus in terms of acquisitions is on emerging markets that have shown
high growth in the past and Branded Products, as this segment is characterized by a lower degree of
regulation than Generics. Although we have completed several acquisitions and disposals during the
periods under discussion, no individual acquisition or disposition materially affected the comparability of
our results of operations.

**_Restructuring Expenses and Strategic Initiatives_**

Our results of operations are affected by special items and, in particular, restructuring expenses and costs
of strategic initiatives.

During the periods under discussion we have begun to reduce the complexity in our organization. We
reviewed our reporting and business segmentation and decided to integrate our commercial business into
our Generics segment, moved away from regional responsibilities and initiated a transition to centralized
management. We also consolidated certain entities to realize synergies, for example in Germany. We have
started to streamline our product portfolio, which resulted in the discontinuation of smaller volume SKUs
and write-offs on certain intangible assets. Additionally, we are reviewing our business processes with the
aim of increasing automation, centralization and harmonization across our international operations. We
also negotiated with some of our suppliers of finished goods and were able to exact better terms.

The centralization of our management structure was designed to improve our portfolio strategy and
facilitate the further internationalization of our Branded Products.

**_Seasonality_**

To a certain degree, our results of operations are affected by seasonality. For example, the results of our
Branded Products segment typically fluctuate in line with the magnitude and timing of the cough and cold
season which drives sales of our cold medicines such as Grippostad, Covonia, Aqualor, Snup and
antibiotics in the fourth and first quarter of each year. In a similar vein, the summer weather in the second
and third quarter influences our sales of sunscreen products such as Ladival. Our marketing expenses are
subject to the same seasonal drivers.

**_New Product Launches_**

Our sales are impacted by the number of product launches in each year. Particularly in our large and
mature markets product launches can be a key driver behind sales growth, as was the case especially in
Germany and Spain during the periods under discussion. Most of our product launches relate to new
Generics. Because Generics are not usually broadly advertised, these product launches have no material
impact on our marketing expenses. In our Branded Products segment, however, our marketing expenses
correlate with the number of product launches, as the introduction of a new product is typically
accompanied by extensive marketing campaigns. When we launched our successful and fast-growing
sleeping aid Hoggar Night, for example, we incurred significant marketing expenses for a TV advertising
campaign.

97


-----

We launched 665, 578 and 626 products in the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The number of
marketable products that we are able to launch in any year is partly driven by regulation and the
availability of new products and thus partly outside our control.

**Explanation of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a description of the key line items presented in our Financial Statements. Our key line
items are reported on the basis of uniform accounting policies that are implemented at each entity within
the Target Group’s scope of consolidation.

**_Sales_**

Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered, provided that it is probable that
measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that the significant risks and rewards of ownership
have been transferred to the buyer. It must also be possible to reliably measure the company’s own costs
incurred or to be incurred. Sales are recognized before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions
(rebates or discounts) at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Expenses due to provisions
for warranties are deducted from sales on the basis of estimates which are based on past experience
expressed as a percentage of sales. Discounts granted to health insurance systems are recognized as a
reduction of sales, based on the relevant contract. Income and expenses from the same transactions are
generally recorded in the same period. Expenses related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus
recorded in the period in which the sales are realized.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales includes the costs of raw material inputs and their conversion into marketable products,
including the directly associated personnel expenses, as well as depreciation charges related to the relevant
production equipment. In addition, cost of sales includes valuation allowances for excess or obsolete
inventories and the purchase price of commercial goods sold or provided free of charge. Cost of sales also
includes amortization charges against intangible assets recognized in connection with drug approvals. Cost
of sales are recognized in the same period in which the associated income is realized.

**_Selling Expenses_**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and sales force, selling expenses also comprises the costs for
advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. Selling expenses also includes all costs
for the distribution of our products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, which are referred to as
discounts in kind, are not included in selling expenses but in cost of sales.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research expenses are costs that are incurred in relation to research activity aimed at new scientific or
technical findings. We only engage in a limited amount of proprietary research for new active
pharmaceutical ingredients and our product portfolio is focused in products that do not require
proprietary research. As a result, we typically do not incur material research expenses.

Development costs are costs that result from the technical implementation of theoretical discoveries in
production and production processes and facilitate their commercial implementation. As a rule, it is the
objective of our drug development process to obtain national or multinational marketing authorizations for
our products, to capitalize all development costs incurred in relation to these authorizations and recognize
them as intangible assets. As described above under ‘‘—Cost of Sales,’’ we then amortize these intangible
assets as part of cost of sales. Whenever development costs do not satisfy the requirements for
capitalization, we expense them in the periods in which they are incurred and report them under the line
item development costs. Costs related to the development of new products are usually capitalized, whereas
costs for technical and regulatory maintenance or optimization of existing products are usually expensed as
development costs.

98


-----

Development costs must satisfy the following criteria in order to be capitalized: (i) it is technically possible
for the relevant product to become marketable or otherwise available for use in our business in the future
(which generally equates to the grant of a marketing authorization); (ii) we have the intention and ability,
as well as the necessary resources, to achieve marketability or utility of the relevant product; (iii) it is
probable that the future economic benefits accruing from the intangible asset will flow to the Target
Group; and (iv) the cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably.

**_Other Income_**

Other income primarily includes reversals of impairment losses and other write-ups on non-current assets
(excluding goodwill), income from asset disposals, income from insurance compensation, income from
indemnification payments as well as remaining other income not directly associated with functional costs.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other expenses primarily includes bad debt expenses, currency translation expenses, impairment losses on
non-current assets, and certain taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to our sales, administration or
research and development functions.

**_Financial Result_**

Financial result is the net of financial income and financial expenses. Financial income primarily includes
interest income, distributions received from investments accounted for using the equity method and
income from the measurement of financial instruments. Financial expenses are mainly composed of
interest expense and expenses from the measurement of derivative financial instruments.

**_Income Taxes_**

The item income taxes includes taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as
well as deferred taxes. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to our sales, administration or
research and development functions are included in other expenses.

Sales increased by A108.5 million, or 10%, to A1,143.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from
A1,034.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Over the same period, adjusted sales increased by
A64.0 million, or 6%, to A1,096.4 million from A1,032.4 million. Our adjustment to sales accounts for
currency effects and portfolio changes. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted sales to
reported sales for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as well as comparative information for the previous

(2) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the
comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in
each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period.

(3) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and
divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by
products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

The adjustment in respect of currency effects decreased sales in the six months ended June 30, 2017, by
A20.1 million. The adjustment primarily reflects the appreciation of the Russian ruble against the euro,
which was partly offset by the depreciation of the British pound sterling.

The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes decreased sales in the six months ended June 30, 2017, by
A26.8 million. The adjustment primarily removes the impact on sales of our acquisitions of Velexfarm in
Serbia and Natures Aid in the United Kingdom.

_Constant-Currency Sales_

Constant-currency sales increased by A89.7 million, or 9%, to A1,122.8 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, from A1,033.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016.

_Sales by Operating Segment_

Generics

Reported sales in our Generics segment increased by A47.2 million, or 8%, to A674.4 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, from A627.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was
primarily due to the contribution of our Serbian subsidiary Velexfarm d.o.o., which we acquired in the first
quarter of 2017. Additionally, the increase was due to higher segment sales in Italy and Belgium, with the
latter driven by higher volumes resulting from the insourcing of our sales activities in Belgium in January
2017, following the termination of the distribution agreement (the ‘‘Omega Distribution Agreement’’) with
our former Belgian distribution partner, Omega Pharma N.V., in December 2016. Over the same period,
adjusted sales in the Generics segment increased by A23.4 million, or 4%, to A648.3 million, from
A624.9 million, primarily due to better sales performance in Belgium and Italy. Generics accounted for
59% of reported sales in the six months ended June 30, 2017, representing a decrease from 61% in the
previous period. Our top five active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales of A63.8 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2017, or 9.5% of total sales in the Generics segment, compared to A65.2 million,
or 10%, in the six months ended June 30, 2016. With sales of A17.8 million, a decrease of A4.8 million, or
21%, from A22.6 million in the previous period, Tilidine Naloxone was the best-selling active
pharmaceutical ingredient in the Generics segment in the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Branded Products

Reported sales in our Branded Products segment increased by A61.5 million, or 15%, to A468.8 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2017, from A407.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This
increase was primarily due to our improved performance in the Russian market, as well as stronger sales in
the Serbian market. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the Branded Products segment increased by
A40.8 million, or 10%, to A448.1 million, from A407.3 million. Branded Products accounted for 41% of
reported sales in six months ended June 30, 2017, representing an increase from 39% in the previous
period. Our top five Branded Products accounted for sales of A110.0 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, or 23.5% of sales in the Branded Products segment, compared to A86.8 million, or 21%, in
the six months ended June 30, 2016.

**Total Branded Products segment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **468.8** **407.3** **15%**

Germany

Sales in Germany decreased by A13.4 million, or 5%, to A237.3 million in the six months ended June 30,
2017, from A250.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Generics accounted for A145.9 million of
sales in Germany, or 62%, compared to A150.5 million, or 60%, in the previous period. This decrease was
primarily due to the expiration of discount agreements (Rabattvertr¨age) between STADApharm and social
health insurance schemes in December 2016 and the particularly strong performance in the previous
period. Branded Products accounted for A91.4 million of sales in Germany, or 38%, compared to
A100.2 million, or 40%, in the previous period. This decrease was primarily due to reporting date effects in
connection with annual orders (Jahresauftr¨age), which provide for the delivery of a specified product
volume spread out over the course of an entire year. Annual orders leave room for discretion of the
supplier as to the timing of individual deliveries. In 2016, STADA GmbH delivered the bulk of such annual
orders in the first half of the year, whereas in 2017 we expect the delivery of such orders to be evenly
distributed across the year.

Russia

Sales in the Russian Federation increased by A50.8 million, or 46%, to A160.3 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2017, from A109.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. On a constant currency
basis, sales of Generics decreased by 13% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the previous
period, primarily due to lower volumes. On an actual basis, sales of Generics increased by 6% to
A52.3 million from A49.3 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble against the euro.
Generics accounted for 33% of sales in Russia, compared to 45% in the previous period. On a constant
currency basis, sales in our Branded Products segment increased by 48% in the six months ended June 30,
2017 compared to the previous period. On an actual basis, sales of Branded Products increased by 80% to
A108.0 million from A60.2 million in the previous period. This increase was primarily driven by higher
volumes and also by favorable foreign exchange translation effects. Branded Products accounted for 67%
of sales in Russia, compared to 55% in the previous period.

United Kingdom

On a constant currency basis, sales of Branded Products in the United Kingdom increased by 8% in the six
months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the previous period. On an actual basis, sales of Branded
Products decreased by 2% to A82.1 million from A83.6 million, primarily due to a weak cough and cold
season in the first six months of 2017 as well as negative currency effects resulting from the United
Kingdom’s referendum decision to leave the European Union. Branded Products accounted for 86% of
total sales in the UK market in the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to 89% in the six months
ended June 30, 2016. Generics accounted for the balance of our sales in the period.

Italy

Sales in Italy increased by A5.1 million, or 5%, to A106.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
from A101.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Over the same period, sales of Generics in Italy
increased by 6% to A84.8 million, from A79.8 million in the previous period. Generics accounted for 80% of
our sales in Italy in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 79% in the six months ended June 30,
2016. Sales of Branded Products in Italy remained relatively stable at A21.6 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017 compared to A21.5 million in the previous period. Branded Products accounted for 20% of
our sales in Italy in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 21% in the six months ended June 30,
2016.

Spain

Sales of Generics in Spain remained relatively stable at A53.0 million in the six months ended June 30,
2017, compared to A52.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Generics accounted for 83% of our
sales in Spain, compared to 85% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Branded Products accounted for
the balance of our sales in the period.

Belgium

In Belgium, sales of Generics increased by A15.2 million, or 37%, to A56.0 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, from A40.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due higher volumes
resulting from the insourcing of our sales activities in January 2017, following the termination of our
Omega Distribution Agreement. Over the same period, Generics accounted for 90% of our Belgian sales,
compared to 88% in the previous period. Branded Products accounted for the balance of our sales in the
period.

France

In France, sales of Generics decreased by A1.7 million, or 4%, to A38.7 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, from A40.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due
to the market’s strong and continued price-based and discount-based competition. Over the same period,
Generics accounted for 93% of our sales in France, which represents a slight decrease from 96% in the
previous period. Branded Products accounted for the balance of our sales in the period.

Vietnam

Sales in Vietnam increased by A4.5 million, or 9%, to A54.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
from A49.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. On a constant currency basis, sales of Generics
increased by 7% compared to the previous period. On an actual basis, sales of Generics in Vietnam
increased by 8% to A35.1 million from A32.4 million in the previous period. This increase was primarily due
to new sales contracts we won in tenders within the local hospital market. Over the same period, Generics
accounted for 64% of sales in Vietnam, relatively stable compared to 65% in the previous period. Sales
from Branded Products increased by 9% on a constant currency basis in the six months ended June 30,
2017 compared to the previous period. On an actual basis, sales increased by 10% to A19.4 million from
A17.5 million in the previous period. Branded Products accounted for 36% of overall sales in Vietnam,
relatively stable compared to 35% in the previous period.

Serbia

Our sales of Generics in Serbia, on a constant currency basis, increased by A18.5 million, or 72%, to
A44.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from A25.6 million in the six months ended June 30,

104


-----

2016. On an actual basis, sales increased by A18.4 million, or 72%, to A44.0 million from A25.6 million in
the previous period. This increase was primarily due to the sales contribution from our newly-acquired
Serbian subsidiary Velexfarm, which became a consolidated subsidiary as of January 2017. In addition, the
increase was driven by our adoption of a new distribution model in the Serbian Generics market, under
which our Serbian operations will increasingly focus on direct sales rather than through wholesalers. Over
the same period, Generics accounted for 81% of sales in Serbia, which represents an increase compared to
76% in the previous period. Branded Products accounted for the balance of our sales in the period.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales increased by A46.5 million, or 9%, to A575.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
from A529.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was proportionally lower than the
increased sales, particularly due to an exchange-rate related improvement in purchasing conditions in the
CIS subgroup.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Selling expenses increased by A10.7 million, or 5%, to A243.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
from A232.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased
marketing and sales expenses in the Branded Products segment, particularly in Russia, the United
Kingdom and Italy.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

General and administrative expenses increased by A7.8 million, or 9%, to A98.5 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2017, from A90.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and, as a percentage of
consolidated sales, decreased slightly to 8.6% from 8.8% due to various management consulting expenses
in connection with ongoing operational improvements.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research and development expenses increased by A2.2 million, or 7%, to A33.2 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2017, from A31.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016.

**_Other Income_**

Other income increased by A3.3 million, or 40%, to A11.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017,
from A8.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to write-ups on
non-current assets in the Branded Products segment.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other expenses increased by A41.6 million to A64.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from
A22.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased writedowns on non-current assets in the Branded Products segment, of which Fultium-D3 vitamin drops are the
largest single item, as well as an increase in consulting expenses in connection with the Acquisition and
write-downs on trade accounts receivable.

**_Financial Result_**

Financial result decreased by A5.8 million, or 23%, to a loss of A19.2 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, from a loss of A25.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was
primarily due to lower expenses from the measurement of derivative financial instruments and lower
interest expenses.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes increased by A0.2 million, or 1%, to A24.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from
A24.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Our reported tax rate decreased to 20.7% from 22.2%
in the previous period, mainly due to the reversal of tax provisions in relation to, among other things, an
agreement between two tax authorities in respect of transfer pricing positions.

Overall, our results of operations in the six months ended June 30, 2017, benefitted from positive trends in
the Belgian Generics segment and the Russian Branded Products segment. However, special items (such as
consulting expenses related to the Acquisition) in an amount of A17.1 million before taxes and
A12.3 million after taxes were recorded in the first half of 2017 and negatively affected our key earnings
figures in the first six months of 2017; see the discussion of ‘‘—Special Items’’ below.

_Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit increased by A3.1 million, or 2%, to A139.4 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2017, from A136.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Due to adjustments for special
items, adjusted operating profit increased by 19% to A183.4 million from A153.6 million in the previous
period.

Reported operating profit in the Generics segment increased by A18.0 million, or 17%, to A122.6 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2017, from A104.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This
increase was primarily due to higher operating profit in Belgium, following our termination of the Omega
Distribution Agreement in December 2016 as well as higher operating profit in the German Generics
segment. Adjusted operating profit in the Generics segment increased by 18% to A124.4 million from
A105.6 million in the previous period. The adjusted operating profit margin of Generics was 18.4%,
compared to 16.8% in the previous period. The reported operating profit margin in our Generics segment
was 18.2%, compared to 16.7% in the previous period.

Reported operating profit in the Branded Products segment increased by A2.1 million, or 3%, to
A72.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from A70.7 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016. This increase was primarily due to strong sales and positive translation effects in Russia as well as the
higher earnings contribution from our Serbian subgroup due to the integration of a consumer health
product portfolio acquired in the third quarter of 2016 and the associated improvement of our market
position. Adjusted operating profit in the Branded Products segment increased by 10% to A97.7 million
from A88.7 million in the previous period. This increase was also due to the aforementioned drivers of
reported operating profit. The adjusted operating profit margin of Branded Products was 20.8%,
compared to 21.8% in the previous period. The reported operating profit margin of our Branded Products
segment was 15.5%, compared to 17.4% in the previous period.

_Net Income, Adjusted Net Income_

Reported net income increased by A8.3 million, or 10%, to A90.3 million in the six months ended June 30,
2017, from A82.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Due to adjustments for special items,
adjusted net income increased by A18.0 million, or 19%, to A114.1 million from A96.1 million in the
previous period.

_EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by A20.2 million, or 10%, to A220.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from
A200.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Due to adjustments for special items, Management
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 18% to A237.7 million from A202.3 million in the previous period.

EBITDA in our Generics segment increased by A21.7 million, or 17%, to A151.0 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2017, from A129.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was due to
the drivers described in the discussion of operating profit above. The EBITDA margin in Generics was
22.4%, compared to 20.6% in the previous period. Management Adjusted EBITDA in our Generics
segment increased by 16% to A150.7 million from A129.6 million in the previous period. This increase in
Management Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the improved performance in Belgium and Germany
described in the discussion of operating profit above. The Management Adjusted EBITDA margin in our
Generics segment was 22.3%, compared to 20.7% in the previous period.

EBITDA in our Branded Products segment increased by A16.8 million, or 16%, to A121.5 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, from A104.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was
due to the drivers described in the discussion of operating profit above. The EBITDA margin of Branded
Products was 25.9%, compared to 25.7% in the previous period. Management Adjusted EBITDA in our
Branded Products segment increased by 12% to A121.4 million from A108.6 million in the previous period.
This increase was mainly due to the drivers described in the discussion of operating profit above. The

**_Special Items_**

When adjusting for special items, earnings before taxes would have been higher by A44.0 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, compared to our reported results for the six months ended June 30, 2017.

The following tables provide an overview of our special items and their impact on certain line items for the

allocations as well as measurement effects. Taking as a basis the levels in 2013, this adjustment adds back additional scheduled
depreciation and other measurement effects due to purchase price allocations as well as significant product acquisitions.

2017, STADA has discontinued this adjustment in its reporting, as it believes the significant fluctuations experienced in more
recent periods have returned to a more normal level.

A2,115.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Over the same period, adjusted sales increased by
A66.8 million, or 3%, to A2,167.2 million from A2,100.4 million. Our adjustment to sales accounts for
currency effects and portfolio changes. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted sales to

(2) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the
comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in
each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period.

(3) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and
divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by
products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

The adjustment in respect of currency effects increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 by
A69.6 million. The amount of the adjustment was primarily due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble,
British pound sterling and Serbian dinar against the euro. While the Russian ruble was weaker in light of a
depressed economic environment, the British pound sterling decreased significantly compared to the euro
in the wake of the referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit). The Serbian dinar depreciated only
slightly against the euro during 2016, while the Ukrainian hryvnia, Kazakhstani tenge, Vietnamese dong
and Swiss franc were all markedly weaker. Foreign exchange translation effects in relation to other
currencies only had a minor impact on our sales.

The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes decreased sales by A41.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of the Socialites group and Laboratorio Vannier. In
the year ended December 31, 2015, the adjustment in respect of portfolio changes decreased sales by
A14.7 million, including the retrospective adjustment, primarily due to the disposal of Laboratoires
d’etudes et de recherches en oligo elements therapie SA and the suspension of the commercial business
within STADA Nordic.

_Constant-Currency Sales_

Constant-currency sales increased by A83.6 million, or 4%, to A2,133.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, from A2,049.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Sales by Operating Segment_

Generics

Reported sales in our Generics segment increased by A19.3 million, or 2%, to A1,280.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016, from A1,261.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily due to higher sales in Italy, Russia and Vietnam. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the
Generics segment increased by A34.2 million, or 3%, to A1,287.4 million, from A1,253.2 million. The greater
increase compared to reported sales is mainly due to the elimination of adverse foreign currently exchange
effects. Generics accounted for 59.9% of consolidated sales in 2016, relatively stable compared to 59.7% in
the previous year. Our top five active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales of A133.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2016, or 10.4% of total sales in the Generics segment, compared to
A117.9 million, or 9.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2015. With sales of A43.6 million, an increase of
A11.6 million, or 36%, from A32.0 million in the previous year, Tilidine Naloxone was the best-selling active
pharmaceutical ingredient in the Generics segment in 2016.

Branded Products

Reported sales in our Branded Products segment increased slightly by A4.9 million, or 1%, to
A858.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from A853.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. This increase was driven by a strong sales performance in Germany and inorganic sales growth in the
United Kingdom due to acquisitions, which were almost entirely offset by declining sales in Russia. Over
the same period, adjusted sales in the Branded Products segment increased by 4% to A879.8 million in 2016
from A847.1 million in 2015, with the majority of the adjustment being driven by foreign currency exchange
effects. Branded products accounted for 40.1% of consolidated sales in 2016, relatively constant compared
to 40.3% of consolidated sales in the previous year. Our top five Branded Products accounted for sales of
A177.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, or 20.6% of sales in the Branded Products segment,
compared to A199.7 million, or 23.4% of sales of Branded Products, in the year ended December 31, 2015.

Germany

Sales in Germany increased by A48.8 million, or 11%, to A485.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2016, from A436.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Generics accounted for A308.0 million of
sales in Germany, or 63% of overall German sales, compared to A308.3 million, or 71%, in the previous
year. Sales in our Branded Products segment increased by A49.1 million, or 38%, to A177.4 million in 2016
from A128.3 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to optimizations in our product portfolio,
higher sales of core products and new product launches.

Russia

Sales in the Russian Federation decreased by A53.2 million, or 18%, to A242.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, from A295.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. On a constant currency
basis, sales of Generics increased by 18% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous
year. On an actual basis, sales grew by 11% to A92.5 million from A83.6 million in the previous year.
Generics accounted for 38% of sales in Russia, compared to 28% in the previous year. On a constant
currency basis, sales in our Branded Products segment decreased by 25% in the year ended December 31,
2016 compared to the previous year. On an actual basis sales decreased by 29% to A150.1 million in 2016
from A212.2 million in the previous year, primarily due to the growing consolidation among our customers
and softer overall demand, which necessitated conceding higher volume discounts in the period. These
adverse effects were partly offset by increases in the reimbursement prices payable according to the
Russian Vital and Essential Drugs List (VEP). To a lesser degree, the decrease was driven by adverse
foreign currency exchange effects as a result of the depreciation of the Russian ruble against the euro.
Branded Products accounted for 62% of sales in Russia, compared to 72% in the previous year.

Italy

Sales in Italy increased by A12.2 million, or 6%, to A201.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016,
from A189.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Sales of Generics in Italy increased by 6% to

111


-----

A157.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from A149.0 million in the previous year. This increase
was primarily a result of higher volumes. Generics accounted for 78% of sales in Italy, compared to 79% in
the previous year. Sales of Branded Products in Italy increased by 9% to A43.9 million from A40.4 million in
the previous year, primarily as a result of acquisitions of cough and cold medicines in Italy. Branded
Products accounted for 22% of sales in Italy, a slight increase from 21% in the previous year.

United Kingdom

On a constant currency basis, sales of Branded Products in the United Kingdom increased by 17% in the
year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year. On an actual basis, sales increased by 4% to
A175.4 million in 2016 from A168.0 million in the previous year. This increase was primarily due to the
impact of our acquisitions of the Socialites Group in December 2015 and BSMW Limited in February
2016, but was partly offset by adverse foreign currency exchange effects in connection with the
depreciation of the British pound sterling against the euro following the Brexit referendum, a week cough
and cold season at the beginning of the year 2016, which adversely impacted our sales of cough and cold
medicine, and poor summer weather in mid-2016, which reduced our sales of sunscreen products
compared to the previous year. Branded Products accounted for 88% of our sales in the UK market in the
year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 86% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Generics
accounted for the balance of our sales in the period.

Spain

In Spain, sales of Generics decreased by 1% to A105.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from
A107.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This slight decrease was primarily due to high sales
growth in the previous year due to numerous product launches that continued to perform well in 2016 and
the legal approval of discounts in 2016, which led to higher price discounts. Over the same period,
Generics accounted for 87% of Spanish sales, compared to 89% in the previous year. Branded Products
accounted for the balance of our sales in the period.

Belgium

In Belgium, sales of Generics decreased by A4.3 million, or 5%, to A90.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, from A95.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, particularly due to the
hesitant purchasing and sales strategy of our former Belgian distribution partner at the time. However, our
sales in Belgium in the second half of 2016 showed a positive trend, with a 66% increase in sales following
a 37% decrease in the first half of the year, and we terminated the underlying Omega Distribution
Agreement in December 2016 and have now insourced our logistics and sales operations in Belgium. Over
the same period, Generics accounted for 89% pf sales in Belgium, which represents a slight decrease from
91% in the previous year. Branded Products accounted for the balance of our sales in the period.

France

In France, sales of Generics increased by A1.8 million, or 2%, to A81.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, compared to A80.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily the result of higher volumes despite the market’s strong and continued price-based and discountbased competition. Over the same period, Generics accounted for 96% of our sales in France, which
represents an increase from 89% in the previous year. Branded Products accounted for the balance of our
sales in the period.

Vietnam

In Vietnam, on a constant currency basis, sales of Generics increased by 11% in the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year. On an actual basis, our sales of Generics in Vietnam
increased by 9% to A69.1 million, compared to A63.2 million in the previous period. This increase was
primarily due to higher volumes despite greater price pressure due to the positive outcome of certain
tenders held by Vietnamese hospitals, partly offset by adverse foreign currency exchange effects due to a
weaker Vietnamese dong. Over the same period, Generics accounted for 65% of our sales in Vietnam, a
slight decrease from 67% in the previous year. Sales of Branded Products increased by 21% on a constant
currency basis in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year. On an actual basis,
sales increased by 19% to A36.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from A30.8 million in the

112


-----

previous year, reflecting adverse foreign currency exchange effects from the Vietnamese dong. Branded
Products accounted for 35% of overall sales in Vietnam, a slight increase from 33% in the previous year.

Serbia

Our sales of Generics in Serbia, on an constant currency basis, declined by A16.7 million, or 23%, to
A57.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from A73.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. On an actual basis, sales declined by A17.9 million, or 24%, to A55.8 million from A73.7 million in the
previous year, primarily as a result of declining reimbursement prices, destocking of our wholesale
customers who continued to have high inventory levels and a slight depreciation of the Serbian dinar
against the euro. Over the same period, Generics accounted for 76% of our sales in Serbia, which
represents a slight decrease from 79% in the previous year. Branded Products accounted for the balance of
our sales in the period. Overall, the Serbian market continues to experience a general shift from Generics
to Branded Products in terms of sales mix.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales increased by A3.6 million, or 0.3%, to A1,105.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016,
from A1,101.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was in line with the growth in
sales. Cost of sales in 2016 included depreciation and amortization of A101.0 million, relatively stable
compared to A101.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The cost of sales ratio, which is defined
as cost of sales divided by sales, in the year ended December 31, 2016, was 51.7%, compared to 52.1% in
the previous year. Our gross margin, which is defined as gross profit divided by sales, improved to 48.3%
from 47.9% in the previous year. These results were primarily due to lower price discounts in the German
Generics segment as well as continued improvement in our cost of sales ratio.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Selling expenses increased by A5.7 million, or 1.2%, to A488.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016,
from A482.6 million in year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was mainly due to higher marketing
expenses in the Branded Products segment than in the previous year, particularly in Italy, Germany and
Belgium. The ratio of our selling expenses to our sales remained stable compared to the previous year at
22.8%.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

General and administrative expenses increased by A4.3 million, or 2.4%, to A182.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016, from A178.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in
administrative expenses was primarily due to the impact of business combinations.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research and development expenses increased by A0.1 million, or 0.2%, to A65.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, from A65.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The ratio of research and
development expenses to sales was 3.0% in 2016, compared to 3.1% in 2015.

**_Other Income_**

Other income decreased by A0.7 million, or 3.8%, to A19.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016,
from A20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other expenses increased by A55.2 million, or 66.0%, to A138.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2016, from A83.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to
increased impairment of intangible assets, the termination of significant parts of the aesthetics business
and the Omega Distribution Agreement, the restructuring of our German business, as well as a severance
payment to the former chairman of our Executive Board. These effects were partly offset by lower currency
translation expenses, in particular in the Russian subgroup comprising STADA CIS and its subsidiaries. In
addition, personnel expenses recognized under other expenses were markedly higher than in the previous
period, accounting for A24.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to A4.4 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in personnel expenses was due to the restructuring of our

113


-----

German business, a severance payment to the former chairman of our Executive Board and other
severance payments to management personnel.

**_Financial Result_**

Our financial result, which is mainly driven by our financial income and expenses, improved by
A15.2 million, or 23.1%, to a net expense of A50.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from a net
expense of A65.9 million in the previous year.

This improvement is primarily the result of lower interest expense which decreased to A52.9 million in the
year ended December 31, 2016, from A65.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The weighted
average interest rate accruing on our financial liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2016, was
approximately 1.8% per annum, compared to a weighted average rate of 2.6% per annum in the previous
year. The weighted average interest rate accruing on our non-current financial liabilities was approximately
1.7% per annum as of December 31, 2016, which represents a decrease from approximately 2.0% per
annum as of December 31, 2015. As for current financial liabilities, our weighted average interest rate was
approximately 3.1% per annum as of December 31, 2016, and therefore significantly lower than our
average interest rate as of December 31, 2015, of approximately 5.1% per annum.

In addition, the fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments resulted in a net expense of
A0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net expense of A3.1 million in the
previous year.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes decreased by A8.7 million, or 21.4%, to A31.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016,
from A40.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a tax rate
change in the United Kingdom and the continued utilization of tax loss carry-forwards in Germany. Our
reported tax rate improved by 70 basis points to 25.1% in the year ended December 31, 2016, from 25.8%
in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our adjusted tax rate was 23.9% in 2016, which represents an
increase from our adjusted tax rate of 22.0% in the previous year.

**_Key Earnings Figures_**

Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2016, were influenced by a relatively
high amount of special items, particularly due to reorganization expenses. In July 2016, we adopted certain
changes to our corporate structure, as well as corresponding changes to our reporting structures, pursuant
to which we decided to move away from regional responsibilities and initiate a transition to centralized
management of the two remaining Generics and Branded Products segments. This entailed a series of
structural measures, particularly in relation to personnel decisions and the re-evaluation of portfolio
activities. As a result, our reported key earnings figures differed substantially from our adjusted key
earnings figures in 2016. For a description of the special items underlying the adjustments in the year
ended December 31, 2016, see the discussion of ‘‘—Special Items’’ below.

_Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit decreased by A45.6 million, or 20%, to A178.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, from A223.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted operating profit,
which is net of special items, increased by 4% to A294.4 million from A283.8 million. The significantly
better performance in terms of adjusted operating profit as compared to reported operating profit is due to
significant special items which mainly relate to impairments/write-ups on fixed assets as well as portfolio
adjustments and restructuring expenses, which mainly relate to the termination of the Omega Distribution
Agreement, the consolidation of our German sales companies through two mergers and the termination of
further parts of the aesthetics business. For a description of the special items underlying the adjustments in
the year ended December 31, 2015, see the discussion of ‘‘—Special Items.’’

Reported operating profit in the Generics segment increased by A17.5 million, or 10%, to A195.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2016, from A177.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This
increase was primarily due to significant sales growth in Germany due to lower rebates. In addition, the
sales performance in Italy, Switzerland and Vietnam had a positive effect on our key earnings figures.
These effects were partly offset by our performance in Belgium, particularly due to the hesitant purchasing
and sales strategy of our former Belgian distribution partner at the time. Adjusted operating profit in the

114


-----

Generics segment increased by 17% to A214.2 million in 2016 from A182.7 million in the previous year.
Adjusted operating profit margin of Generics was 16.7%, compared to 14.5% in the previous year. The
reported operating profit margin in our Generics segment was 15.2%, compared to 14.1% in the previous
year.

Reported operating profit in the Branded Products segment decreased by A48.6 million, or 37%, to
A81.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from A130.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. Adjusted operating profit in the Branded Products segment decreased by 12% to A152.8 million from
A173.2 million in the previous year. This decrease was primarily due to weaker performance in the Russian
market. High inflation in Russia dampened consumer sentiment and consumer purchasing power, which
adversely affected our sales. Furthermore, growing consolidation among our customers necessitated
conceding higher volume discounts than in the previous period, and the depreciation of the Russian ruble
against the euro resulted in significant currency translation losses. In addition, despite the positive sales
performance of our British subgroup, Thornton & Ross, the continued weakness of the pound sterling
following the UK’s Brexit referendum and higher marketing and selling expenses weighed on our results.
Furthermore, the significant increase in sales of Branded Products in Germany in 2016 was offset by
expenses from portfolio adjustments and restructuring measures. Adjusted operating profit margin in our
Branded Products segment was 17.8%, compared to 20.3% in the previous year. The reported operating
profit margin in our Branded Products segment was 9.5%, compared to 15.2% in the previous year.

_Net Income, Adjusted Net Income_

Reported net income decreased by A24.5 million, or 22%, to A85.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2016, from A110.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted net income, which is adjusted for
special items, increased by A11.5 million, or 7%, to A177.3 million from A165.8 million.

_EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA decreased by A15.6 million, or 4%, to A361.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from
A377.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to adjustments for special items, Management
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% to A398.0 million from A389.4 million.

EBITDA in our Generics segment increased by A22.6 million, or 10%, to A255.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, from A233.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to
the aforementioned drivers behind reported operating profit in the Generics segment. The EBITDA
margin in Generics was 20.0%, compared to 18.5% in the previous year. Management Adjusted EBITDA
in our Generics segment increased by 14% to A264.9 million from A232.0 million in the previous year. This
increase was primarily due to the aforementioned drivers of our results in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and
Vietnam. The Management Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Generics segment was 20.7%, compared to
18.4% in the previous year.

EBITDA in our Branded Products segment decreased by A25.6 million, or 12%, to A186.2 million in the
year December 31, 2016, from A211.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due
to the aforementioned drivers behind reported operating profit in the Branded Products segment. The
EBITDA margin of Branded Products was 21.7%, compared to 24.8% in the previous year. Management
Adjusted EBITDA in our Branded Products segment decreased by 9% to A200.7 million from
A220.1 million in the previous year. This decrease was due mainly to the aforementioned developments in
Russia and the United Kingdom. The decrease in operating performance was more pronounced in terms of
reported operating profit than adjusted operating profit, primarily due to significant special items which
consisted principally of portfolio adjustments and restructuring measures, as well as foreign exchange
translation losses in the CIS subgroup. The Management Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Branded
Products segment was 23.4%, compared to 25.8% in the previous year.

**_Special Items_**

After adjusting for special items, earnings before taxes were higher by A116.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016, compared to our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2016. Earnings
before taxes were higher by A63.1 million after giving effect to special items in the year ended
December 31, 2015.

(1) In 2013, we completed several acquisitions (including the acquisition of Thornton & Ross in the United Kingdom, as well as our
acquisition of control over the Vietnamese companies Pymepharco and STADA Vietnam) which resulted in purchase price allocations
as well as measurement effects. Taking as a basis the levels in 2013, this adjustment adds back additional scheduled depreciation and
other measurement effects due to purchase price allocations as well as significant product acquisitions.

(2) Relates to transactional foreign exchange losses recorded in the income statement that we recognized due to the fluctuation against the
euro of the Russian ruble and other major currencies in the region CIS/ Eastern Europe. As of January 1, 2017, STADA has
discontinued this adjustment in its reporting, as it believes the significant fluctuations experienced in more recent periods have returned
to a more normal level.

(3) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary expenses, among other things, for the restructuring of the German business, the termination of
further parts of the aesthetics business, expenses related to the deconsolidation of the Egyptian subsidiary as well as the termination of
the Omega Distribution Agreement.

(4) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary income and expenses, among other things, from a milestone payment we received in the United
Kingdom, tax rate changes in the United Kingdom and a severance payment for the previous chairman of the Executive Board.

(1) In 2013, we completed several acquisitions (including the acquisition of Thornton & Ross in the United Kingdom, as well as our
acquisition of control over the Vietnamese companies Pymepharco and STADA Vietnam) which resulted in purchase price
allocations as well as measurement effects. Taking as a basis the levels in 2013, this adjustment adds back additional scheduled
depreciation and other measurement effects due to purchase price allocations as well as significant product acquisitions.

(2) Relates to transactional foreign exchange losses recorded in the income statement resulting from the fluctuation of the Russian
ruble and other significant currencies in the market region CIS/Eastern Europe during the periods presented. As of January 1,
2017, STADA has discontinued this adjustment in its reporting, as it believes the significant fluctuations experienced in more
recent periods have returned to a more normal level.

(3) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary income and expenses, among other things, from damage claim payments made and
received a change in the tax rate in the United Kingdom, a gain on disposal of a French Branded Products company and in
connection with the disposal of the German logistics activities.

The impact of special items on earnings before taxes in the year ended December 31, 2016, included
adjustments of (i) A65.5 million in impairments/write-ups on fixed assets, (ii) A11.4 million in effects from
purchase price allocations and product acquisitions, primarily due to additional scheduled depreciation
and other measurement effects due to purchase price allocations, as well as significant product acquisitions
compared to the levels in the year ended December 31, 2013, (iii) A9.1 million in currency effects CIS/
Eastern Europe, mainly representing transactional currency effects resulting from the fluctuation of the
Russian ruble, as well as other major currencies in the region CIS/Eastern Europe, (iv) A0.5 million from
the measurement of derivative financial instruments, (v) A28.2 million in portfolio adjustments/
restructuring expenses, which represents miscellaneous extraordinary expenses, including due to the
restructuring of the German business, the discontinuation of further parts of the aesthetics business,
expenses related to the deconsolidation of our Egyptian subsidiary as well as the termination of the Omega
Distribution Agreement and (vi) A2.0 million in other special items, mainly including a milestone payment
we received in the United Kingdom, tax rate changes in the United Kingdom and a severance payment for
the previous chairman of the Executive Board.

**_Sales and Adjusted Sales_**

_Consolidated Sales_

Sales increased by A52.9 million, or 3%, to A2,115.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from
A2,062.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the same period, adjusted sales increased by
A81.6 million, or 4%, to A2,133.8 million from A2,052.2 million. Our adjustment to sales accounts for
currency effects and portfolio changes. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted sales to
reported sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as comparative information for the previous
year:

(1) For all periods presented, sales of our Generics segment includes sales of our former Commercial Business segment. See ‘‘Our
_Reporting Segments—Operating Segments.’’_

(2) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the
comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in
each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period.

(3) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and
divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by
products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

The adjustment in respect of currency effects increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2015, by
A64.6 million. This adjustment primarily reflects the depreciation of two of our three most important
currencies against the euro, our reporting currency. Whereas the British pound sterling strengthened
against the euro and thereby drove sales in the reporting period, the Russian ruble was significantly weaker
and the Serbian dinar was slightly weaker than in the previous year. Furthermore, the Ukrainian hryvnia
depreciated against the euro, while the value of the Vietnamese dong and the Swiss franc increased
significantly. Foreign exchange translation effects in relation to other currencies only had a minor impact
on our sales.

The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes decreased sales in the year ended December 31, 2015 by
A45.9 million and in the previous year by A10.1 million, which included retrospective adjustments. Broken
down by region, the market region Central Europe accounted for a negative portfolio adjustment of
A38.8 million, the market region CIS/Eastern Europe accounted for a positive portfolio adjustment of
A5.5 million and the market region Asia/Pacific & MENA accounted for a negative portfolio adjustment of
A2.5 million.

_Constant-Currency Sales_

Constant-currency sales increased by A96.7 million, or 5%, to A2,049.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A1,952.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Sales by Operating Segment_

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported the results of our operations in three reporting
segments including Generics, Branded Products and Commercial Business. The Commercial Business
segment comprised the purchase and subsequent sale of third party products and was integrated into our
Generics segment in 2016. Our consolidated sales increased by A52.9 million, or 3%, to A2,115.1 million in
the year ended December 31, 2015, from A2,062.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted
for portfolio effects and foreign currency effects, sales increased by A81.6 million, or 4%, to
A2,133.8 million from A2,052.2 million in the previous year. Sales in our two main segments, Generics and
Branded Products, increased by A52.8 million, or 3%, to A2,071.1 million in 2015, compared to
A2,018.3 million in 2014. Adjusted for portfolio effects and foreign currency effects, sales of these two
segments increased by A86.3 million, or 4%, compared to the previous year. In terms of their contribution
to consolidated sales, the Generics and Branded Products segments remained constant compared to the
previous year’s level and together accounted for 97.9% of sales. The contribution of our Commercial
Business segment to sales in 2015 also remained constant compared to the previous year, at 2.1% of
consolidated sales.

Generics

Reported sales in our Generics segment accounted for A1,217.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2015, and remained relatively constant compared to A1,217.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.
This development resulted from higher sales of our German subsidiary ALIUD PHARMA GmbH and a
significant sales increase in our British, Spanish, French, Dutch and Vietnamese subsidiaries. Sales of
Generics in Russia, which is included in the market region CIS/Eastern Europe, and in Belgium, which is
included in the market region Central Europe, were weaker than in the previous year. Over the same
period, adjusted sales in the Generics segment increased by A17.3 million, or 1.4%, to A1,228.7 million from
A1,211.4 million. Generics accounted for 57.6% of consolidated sales in the year ended December 31, 2015,
which represents a slight decrease from 59.1% in the previous year. Our top five active pharmaceutical
ingredients accounted for sales of A117.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, or 9.7% of total
sales in the Generics segment, compared to A119.1 million, or 9.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2014.
With sales of A32.0 million, an increase of A8.2 million from A23.8 million in the previous year, Tilidine
Naloxone was the best-selling active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Generics segment in 2015.

Branded Products

Reported sales in our Branded Products segment increased by A53.1 million, or 7%, to A853.6 million in
the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to A800.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase was primarily driven by strong sales performance in the United Kingdom, Italy and Vietnam, and
partly offset by lower sales in Russia. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the Branded Products
segment increased by A69.0 million, or 9%, to A865.8 million from A796.8 million, with the majority of the
adjustment being driven by currency effects. Branded Products accounted for 40.3% of consolidated sales
in 2015, which represents an increase compared to 38.8% in 2014. Our top five Branded Products
accounted for sales of A199.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, or 23.4% of sales in the
Branded Products segment, compared to A184.4 million, or 23.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2014.
With sales of A62.9 million, compared to A51.3 million in the previous year, the Parkinson’s medicine
APO-Go was the best-selling product both within the Branded Products segment and overall.

_Sales by Geographic Area_

In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we reported our results of operations on the basis of four market regions,
including Germany, Central Europe, CIS/Eastern Europe and Asia/Pacific & MENA which are discussed
in more detail in the narrative descriptions below. However, in keeping with the presentation above in
relation to subsequent periods, the following tables show our sales by reporting segment and country for
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

Market Region Germany

Sales in the market region Germany increased by A12.3 million, or 3%, to A459.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A447.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to
higher sales in the Generics segment, partly offset by slightly lower sales in the Branded Products segment.
Furthermore, this increase in sales was achieved despite the MENA Reorganization (as defined below)
pursuant to which substantial parts of our business activities in the MENA region had been reassigned
from the market region Germany to the new market region Asia/Pacific & MENA. Based on the previous
regional segmentation (i.e., including business activities in the MENA region within the market region
Germany), sales in the market region Germany increased by 7% to A480.5 million from A447.3 million in
the previous year. As a percentage of consolidated sales, the market region Germany remained constant in
2015 at 21.7% of sales. Adjusted sales in this market region were 3% higher than in the previous year.

Sales generated in Germany, i.e. sales excluding export sales of the market region Germany and excluding
sales of other market regions in Germany, increased by 10% to A428.9 million in 2015 from A389.3 million
in the previous year. Sales of Generics in the German market increased by A41.0 million, or 15%, to
A306.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to A265.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014. Generics accounted for 71% of sales in the German market in 2015, compared to 68%
in the previous year. Sales in our Branded Products segment decreased slightly by A1.3 million, or 1%, to
A122.7 million in 2015, compared to A124.0 million in the previous year. Branded Products account for 29%
of sales in Germany, compared to 32% in the previous year. The cold medicine Grippostad accounted for
sales in Germany of A43.1 million in 2015, compared to A33.9 million in the previous year, and had a
market share of approximately 30% in the German market for flu drugs (based on data provided by
Quintiles IMS and excluding anti-infective agents); our sunscreen portfolio under the Ladival brand, which
in Germany accounted for sales of A28.6 million in 2015, compared to A27.3 million in the previous year (in
each case, based on data provided by Quintiles IMS), had a market share of approximately 33% in
Germany (based on data provided by Quintiles IMS) in 2015 and remains the market leader in the
German pharmacy market for sunscreens.

Market Region CIS/Eastern Europe

In the market region CIS/Eastern Europe, on a constant currency basis, sales increased by 11% in the year
ended December 31, 2015 compared to the previous year. On an actual basis, sales in this market region
decreased by A54.6 million, or 10%, to A509.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from
A564.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was mainly the result of adverse foreign
currency exchange effects. Sales in this market region accounted for 24.1% of consolidated sales in 2015,
which represents a slight decrease from 27.4% in the previous year. Out of the total sales in the market
region CIS/Eastern Europe, A9.6 million was attributable to export sales in 2015, compared to A9.5 million
in the previous year. Adjusted sales in this market region increased by 12% year-over-year.

Our sales in Russia and Serbia, the two largest market by sales in this market region, are discussed below.

Russia

Sales in the Russian Federation decreased by A64.9 million, or 18%, to A295.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A360.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the
significant depreciation of the Russian ruble against the euro. On a constant currency basis, sales increased
by 7% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the previous year. We experienced significant
fluctuations in our sales performance during the year 2015. In the first quarter of 2015, sales in ruble
declined by 21%, followed by increases of 18% and 60% in the second and third quarter, respectively, and
a decrease of 15% in the fourth quarter. We believe that our overall sales performance reflects a sustained
decrease in demand from Russian end-consumers, which account for approximately 94% of our sales in
Russia. Due to high seasonal orders that served to strengthen and further expand our strategic competitive
position in our distribution channels, we were able to slightly increase our market share in the Russian
market. Sales generated pursuant to the government program for the reimbursement of selected medicines
for individual population groups (DLO Program (as defined below)), which accounted for approximately
5% of our sales in Russia, exceeded the level in the previous year on a constant currency basis. Moreover,
on a constant currency basis, our sales in the Russian self-pay market increased in the high single-digit
percentage range, primarily due to strong performance of our Branded Products segment. We estimate
that approximately 1% of sales in Russia was due to other public sector clients, particularly via tenders.
Sales of Generics in the Russian market decreased by 29% to A83.6 million from A118.0 million in the
previous year. Generics accounted for 28% of our sales in Russia, which represents a slight decrease from
33% in the previous year. Sales of Branded Products in Russia declined by 13% to A212.2 million,
compared to A242.7 million in the previous year. Branded Products accounted for 72% of our sales in the
Russian market in 2015, compared to 67% in the previous year.

Serbia

Our sales on a constant currency basis in Serbia increased by A3.2 million or 3%, to A96.7 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015, from A93.5 million in the previous year. On an actual basis, sales increased
slightly by A0.3 million, or 0.3%, to A93.7 million from A93.4 million in the previous year, due to adverse
foreign currency exchange movements in the Serbian dinar, partly offset by higher sales in the Branded
Products segment. The Serbian market continued to experience a shift from Generics to Branded Products
in 2015. Sales of Generics in Serbia decreased by A3.2 million, or 4%, to A73.7 million from A76.8 million in

121


-----

the previous year. This decrease was mainly due to lower reimbursement rates which became effective as of
January 1, 2015. Over the same period, Generics accounted for 79% of our sales in Serbia, compared to
82% in the previous year. Sales of Branded Products in Serbia increased by A3.3 million, or 20%, to
A19.9 million from A16.6 million in the previous year. Over the same period, Branded Products accounted
for 21% of our sales in Serbia, which represents an increase from 18% in the previous year.

Market Region Central Europe

In the market region Central Europe, sales increased by A43.1 million, or 5%, to A999.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015, from A956.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This development
was primarily due to higher sales in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. Sales generated in this market
region accounted for 47.3% of consolidated sales in 2015, compared to 46.4% in the previous year. Out of
the total sales in the market region Central Europe, A46.0 million was attributable to export sales in 2015,
compared to A38.5 million in the previous year. Adjusted sales in this market region decreased by 3%
compared to the previous year.

Our sales in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Belgium and France, the five largest markets by sales in this
market region in 2015, are discussed below.

United Kingdom

Sales in the United Kingdom increased by A59.7 million, or 44%, to A194.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A135.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to
our acquisitions of the British company Internis Pharmaceuticals Ltd. in the fourth quarter of 2014, the
production and distribution rights for the Branded Product portfolio Flexitol in the second quarter of 2014,
as well as the launch of our Branded Product Ladival in January 2015 and favorable foreign currency
exchange effects due to the appreciation of the British pound sterling against the euro. On a constant
currency basis, sales increased by 31% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the previous
year. Adjusted sales in the United Kingdom increased by 14% in 2015 compared to the previous year. Over
the same period, sales of Branded Products in the United Kingdom increased by 42% to A168.0 million
from A118.2 million. Branded Products accounted for 86% of sales in the United Kingdom, compared to
87% in the previous year. In the United Kingdom, we are a specialized provider of selected generics with
only a small portfolio of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In spite of strong competition, our Generics
sales increased by A9.9 million, or 59%, to A26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from
A17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Generics accounted for 14% of sales in the United
Kingdom, which represents a slight increase from 13% in the previous year.

Italy

Sales in Italy increased by A8.0 million, or 4%, to A189.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015,
from A181.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales of Generics in Italy decreased slightly by
1% to A149.0 million from A150.5 million in the previous year. Over the same period, Generics accounted
for 79% of Italian sales, which represents a decrease from 83% in the previous year. Sales of Branded
Products in Italy increased by 31% to A40.2 million from A30.7 million in the previous year. This increase
was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Branded Products accounted for 21% of our sales in Italy,
which represents an increase compared to 17% in the previous year.

Spain

Sales in Spain increased by A7.4 million, or 7%, to A120.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015,
from A113.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly due to a new
cooperation with an important Spanish wholesaler, as well as due to product launches of top-selling
pharmaceutical ingredients despite strong price-based competition in the country. Our sales of Generics in
Spain increased by A5.9 million, or 6% to A107.0 million from A101.1 million in the previous year. Over the
same period, Generics accounted for 89% of sales in this market, remaining unchanged compared to the
previous year. Sales of Branded Products in Spain increased by A1.4 million, or 12% to A13.4 million from
A12.0 million in the previous year. Branded Products accounted for 11% of our sales in Spain, remaining
unchanged compared to the previous year.

Belgium

In Belgium, sales decreased by A46.3 million, or 31% to A103.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2015, from A150.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Our sales of Generics decreased by 33%
to A95.0 million from A141.6 million in the previous year, mostly due to both lower volumes and lower
prices. Our pricing was impacted by scheduled price reductions for a large part of the Generics portfolio
that took effect as of March 1, 2015, as well as discounts we granted to our customers. We believe the year
ended December 31, 2015 was marked by a stark contrast between lower sales in our Belgian operations on
the one hand and strong consumer demand on the other hand. We believe our sales performance was
temporarily adversely affected by lower purchases from wholesale customers who changed their working
capital management and reduced their inventories, as well as the uncertainty associated with the
then-pending takeover of Perrigo by Mylan in the second half of 2015. By contrast, both consumer sales
and our market share in Belgium remained stable. Over the same period, Generics accounted for 91% of
our sales in Belgium, compared to 94% in the previous year. Sales of Branded Products increased by 4% to
A8.9 million, compared to A8.6 million in the previous year. Branded Products accounted for 9% of our
overall sales in Belgium, which represents an increase from 6% in the previous year.

France

Sales in France decreased by A5.2 million, or 5%, to A90.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015,
from A95.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales of Generics in France increased by
A4.7 million, or 6% to A80.2 million from A75.5 million in the previous year. This increase was mainly due
to higher volumes despite price-based competition which entailed high discounts and reductions in
reimbursement rates. Over the same period, generics accounted for 89% of our sales in France, compared
to 79% in the previous year. Sales of Branded Products in France decreased by 50% to A10.0 million,
compared to A19.9 million in the previous year, which was mainly due to the reevaluation of our portfolio
carried out at the end of 2014. Branded Products accounted for 11% of sales in France, compared to 21%
in the previous year.

Market Region Asia/Pacific & MENA

With effect as of the 2015 fiscal year, the market region formerly referred to as Asia & Pacific was
expanded by adding substantial parts of our business activities in the MENA region and was renamed Asia/
Pacific & MENA (the ‘‘MENA Reorganization’’). The MENA Reorganization was part of a broader effort
to centralize our operations in these geographies. Previously, most of our operations in MENA had been
allocated to the market region Germany.

On an actual basis, sales in the market region Asia/Pacific & MENA increased by A52.1 million, or 55%, to
A146.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from A94.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2014. When excluding the newly included MENA operations, sales in the region increased by A31.3 million,
or 33%, to A125.4 million, compared to A94.1 million in the previous year. This increase was primarily due
to improved sales performance in Vietnam and China where we won several new contracts in tenders,
despite higher price pressure. The market region Asia/Pacific & MENA account for 6.9% of consolidated
sales in 2015, compared to 4.5% in the previous year. Adjusted sales in this market region increased by
32%.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales increased by A31.3 million, or 2.9%, to A1,101.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015,
from A1,070.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit, which we define as sales net of
cost of sales, was A1,013.4 million in 2015, compared to A991.8 million in 2014. Cost of sales included
depreciation and amortization of A101.5 million in 2015, compared to A100.8 million in the previous year.
The cost of sales ratio, which is defined as cost of sales divided by sales, in the year ended December 31,
2015, was 52.1%, compared to 51.9% in the previous year. Our gross margin, which is defined as gross
profit divided by sales, decreased to 47.9% in 2015, compared to 48.1% in the previous year. This decrease
was primarily the result of the ongoing currency and political crisis in CIS/Eastern Europe that began in
Russia and the Ukraine in 2014.

**_Selling Expenses_**

Selling expenses increased by A24.2 million, or 5.3%, to A482.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2015, from A458.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly the result of

123


-----

higher marketing expenses in our British and Italian markets. The ratio of our selling expenses to our sales
likewise increased to 22.8% in 2015, compared to 22.2% in 2014.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

General and administrative expenses increased by A25.6 million, or 16.7%, to A178.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015, from A152.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Expressed as a
percentage of sales, these expenses accounted for 8.4% of sales in 2015, which represents an increase
compared to 7.4% in 2014. This increase was mainly due to earnings recorded within personnel expenses
from past service cost in the amount of A15.9 million in the previous year in connection with a change in
the defined benefit plan for the Chairman of the Executive Board and the resulting changes with respect to
the benefits awarded in accordance with the former benefit plan.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research and development expenses increased by A8.1 million, or 14.2%, to A65.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A56.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The sales-related ratio of
research and development expenses was 3.1% in 2015, compared to 2.8% in 2014. Our reported
development costs include development costs that may not be capitalized and have to be expensed as
incurred. The amount of capitalized development costs for new products decreased to A26.1 million in
2015, compared to A27.5 million in the previous year. This implies that we capitalized 28.6% of all
development in 2015, compared to 32.6% in 2014. Amortization of capitalized development costs was
approximately A8 million in 2015, compared to approximately A6 million in 2014.

**_Other Income_**

Other income decreased by A0.1 million, or 0.2%, to A20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015,
from A20.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other expenses decreased by A71.5 million, or 46.1%, to A83.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2015, from A155.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was mainly the result of
lower impairment of other intangible assets. In addition, we recognized significant impairment charges
against goodwill associated with our operations in the market regions CIS/Eastern Europe and Asia/
Pacific & MENA in 2014 which did not recur in 2015. The remaining other expenses include personnel
expenses in the amount of A4.4 million in 2015, compared to A5.8 million in the previous year.

**_Financial Result_**

Our financial result, which is mainly driven by our financial income and expenses, decreased by
A2.1 million, or 3.3%, to a net expense of A65.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from a net
expense of A63.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

This decrease is mainly the result of lower interest expense which decreased to A65.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015, from A70.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The weighted average
interest rate accruing on our financial liabilities as of December 31, 2015, was approximately 2.6% per
annum, compared to a weighted average rate of 3.7% per annum in the previous year. The weighted
average interest rate accruing on our non-current financial liabilities was approximately 2.0% per annum
as of December 31, 2015, down from approximately 3.3% per annum as of December 31, 2014. As for
current financial liabilities, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.1% per annum as of
December 31, 2015, and therefore higher than our rate as of December 31, 2014 of approximately 4.6%
per annum.

In addition, the fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments resulted in a net expense of
A3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a net gain of A3.6 million in the previous
year.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes decreased by A14.0 million, or 25.6%, to A40.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015,
from A54.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a tax rate
change in the United Kingdom, as well as a revised profit allocation within the Target Group. Our reported

124


-----

tax rate improved by 18 percentage points to 25.8% in the year ended December 31, 2015, from 43.8% in
the year ended December 31, 2014. The significant decrease was primarily a result of goodwill impairment
associated with our operations in the market regions CIS/Eastern Europe and Asia/Pacific & MENA,
which occurred only in the previous period and was not deductible for tax purposes, as well as a tax rate
reduction in the United Kingdom. Our adjusted tax rate, which measures our performance based on
adjustments for special items, was 22.0% in 2015, down from our adjusted tax rate of 24.2% in the previous
year.

**_Key Earnings Figures_**

Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2015, were primarily driven by the
following factors: In the market region Asia/Pacific & MENA, our sales increased in excess of 10%
year-over-year. Sales also increased in the Central Europe and Germany market regions. Despite difficult
economic conditions, on a constant currency basis, sales also increased in the CIS/Eastern Europe market
region. A significant part of our special items in 2015, which accounted for A16.9 million both before and
after taxes, related to currency translation expenses due to the weak Russian ruble, the strong depreciation
of the Ukrainian hryvnia and a very weak Kazakhstani tenge. For a description of the special items
underlying the adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015, see the discussion of ‘‘—Special Items’’
below.

_Operating Profit, Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit increased by A35.2 million, or 19%, to A223.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A188.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted operating profit
decreased by 12% to A283.8 million in 2015, compared to A320.7 million in the previous year. The
significantly better performance in terms of reported operating profit as compared to adjusted operating
profit is due to significant special items in the previous year which mainly related to impairment of further
intangible assets following impairment tests including the market region CIS/Eastern Europe, as well as
impairments on goodwill within the market regions CIS/Eastern Europe and Asia/Pacific & MENA.

Reported operating profit in the Generics segment increased by A70.2 million, or 65%, to A178.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2015, from A108.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase was primarily due to significantly higher operating profits of our German company ALIUD
PHARMA, the Spanish subsidiary Laboratorio STADA and our British subsidiaries. In addition, our
operating profit in 2014 was affected by high goodwill impairment charges due to the crisis in the market
region CIS/Eastern Europe. The performance of our operations in Belgium and France, by contrast,
decreased compared to the previous year. In Belgium, regulatory changes resulted in lower unit prices for
our operations. In France, volumes increased but prices were lower compared to the previous period, as
the ceiling on discounts was increased. Due to the higher volumes, functional expenses increased and
reduced operating profit. The reported operating profit margin of Generics was 14.7% in 2015, compared
to 8.9% in the previous year. Adjusted operating profit in the Generics segment increased by 4% in 2015 to
A183.6 million, compared to A176.9 million in the previous year. The weaker performance in terms of
adjusted line items compared to the reported line items was due to a higher base of adjustments in the
previous year, which mainly related to goodwill impairment in the market region CIS/Eastern Europe, as
well as to currency translation losses associated with the CIS subgroup. Adjusted operating profit margin
of Generics was 15.1% in 2015, compared to 14.5% in the previous year.

Reported operating profit in the Branded Products segment decreased by A8.2 million, or 6%, to
A130.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from A138.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2014. This decrease was primarily due to declining operating segment profit in the market region CIS/
Eastern Europe due to the weak Russian ruble. In contrast, operating profit of the British and Italian
subsidiaries increased markedly and also improved in the market region Asia/ Pacific & MENA. Our
reported operating profit margin in the Branded Products segment was 15.2% in 2015, compared to 17.3%
in the previous year. Adjusted operating profit in the Branded Products segment decreased by 10% to
A173.2 million in 2015, compared to A192.9 million in the previous year. The weaker performance in terms
of adjusted line items compared to the reported line items was due to a higher base of adjustments in the
previous year, which mainly related to impairment on additional intangible assets after impairment tests
and currency translation losses associated with the CIS subgroup. Adjusted operating profit margin of
Branded Products was 20.3% in 2015, compared to 24.4% in the previous year.

125


-----

Reported operating profit in the Commercial Business segment decreased to a net loss of A0.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a net profit of A0.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014.

_Net Income, Adjusted Net Income_

Reported net income increased by A45.8 million, or 71%, to A110.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2015, from A64.6 million in the previous year. Adjusted net income, which is adjusted for special items,
declined by A20.4 million, or 11%, to A165.8 million, compared to A186.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014.

_EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA decreased by A41.7 million, or 10%, to A377.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from
A418.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Management Adjusted EBITDA decreased by
A42.5 million, or 10%, to A389.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 from A431.9 million in the
year ended December 31, 2014.

EBITDA in our Generics segment increased by A10.7 million, or 5%, to A233.9 million in 2015, from
A223.1 million in the previous year. This increase was due to the aforementioned drivers of reported
operating profit in the Generics segment. The EBITDA margin in Generics was 19.2%, compared to
18.3% in the previous year. The Management Adjusted EBITDA in our Generics segment increased by
2% to A232.8 million, compared to A228.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to the aforementioned drivers of our adjusted operating profit in the German, Spanish and
UK markets. The Management Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Generics segment was 19.1%, compared
to 18.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014.

EBITDA in our Branded Products segment decreased by A19.8 million, or 9%, to A211.8 million, from
A231.5 million in the previous year. This decrease was due to the aforementioned drivers of reported
operating profit in the Branded Products segment. The EBITDA margin of Branded Products was 24.8%,
compared to 28.9% in the previous year, with such decrease being driven by higher marketing and selling
expenses as well as higher bad debt provisions with the biggest allowance created for receivables from the
Russian retailer ROSTA. The Management Adjusted EBITDA in our Branded Products segment
decreased by 8% to A220.1 million, compared to A240.0 million in the previous year. This decrease was
mainly due to the aforementioned drivers of adjusted operating profit. The Management Adjusted
EBITDA margin in our Branded Products segment was 25.8% in 2015, compared to 30.3% in the year
ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in Management Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Branded
Products segment was driven by a combination of a decline in the performance in the market region CIS/
Eastern Europe primarily due to a weakening of purchasing power on the back of Russian ruble
depreciation and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to support the development of
the Branded Products portfolio in key geographies.

**_Special Items_**

After adjusting for special items, earnings before taxes were higher by A63.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015, compared to our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2015. By
comparison, earnings before taxes were higher by A128.6 million after giving effect to special items in the
year ended December 31, 2014.

(1) In 2013, we completed several acquisitions (including the acquisition of Thornton & Ross in the United Kingdom, as well as our
acquisition of control over the Vietnamese companies Pymepharco and STADA Vietnam) which resulted in purchase price
allocations as well as measurement effects. Taking as a basis the levels in 2013, this adjustment adds back additional scheduled
depreciation and other measurement effects due to purchase price allocations as well as significant product acquisitions.

(2) Relates to transactional foreign exchange losses recorded in the income statement that we recognized due to the fluctuation
against the euro of the Russian ruble and other major currencies in the region CIS/ Eastern Europe. As of January 1, 2017,
STADA has discontinued this adjustment in its reporting, as it believes the significant fluctuations experienced in more recent
periods have returned to a more normal level.

(3) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary income and expenses, among other things, from indemnification payments we made and
received, tax rate changes in the United Kingdom, a disposal gain from the sale of a French branded products company and
expenses in connection with the disposal of our German logistics activities.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis have been, and prior to the First Settlement Date
were, our operating cashflows and financing cashflows from drawings under our Existing Debt and
factoring facilities. Following the First Settlement Date, our principal sources of liquidity are expected to
be our operating cashflows and financing cashflows from drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility and
factoring facilities. The availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Revolving Credit
Facility, will be subject to certain conditions.

128


-----

Our ability to generate operating cashflows depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends
to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ We believe that, based on our
current level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016,
our cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility and factoring facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital
expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, legal prohibitions on
such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses or
other events could further reduce the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future
financing cashflows will be limited by the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may
have important negative consequences for you. See ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ In addition,_
any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make
payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our
leverage.

The proceeds from the Offerings of the Notes will be used as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017:

**Year ended** **Six months**

**_Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2016_**

_Cash Flow From Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by A23.5 million, or 21%, to a cash inflow of A89.5 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2017, from a cash inflow of A113.0 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016. This decrease was primarily due to a significantly higher increase in inventories than in the previous
period and an increase in trade accounts receivable compared to a decrease in the previous period, which
was mainly due to a lower increase in the factoring volume than in the previous period. These drivers were
partly offset by higher gross cash flow (as defined in our Financial Statements) than in the previous period,
as well as a lower decrease in trade accounts payable.

_Cash Flow Used In Investing Activities_

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by A24.9 million, or 25%, to a cash outflow of A73.2 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from a cash outflow of A98.1 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2016. This decrease was due to (i) lower payments for investments in business combinations than
in the previous period, which decreased to a cash outflow of A2.9 million in the six months ended June 30,
2017, from a cash outflow of A13.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. In the first six months of
2017, these cash flows were driven by the payment of the final purchase price installments for our
acquisitions of the Argentinean company Laboratorio Vannier as well as a product portfolio in Serbia and
of the purchase price for our acquisition of the Serbian wholesaler Velexfarm. In the first six months of
2016, these cash flows were primarily due to the first few major purchase price installments for our

129


-----

acquisition of the Argentinean company Laboratorio Vannier and of the purchase price for the British
company BSMW Limited. The decrease in cash impact was further driven by higher payments for
investments in property, plant and equipment in the previous period which was partly offset by an increase
in payments for investments in intangible assets in the first six months of 2017 compared to the previous
period.

_Cash Flow From (Used In) Financing Activities_

Cash flow from (used in) financing activities changed by A273.4 million to a cash outflow of A44.1 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2017, from a cash inflow of A229.3 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016. This change was primarily due to the issuance of additional promissory note loans in an aggregate
principal amount of A350 million in the previous period, part of the proceeds of which was used to
refinance an earlier series of promissory loan notes in an aggregate principal amount of A188 million that
would have matured in December 2016.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2015_**

_Cash Flow From Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A21.8 million, or 7.0%, to a cash inflow of A333.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2016, from a cash inflow of A311.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. This increase was primarily due to the cash impact resulting from lower payments in respect of
interest and income taxes than in the previous year, a significantly lower increase in inventories than in the
previous year and an increase in trade accounts payable, compared to a significant decrease in trade
accounts payable in the previous year. These drivers were partly offset by higher cash outflows in respect of
other net assets than in the previous year.

_Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities_

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by A5.5 million, or 3.1%, to a cash outflow of A172.7 million
in the year ended December 31, 2016, from a cash outflow of A178.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the cash impact resulting from lower payments for
investments in intangible assets in 2016 than in the previous year. In 2016, such payments primarily related
to the development of approvals and trademarks, as well as licenses in Germany and the United Kingdom.
Furthermore, the decrease was driven by lower payments for investments in business combinations than in
the previous period. In 2016, such payments related to our acquisition of a product portfolio in Serbia, the
British company Natures Aid and the Argentinean company Laboratorio Vannier.

_Cash Flow From (Used In) Financing Activities_

Cash flow from (used in) financing activities changed by A210.3 million to a cash inflow of A55.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2016, from a cash outflow of A155.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. This was primarily due to the cash impact resulting from significantly higher borrowings than in the
previous year. In 2016, we issued additional promissory loan notes in an aggregate principal amount of
A350 million. In addition, the cash inflow was driven by significantly lower repayments of financial
liabilities than in the previous year. In 2016, we used a portion of the proceeds from our newly issued
promissory notes to refinance our then-outstanding A188.0 million aggregate principal amount of
promissory loan notes that would have matured in December 2016.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2015, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014_**

_Cash Flow From Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A87.9 million, or 39.3%, to a cash inflow of A311.7 million
in the year ended December 31, 2015, from a cash inflow of A223.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2014. This increase was primarily due to the cash impact resulting from significantly lower cash outflows in
respect of other net assets than in the previous year and lower payments in respect of income tax than in
the previous year, partly offset by a cash-effective increase in trade accounts receivable.

_Cash Flow Used In Investing Activities_

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by A83.8 million, or 32.0%, to a cash outflow of
A178.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, from a cash outflow of A262.0 million in the year

130


-----

ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to the cash impact resulting from significantly lower
payments for investments in intangible assets in 2015 than in the previous year. In 2015, investing cash
flows were impacted by the settlement of outstanding purchase price instalments related to the acquisition
of the Russian Branded Product portfolio Aqualor, the Russian Branded Products AndraDoz and
NeroDoz, the acquisition of the British company Internis, as well as the payment of the purchase prices for
our acquisitions of the Austrian company SCIOTEC Diagnostic Technologies and the British Socialites
group. In 2014, our investing cash flows were driven by payments in connection with our acquisition of the
Russian Branded Product portfolio Aqualor, the Branded Product portfolio Flexitol and the British
company Internis Pharmaceuticals.

_Cash Flow From (Used in) Financing Activities_

Cash flow from (used in) financing activities changed by A238.8 million to a cash outflow of A155.1 million
in the year ended December 31, 2015, from a cash inflow of A83.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2014. This decrease was primarily due to the cash impact resulting from lower borrowings than in the
previous year. In 2015, we received cash inflows of A300 million from the issuance of a corporate bond in
an aggregate principal amount of A300 million and drawings on two additional loan facilities in the third
quarter of 2015. These cash inflows were partly offset by significantly higher repayments of financial
liabilities in 2015 than in the previous year, driven by our refinancing of a then-outstanding corporate bond
in an aggregate principal amount of A350 million that matured in April 2015.

**_Net Working Capital_**

Net working capital as defined by us consists of inventories and trade receivables less trade payables. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’ The following table summarizes
our change in net working capital for the periods indicated:

**Six months**
**Year ended** **ended**
**December 31,** **June 30,**
**2014** **2015** **2016** **2016** **2017**
**(E million)**

In the six months ended June 30, 2017, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A68.3 million, compared to a cash outflow of A33.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The
change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A47.7 million and was primarily due to a
cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in France and Serbia, partly as a result of
strong sales at the end of the year 2016 that led to higher inventory levels in the six months ended June 30,
2017. In Germany, the level of our inventories increased primarily due to the growing tender business in
the Generics segment. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of
A15.9 million, primarily due to strong sales especially in Russia. The change in trade accounts payable
accounted for a cash outflow of A4.7 million and was primarily due to reporting date effects, especially in
Germany.

In the year ended December 31, 2016, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A11.7 million. The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A18.0 million and was primarily
due to a cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in Russia and Serbia as a consequence
of increased safety stock of several substances. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a
cash inflow of A1.2 million, driven by increased factoring volume compared to the end of the year 2015 and
partly offset by strong sales at year-end, especially in Russia. The change in trade accounts payable
accounted for a cash inflow of A5.0 million and resulted primarily from reporting date effects, especially in
Italy.

In the year ended December 31, 2015, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A91.6 million. The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A52.9 million, primarily due to a
cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in Russia, partly to make provisions for sales of
certain products expected in 2016. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of
A12.9 million, mainly as a result of strong sales at the end of the year, especially in Russia, as well as lower

131


-----

factoring volume in Belgium, Serbia and Italy compared to 2014. The change in trade accounts payable
accounted for a cash outflow of A25.8 million, mainly due to a cash-effective decrease in trade payables of
subsidiaries in Germany as a result of lower trade accounts payable of STADApharm in Germany to health
insurance organizations as a result of decreased operating activities and in Belgium as a result of lower
business volume.

In the year ended December 31, 2014, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A75.7 million. The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A58.0 million. The change in trade
accounts receivable accounted for a cash inflow of A0.6 million. The change in trade accounts payable
accounted for a cash outflow of A18.3 million.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures mainly consist of investments in maintenance (including replacements) and
growth expenditures (which relate to our expansion into new markets and increased penetration of existing
markets). We finance our capital expenditures with cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from
financing activities.

The table below sets forth our capital expenditures based on cash flows for the periods indicated.

**Six months**
**Year ended** **ended**
**December 31,** **June 30,**
**2014** **2015** **2016** **2016** **2017**
**(E million)**

(1) Significant investments and acquisitions relate to investments in intangible assets and business combinations.

(2) Other capital expenditure includes maintenance, other investments in tangible assets and financial assets as well as other minor
investments in various intangible assets.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions decreased by A2.4 million, or 8.2%, to
A27.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, from A29.4 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016. Other capital expenditures decreased by A23.4 million, or 32.7%, to A48.2 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2017, from A71.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was mainly
driven by expenditures incurred in Serbia in connection with the construction of a new building dedicated
to quality management and the acquisition of new equipment in the first six months of 2016, whereas such
expenditures did not recur in the first six months of 2017.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions decreased by A2.7 million, or 3.0%, to
A86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from A89.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2015. This decrease was mainly due to lower payments in connection with certain acquisitions. Other
capital expenditures decreased by A3.6 million, or 3.6%, to A97.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, from A101.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was driven by lower
expenditures for minor intangible assets.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions decreased by A113.5 million, or 56.0%, to
A89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from A202.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2014. This decrease was mainly due to lower investments in material intangible assets, as substantial
investments made during 2014 in connection with our purchase of the Russian Branded Product portfolio
Aqualor, the Branded Product portfolio Flexitol, and the British company Internis, did not recur in 2015.
Other capital expenditures increased by A29.5 million, or 41.3%, to A101.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, from A71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly
due to higher investments in tangible assets in connection with the expansion and renewal of production
facilities and plants, as well as test laboratories and from higher expenditures for minor intangible assets.

For the year ending December 31, 2017, our management expects to incur capital expenditures in the
amount of approximately A159 million.

(2) Represents the estimated euro equivalent initial principal amount of the Term Loan B Facility under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement. The Term Loan B Facility may be borrowed in two tranches consisting of euro and pound sterling and
therefore the actual euro equivalent amount of the Term Loan B Facility may vary from time to time due to exchange rate
fluctuations. As of September 22, 2017, the Term Loan B Facility has been drawn in an amount of A250 million. See ‘‘Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’ See ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

(3) As of September 22, 2017, the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn in an amount of A37 million. See ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’_

We have a small number of finance leases and several operating leases primarily for our office buildings, IT
equipment and various vehicles. The table below summarizes our leases as of December 31, 2016:

(1) Includes leases for buildings, including our head office in Bad Vilbel and other leases for subsidiaries, vehicles and office
equipment.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a
current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Most importantly, we
lease our Ladival brand under a sale and leaseback agreement, which provides us with the option to
repurchase the brand at fair market value in 2020. We also in-license certain of our Generics, none of
which individually represents a material portion of our business. We record provisions for estimated
warranty claims in connection with product returns, based on historical data. As of December 31, 2016, our
provision in respect of warranties was A18.8 million. In the periods under discussion, the majority of our
products returns was due to returns of excess stock by certain customers in our Branded Products segment.
We also regularly enter into guarantees of indebtedness drawn by other entities within our group.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk**

Our segments operate in competitive markets and are subject to changes in business, economic and
competitive conditions. Our business is subject to:

- default risks;

- liquidity risks;

- interest rate risks and interest rate management / risks relating to interest rate instruments subject to
hedge accounting; and

- currency risks and risks relating to currency management.

133


-----

Developments in any of these risk areas could have a material effect on our results.

Risks that could have a significant influence on the net assets, financial position and results of operations
of the Target Group are described below. Risks are reported in the form of net risks, i.e. risks including the
measures taken to manage the risk, and by the individual segments. If no segment is explicitly referenced,
the described risks affect both the Branded Products and Generics segments. As yet unknown risks and
those that have been assessed as insignificant could also influence net assets, financial position and results
of operations.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Financial Risks**

We have exposure to liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, default risk, transfer price risk and
impairment risk. Our risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks we face.
We counter financial risks with finance policy methods and specific risk management. Developments in any
of these risk areas could have a material effect on our results. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and our Financial
Statements included elsewhere herein for further details on these and other risks we face.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuation in the operational course of business. The objective of
our liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of our Target Group at all times
through sufficient liquidity reserves and ready access to credit lines. Our financing comprises short-term
and long-term borrowings from banks, promissory loan notes, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, we
generate substantial operating cash flows and have access to credit financing from various banks that can
be utilized as needed.

**_Currency Risk_**

Due to our international business operations, we are subject to risks arising from exchange rate
fluctuations. These particularly result from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British pound
sterling and Serbian dinar in relation to the euro. A currency risk consists of potential changes in value,
especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other than the respective functional currency, or as a
result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk). However, we believe that we could mitigate this risk
to a certain extent through natural hedges and the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used
to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the year ended
December 31, 2016, we used foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The maturity
dates of futures contracts are generally set as necessary to match our anticipated cash flows. The remaining
term of the contracts is currently up to one year.

Furthermore, currency risks also exist in relation to the translation of the balance sheet items, as well as
the conversion of income and expenses of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone (translation risk). In this
connection, the current political conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, as well as
negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU over Brexit, could indirectly continue to have a
negative influence on exchange rates and our results of operations.

For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as
of December 31, 2016, showed that in the financial year 2016, an appreciation or devaluation of the
functional currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10% changed our EBITDA by approximately
A1.8 million. At the same time, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency in relation to the
British pound sterling of 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately A0.6 million.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are subject to interest rate risks from financial assets and financial indebtedness, primarily in the
Eurozone and Russia. We calculate existing interest rate risks with sensitivity analyses that show the effects
of changes in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as on equity.
Should the sensitivity analysis show that interest rate fluctuations could lead to significant impacts, we
could use derivative hedging instruments to avoid the risk.

A sensitivity analysis showed that an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in 2016 would
have resulted in additional expenses of A1.4 million, compared to A0.7 million in the previous year and a

134


-----

decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in additional income of
A0.6 million, compared to A0.7 million in the previous year.

Following the Transaction and subject to the assumptions set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ our
indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (which will bear a floating interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR), the Senior Secured
Notes and Senior Notes (each which have a fixed rate coupon).

**_Default Risks_**

We are exposed to default risk in our operating business or as a result of financing activities if contracting
parties fail to meet their obligations. To avoid default risks in financing activities, appropriate credit
management processes are in place and such transactions are generally only entered into with
counterparties of sufficient credit quality.

Risks of default also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. We therefore strive to maintain
business relations only with counterparties of sufficient credit quality. In addition, we partly use credit
support such as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard ourselves against default
risk. Overdue receivables are continuously monitored and potential default risks are addressed through
value adjustments. In addition, there is the risk that in a difficult economic and financial environment,
national healthcare systems delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners directly or
indirectly increasing the risks of default.

**_Transfer Price Risks_**

We have an international network of subsidiaries and carry out strategic functions centrally through
STADA Arzneimittel AG. As a result, an overarching tax transfer-pricing model for the billing of
intragroup services is of increasing importance. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices
for tax purposes, for example from retroactive tax claims of the local tax authorities against one of our
subsidiaries, are limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a
comprehensive definition of transfer prices in our group-wide policies. However, there can be no assurance
that transfer prices will be recognized by the competent authorities.

**_Impairment Risks_**

The valuation rates of assets presented on our consolidated balance sheet are subject to changes in market
and business relationships and thereby to changes in fair value. Our annual and case-related impairment
test may result in significant charges against earnings and adverse impacts on balance sheet ratios. This
particularly applies to goodwill primarily resulting from purchase price allocations linked to previous
acquisitions, and for other intangible assets. All relevant risks are considered in the context of the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in our Financial Statement is
determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, we make estimates and assumptions
relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are considered to be
appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are constantly
re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual circumstances. The significant estimates,
accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed below.

**_Purchase Price Allocations_**

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods used for purchase price allocations are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least
once a year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units

135


-----

aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a market region within
our two operating segments for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill.

We carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take
place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of
each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in
use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. Following this three-year period, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected
long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions are made in order to determine the value in
use, including assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the discount
rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually according to
the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined
assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data. Significant changes to the
assumptions and calculation parameters used would influence the determination of the value in use of the
cash-generating units.

Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the recoverable
amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the
carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups
are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests
and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these
assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For
this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. In our case the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are relating to the umbrella brands of
Hemofarm, Pymepharco and Vannier, all capitalized in the context of their respective acquisitions.

Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests.
Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing
an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable
amount of an asset is lower that it’s carrying amount. At each reporting date, we assess whether indications
for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are exceeded, the
asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value
less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted cash flow
method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the weighted
average cost of capital, which is determined individually for two operating segments with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are reported under the caption ‘‘Other expenses.’’

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, our
cash-generating units are defined at the level of individual assets within the reportable segments of
Branded Products and Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income.’’

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,

136


-----

estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

**_Development Costs_**

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

**_Valuation Allowances on Receivables_**

We make valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in Central and Eastern European
countries.

**_Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

We maintain defined benefit plans in various countries, according to which the amount of pension benefits
depends on the employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service or which contain guarantees
not permitting recognition as defined contribution plan. Pension obligations are measured in accordance
with actuarial principles using the projected unit credit method. The pension provisions recognized in the
balance sheet correspond to the present value of the defined benefit obligation on the balance sheet date
less the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for any limitation of the benefit asset. In addition to earned
pensions and entitlements, the calculation also includes future salary and pension increases. For our
German companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the
Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. In other countries in which we operate, country-specific mortality tables
are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be
based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting
date. In countries where there is no liquid market for corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on
the basis of market yields on government bonds. Changes to the assumptions can significantly influence the
amount of future pension costs.

The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized with no effect on income. It
differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions
as well as due to experience-based amendments. They are recognized directly in equity with no effect on
income in the period in which they occur (‘‘other comprehensive income, OCI’’). The relevant amounts are
reported separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the calculation of the
portion of the interest income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, the standard IAS 19
requires the application of the discount rate underlying the obligation. The remainder of the actual income
from plan assets is to be recognized directly in other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss.
The current service cost is recognized in staff costs of the individual functional areas. All past service cost
that arises in the financial year shall be recognized immediately through profit or loss.

Several of our subsidiaries also grant their employees defined contribution plans. In these cases, we pay
defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a
voluntary basis without incurring additional liabilities. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans are
recognized as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas.

The other non-current provisions contain ‘‘anniversary provisions’’ and other long-term employee benefits.
Commitments to anniversary payments are accounted in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 and
other long-term employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not
recognized without an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately
reported as income or expenditure in the relevant functional areas. Furthermore, there is a working time
accounts plan that is accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.

-----

**_Other Provisions_**

We set aside other provisions in case of current legal or constructive obligations to third parties arising
from past events that will likely lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that can be
reliably determined. An outflow of assets embodying economic benefits is considered as probable if it is
more likely to occur than not. Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into account all
recognizable risks, offers the best possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the obligations. Any
existing reimbursement claims by third parties are not netted with other provisions. Expenses from the
creation of provisions are allocated to functional costs according to where they arise. If changes in
estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other provisions are reversed on a pro rata basis and
recognized through profit and loss under the item where the original expense was recognized.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. We set aside provisions in case of a present external obligation and a
probable outflow of resources (meaning that an outflow is more likely to occur than not). Provisions in
relation to pending legal disputes are created based on how we estimate the prospects of success of these
methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can
change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent
liabilities.

**_Provisions for Warranties and Discounts_**

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for warranties may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes include actual taxes on income as well as deferred tax liabilities. The tax receivables and
liabilities recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and
outside Germany in respect of the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as from previous years, if
applicable. The tax receivables and liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the
reporting date or known and already concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable profit is
generated.

Deferred tax liabilities are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities
and their valuation rate in the IFRS financial statements as well as for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will result against which the
temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences
taxable in the future. We determine deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the reporting date
or those that have already been resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax receivables and
liabilities are offset if these relate to the same taxation authority.

The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that
are recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with
an effect on deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise.

We operate in various countries and are obliged to pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In
order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred tax liabilities in the Target Group, the
expected income taxes as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of
certain balance sheet items according to IFRS are determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final
taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on current and
deferred taxes and thus on the net assets, financial position and results of our operations in the respective
period. Furthermore, we consider increasingly important the existence of a comprehensive tax transferpricing model for the remuneration of intragroup services within the Target Group. Possible risks of
non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes are limited by the introduction of appropriate
communication methods and an overarching definition of transfer pricing in the form of group-wide
policies.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

We counter risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively
used to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and
investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

Derivative financial instruments exist in the context of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or
loss as well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and
hedges of net investments in a foreign operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging
instruments in the context of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39.

We use cash flow hedges to protect against fluctuations of cash flows associated with an accounted asset or
an accounted financial liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the fair value of these
hedging instruments are recognized with no effect on income in the amount of the effective part of the
hedging relationship directly in equity. A transfer to the income statement takes place in the period when
the underlying hedged item becomes effective. The ineffective part of the changes in value is, however,
recognized directly in the income statement.

In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of accounted assets or accounted
liabilities or fixed off balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions
are recorded in our income statement, as if they were changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged
items. If the requirements for hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously
hedged items are adjusted on the basis of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation are treated according to the same accounting policies as cash flow hedges.

We regularly review the effectiveness of the hedging relationships as a prerequisite for hedge accounting
pursuant to IAS 39. A hedging relationship is in general considered to be effective, if changes in fair value
of the hedging transaction are both prospectively and retrospectively within a range of 80% to 125% of the
offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item. We measure all other financial liabilities, in particular
trade payable as well as financial liabilities, at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not yet made use of the option to designate financial
liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates,’’ are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

As of December 31, 2016, we hold derivatives without hedging relationship in the form of interest rate/
currency swaps and currency swaps.

**INDUSTRY**

**Global Pharmaceutical Industry Overview**

The global pharmaceutical market is a growing industry with growth expected to be driven primarily by
important sector growth trends such as an aging population in the world’s developed economies, the
launch of new and enhanced treatment options for patients, and the increasing significance of emerging
markets.

The United States is the largest pharmaceutical market globally, contributing approximately 46% to total
pharmaceutical sales in 2016. Historically there has been a favorable pricing environment and a generally
higher utilization of pharmaceuticals in the United States, compared to other developed markets. Europe
is the second largest market with Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy (the ‘‘EU5’’)
contributing approximately 15% to total pharmaceutical sales and Japan is the third largest pharmaceutical
market contributing 8%. China and the rest of the world (‘‘RoW’’) market total 31% of pharmaceutical
sales.

**Product Segments**

The pharmaceutical industry is comprised of a broad range of product segments including patent-protected
branded prescription drugs, generic prescription drugs, OTC products and nutraceutical products. Patentprotected branded prescription drugs include both chemical pharmaceutical products and biologics.
Generic prescription drugs include simple generics, branded generics, specialty generics and biosimilars.

**_Patent-Protected Branded Prescription Drugs_**

Patent-protected Branded prescription drugs involve a significant commitment of time and money in
research and development (‘‘R&D’’) and depend upon patent protection laws to recuperate the significant
initial investment and to compensate for other drugs in the pipeline that were unsuccessful. They are sold
under branded names and can be either chemical pharmaceuticals, which are chemically synthesized small
molecules, or biologics, which are large complex molecules extracted from a variety of natural sources
(human, animal or microorganism) and are used to treat a range of diseases and medical conditions.
Examples of biologics include vaccines, gene therapies and cellular therapies.

**_Generic Prescription Drugs_**

Generic drugs are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of reference branded prescription drugs,
typically sold under their generic chemical names at prices below those of their branded drug equivalent.
These drugs can be introduced into the market once patents and regulatory exclusivity have expired on a
given branded prescription drug, and are generally required to meet similar governmental standards as
their branded name equivalent and also must generally receive regulatory approval prior to their sale.
Governments, in an effort to control rising healthcare costs, are increasingly mandating the use of generic

141


-----

drugs instead of the more expensive branded equivalents as they often provide similar benefits after
passing through the approval process.

**_Simple Generics_**

Simple generic drugs are marketed and sold using only the generic chemical name (International
Nonproprietary Name (‘‘INN’’)) and are not given a brand name.

**_Branded Generics_**

Branded generic drugs are marketed under another company’s specific brand name which is different to
the brand name of the original product.

**_Specialty Generics_**

Specialty generics differ from original products in terms of their formulation or method of delivery. They
sometimes require a new drug application to obtain regulatory approvals. These drugs are enhanced in
terms of drug delivery, manufacture, or reformulation technology, and face a more stringent regulatory
approval process than generic prescription drugs. They may also be referred to as added value generics,
new therapeutic entities, or hybrids. Specialty generics take at least three to four years to be developed for
registration.

**_Biosimilars_**

Biosimilars are an emerging class of biologic drugs. While generics are based on chemically synthesized
small molecules that are identical to their branded originator counterpart on an atomic scale, biologics are
based on large and complex molecules extracted from natural sources and are therefore very difficult to
replicate. However, manufacturers have been able to create molecules that are highly similar to approved
original molecule biologics and to obtain regulatory approval. These molecules are offered at a more
affordable price and are referred to as biosimilars. Biosimilar drugs can be thought of as the generic
versions of biologics and are generally required to have no clinically meaningful differences to the original
molecule biologics in order to obtain regulatory approval.

**_OTC Drugs_**

OTC or non-prescription medicine can be purchased by a consumer without the supervision of a health
care professional such as a physician and without a prescription. OTC drugs are tried and tested products
which have been in the market for many years and are not typically protected by patents but rely on brands
to differentiate the products. As there are very few truly global OTC brands, there is a prevalence of local
market leaders. As a result, local brands have the potential to be successful in niche markets.

**_Nutraceutical Products_**

Nutraceuticals are foods or food extracts that are used for medical benefits, and often come in the form of
a dietary supplement. The increasing trend for ‘‘natural’’ products can be seen across consumer segments,
and is also taking place in the pharmaceutical industry due to increased focus on general wellness and
healthier lifestyles. Products based on naturally sourced active ingredients can have the same
pharmaceutical effectiveness as standard pharmaceutical products, often with better safety profiles and
more limited side effects.

**Industry Dynamics & Drivers**

There are a number of fundamental characteristics and trends that have historically impacted, and which
we believe will continue to impact, the growth of the broader pharmaceutical industry over the mid-to
long-term.

**_Resilient, Non-Cyclical Industry_**

The pharmaceutical market is resilient and largely non-cyclical. Spending on prescription and OTC drugs
is non-discretionary in nature and has historically increased throughout a variety of cyclical periods.
Demand within the pharmaceutical market is driven by widespread global demand for improved
healthcare standards, rising disease awareness and consistent investment in scientific innovation and
subsequent introduction of new products and treatment regimes.

142


-----

**_Aging World Population_**

Older individuals have a wider variety and consistency of health care needs and generally consume a
greater proportion of healthcare spend and pharmaceutical products than younger people, particularly for
the treatment of chronic diseases. According to the United Nations, the median age in the world is
projected to rise from approximately 29 years in 2013 to approximately 36 years by 2050, with the median
age in Europe projected to rise from approximately 41 years in 2013 to approximately 46 years by 2050.
Furthermore, the percentage of the population aged 50 years and older is projected to increase by 4.9%
from 2015 to 2030.

**_Innovation Addressing Previously Unmet Medical Needs and Enhanced Treatment Options for Existing_**
**_Patients_**


New medicines are expected to transform patient care in connection with a large number of diseases,
including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as oncology, immunology and central nervous
system disorders, requiring increasing amounts of R&D expenditures. According to the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, the pharmaceutical industry invested more than
A30.5 billion in R&D in Europe in 2014, compared to R&D expenditures of A7.8 billion in 1990,
representing an increase of almost four times.

**_Pharmaceutical Products Provide Cost-Effective Healthcare Spend Alternatives_**


Compared to other healthcare measures such as hospitalization and surgery, pharmaceutical products
contribute a relatively small share to total healthcare spending and thus are a cost-effective measure for
healthcare payors for the management of diseases.

**_Pharmaceutical Cost Containment in Developed Markets_**


Government austerity measures, especially in the Eurozone, are resulting in the tightening of
reimbursement policies and increasing pressure on the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for
their products. Furthermore, reductions in overall health care spending by governments has led to an
increased focus on cost effective alternatives, including generic prescription products and preventive
medicine through more frequent consumption of OTC products.

**_Lifestyle Changes_**


In the developed markets, an increase in the consumption of unhealthy foods combined with a general
trend towards a more sedentary lifestyle has led to an increase in ailments such as diabetes, heart disease,
high cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity. This has led to an increased demand for pharmaceutical
products designed to treat and prevent these conditions and an increase in demand for neutraceutical
products and vitamins. Notably, this trend is also becoming increasingly apparent in emerging markets.

**_Health Insurance and Increase in Disposable Income_**

The significant growth in disposable household income in both developed and emerging markets and the
expansion of health insurance coverage is expected to drive increased access and demand for both
prescription pharmaceuticals and OTC products. This has led for example, to an increased demand for
cough, cold and allergy products.

**_Increasing Role of Emerging Markets_**

According to Quintiles IMS, emerging markets are expected to account for a large portion of overall
growth in the pharmaceutical industry in the coming years. For example, in the generics industry, Central
Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Serbia
are expected to grow at an average CAGR of 5.8% in 2016-2020, while Russia and Ukraine are expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, for the same period. This is higher than the
anticipated growth of developed Western European countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland where the average generics industry CAGR for
2016-2020 is expected to be 4.3% (source: BMI Research). Overall economic activity in emerging markets
is expected to grow in line with rising disposable incomes, rising life expectancy and increased access to
medical care. Compared to more mature markets, emerging markets tend to have a larger proportion of
branded generics products and have health care systems that promote higher levels of ‘‘out-of-pocket’’
spending by the consumer.


**Industry Structure**

The broader global pharmaceutical industry can be grouped into five categories, each addressing different
market segments as described below:


**_Integrated, Global Pharmaceutical Companies_**

These are typically global pharmaceutical companies that are involved in all aspects of the pharmaceutical
value chain from early stage compound discovery, research and development to the sale and marketing of


144


-----

the pharmaceutical product. The high failure rates and costs associated with discovering and developing a
compound in the laboratory through to successful commercialization leads most global pharmaceutical
companies to focus their efforts on the development and commercialization of a limited number of
blockbuster drugs in their portfolio so as to achieve an acceptable level of profitability.

**_Specialty Pharmaceutical Companies_**

These are typically small to medium-sized pharmaceutical companies focused either on specific
geographies or therapeutic areas. Geographic-focused pharmaceutical companies focus primarily on the
marketing and distribution of drugs within selected regions where they have developed a strong sales force
presence. These companies often have broad product portfolios and strong national or regional
distribution networks. Therefore, geographic-focused pharmaceutical companies tend to be less at risk
from the failure of any single product or any single market and, unlike global pharmaceutical companies,
focus their efforts on small and medium value drugs. Specialty drug-focused therapeutic pharmaceutical
companies instead focus on specific therapeutic areas across the value chain. These companies typically
seek to have a multi-national presence in their particular niche product markets.

**_Biotechnology Companies_**

Biotechnology companies focus on new drug discoveries based on biological processes and are generally
engaged in the early stages of the value chain. These companies rely on their technological expertise, and
only the larger companies have developed sales and marketing capabilities. Biotechnology companies often
seek to bring their products to market through partnerships and alliances with larger pharmaceutical
companies which have established sales and marketing functions. Biotechnology companies are growing in
importance as they are increasingly responsible for the discovery of new drugs.

**_Generic Pharmaceutical Companies_**

Generic pharmaceutical companies focus on the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products which
are no longer patent-protected. These companies do not typically engage in the research and development
of new products and seek to maintain profitability by focusing on low cost and high volume production.

**_Consumer Healthcare Companies_**

Consumer healthcare and OTC companies focus on the manufacture and sale of products that meet health
needs but do not require prescriptions. Despite varying definitions of consumer healthcare, it is generally
considered to be made up of any consumer good in which health related claims can be made including:
OTC medicines, personal hygiene, oral care, food & beverage, nutritional products, women’s health, infant
care products and nutraceuticals. These markets are characterized by significantly lower levels of
regulation and government involvement, generally not being reimbursable under government-backed
healthcare schemes. The consumer healthcare market and companies are very focused on brands, with a
correlation between profitability and the contribution of leading brands to companies’ portfolios both
globally and locally. OTC drugs account for the largest portion of the consumer healthcare market,
followed closely by vitamins and dietary supplements.

**Regulation**

The global pharmaceutical industry is extensively regulated by a number of local and international
regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine
Agency. Regulatory requirements and procedures can differ by individual pharmaceutical market, but
include provisions relating to the control of the pharmaceutical markets, manufacturing, research and
clinical development, marketing, labelling and packaging, storage, distribution, dispensing, advertising and
promotion, export and import, and sometimes pricing of pharmaceutical products.

**_European Union_**

The EU pharmaceutical industry regulations require that medicinal products, including generic versions of
previously approved products and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved
products, must receive a marketing authorization before they can be placed on the market in the EU.
There are three main procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in
the EU member states: the Centralized Procedure, the Mutual Recognition Procedure, and the

145


-----

Decentralized Procedure. It is also possible to obtain a pure national authorization for products intended
for commercialization in a single EU member state only. For more information, see ‘‘Regulation.’’

**Pricing and Reimbursement**

Healthcare is a major focus of governments around the world, with health services consuming a significant
percentage of governments’ budgets. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of
reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs, managed
care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Pharmaceutical prices in developed nations
are predominantly determined by government controlled authorities.

**_Europe_**

The majority of European citizens obtain their healthcare benefits from state-organized programs.
Governments in European nations exert significant control over the cost of care, either through price
controls on prescription drugs, or reimbursement policies for prescription drugs sold within the country.
The following is an overview of the systems in the EU5 countries.

_Germany_

In Germany health insurance has been compulsory since 2009. In 2015, around 89% of the population was
covered by statutory health insurance with around 11% of the population covered by private health
insurance. Statutory health insurance is provided by statutory healthcare funds (Krankenkassen). Through
these funds, citizens have equal access to healthcare benefits from healthcare professionals who are
licensed and provide healthcare services within the statutory healthcare system. For the employed,
membership in the statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless their income rises above an
annually determined threshold (currently A57,600 per year). Previously, Germany did not apply any form of
external price referencing with other countries, and was itself a reference country for many EU member
states. Under the Pharmaceuticals Market Reorganization Act, a revised reimbursement system introduced
in 2014 within the German statutory health insurance, drugs employing new active pharmaceutical
ingredients are allowed to set their prices for the first twelve months post-launch. A cost-benefit analysis is
then launched within three months of introduction by the Institute for Quality and Efficacy in Health Care.
For all drugs employing new active pharmaceutical ingredients, the manufacturer must prove the benefits
over comparable available products, failing which the drug will be added to the existing reference pricing
list. At the end of twelve months, the price of drugs that demonstrate additional benefits can be negotiated
between drug manufacturers and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds.

_United Kingdom_

The UK’s National Health Service (the ‘‘UK NHS’’) was established in 1948 to provide universal
healthcare to all residents. The UK NHS is financed partly by the government and partly from national
insurance premiums, paid at source by employers and employees. Around 11% of the population currently
has some form of private medical insurance. Reimbursements are subject to the Pharmaceutical Price
Regulation Scheme (‘‘PPRS’’), which is a profit framework that allows drug manufacturers a defined
return on capital and profit each year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (‘‘NICE’’)
was established in 1999 to review the cost efficiencies of medicines and discourage their use if their cost
outweighed their benefit. NICE is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of
Health in the United Kingdom.

_France_

France has a social insurance system which provides near universal coverage for patients. The main scheme
(R´egime General) currently provides coverage for close to 90% of the population, and is predominantly
financed through compulsory contributions made by employees and employers. Around 95% of the
population has additional contracts with one of the supplementary sickness funds (including _mutuelles,_
which are not-for-profit providers) which cover private medical insurance and out-of-pocket payments. In
an effort to contain overall healthcare costs, the government closely controls the supply of prescription
drugs in its capacity as both regulator and the industry’s largest customer.

146


-----

_Spain_

In Spain the government’s pricing and reimbursement policy has been focused on cost-containment
measures as it attempts to reduce its financial deficit, despite the fact that prices in Spain are among the
lowest in the European Union. Since 2000, the government has introduced various price cuts, reductions to
wholesale and retail margins and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs. At a central level, the Spanish
government has enacted four royal decree-laws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical
industry by means of price reduction of older pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs and
medical devices, and limitations of the numbers of products eligible for a reimbursement under the
Spanish National Health Service.

_Italy_

In Italy the price setting of medicines reimbursed by the National Health Service (the ‘‘Italian NHS’’) is
regulated at the central level by the Italian Medicines Agency (‘‘AIFA’’), the national regulatory authority.
The Italian health care system is mostly public and, therefore, the price of drugs is determined under strict
Health Technology Assessment processes. The prices of pharmaceuticals’ reimbursements by the Italian
NHS is set through direct negotiation between AIFA and the pharmaceutical companies. The Italian NHS
is largely funded through national and regional taxes, supplemented by co-payments from patients for
pharmaceuticals and outpatient care. Public sources make up approximately 4/5 of total health care
spending, with private spending accounting for approximately 1/5, mainly in the form of out-of-pocket
expenses. In Italy, only small fraction of total health-care expenditure is funded by private health
insurance.

**European Generics Market**

In 2016, the generic drugs market in Europe had A31 billion in net sales. The major markets in Europe,
being Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, are expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately 4.0% for 2017-2021. The graph below illustrates the European generic drug sales by region
for 2016.

The size of the generics market differs widely across the various EU member states driven by various
factors including market conditions for new medicines, pricing/reimbursement structures, prescribing/
dispensing tradition and the prevalence of efforts to encourage generic use. In some member states such as
the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark, generics are promoted and seen as a tool
to contain rising pharmaceutical patent and trademark office costs and as such these member states have
strong generics penetration rates in Europe of around 60-70%. In other markets such as Spain, Belgium
and Italy, where the original pharmaceutical prices are relatively low, brand recognition is high and
generics are not actively prescribed by doctors or promoted by healthcare insurance companies, there is a
much lower level of generics market penetration of around 40-60% (source: Quintiles IMS).

147


-----

There is an increasing policy shift in certain European countries to promote generic prescribing as part of
overall healthcare reforms and to reduce the overall level of pharmaceutical expenditure which will likely
lead to an increase in the level of generics penetration in European markets.

**_Patent Expiry of Top-Selling Drugs_**

The pharmaceutical market is expected to face a large number of patent expirations in the coming years,
offering generic pharmaceutical companies opportunities to capitalize on this market. Furthermore, the
value of the addressable market for generics from key brands losing exclusivity has increased in the
majority of major European countries over the last three years (source: Quintiles IMS).

**_Cost Containment Measures_**

As noted above, many European countries are tightening reimbursement policies and increasing pressure
on the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for their products leading to an increased focus on cost
effective alternatives such as generics and OTC drugs.

**_Increasing Demand in Emerging Markets_**

Emerging markets are expected to generate higher growth in generics and OTC markets than Western
Europe for the period from 2016-2020, with an expected CAGR for Russia, Ukraine and Romania over
this period of 14.1%, 12.7% and 8.0% respectively (source: BMI Research). In addition, Serbia, Slovakia,
Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic are expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% over the same
period (source: BMI Research). This growth is driven by rising disposable incomes, rising life expectancy
and increased access to medical care. Despite having a larger proportion of branded generic and OTC
products than more mature markets, governments in emerging markets are beginning to encourage the use
of more cost-effective alternatives offered in generic drugs.

**Summary Overview of the Five Largest Geographic Markets for STADA**

**_Germany_**

The German generics market had sales of approximately A6.7 billion in 2016 and has one of the highest
levels of generic penetration of nearly 76% in 2016. Germany has adopted key price saving measures and a
high price discount for generics, by a combination of reference pricing rebates, mandatory substitution,
reimbursement shifts, and a well-established public tendering system which covers the majority of generic
sales. The generics market is relatively fragmented with the top five players in Germany representing
approximately 52% of the overall generics market. The German generics market showed growth of 4.3% in
2013-2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% in 2017 to 2021 (source: Quintiles IMS, BMI
Research).

OTC products represent an important product category in Germany representing approximately 35% of
overall market revenues where brand recognition is important to consumers. The OTC market in Germany
had sales of approximately A5.3 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.5% in 2017-2021,
based on data received from Quintiles IMS. OTC products are not reimbursed by public health insurances
but are paid for directly by the customers who continue to be influenced by brand recognition. In

Germany, OTC products are available in pharmacies, supermarkets and via online retailing. The OTC
market is relatively consolidated with the top five players representing approximately 70% of the market
(source: BMI Research).

**_Russia_**

The Russian market had sales of approximately A2.5 billion for 2016 and has a relatively high level of
generic penetration of approximately 72% as of 2016.

The government funded segment covering hospitals and the Additional Medicines Supply Program (the
‘‘DLO’’), which represents approximately 31% of the market, with purchasing largely conducted by tenders
with the government looking for the lowest price, and with a strong preference for local producers. The
majority of the market (approximately 66%) is driven by retail sales (largely via pharmacies) which is an
out-of-pocket market paid for directly by patients and consumers. Branded generics and OTC products
dominate the out-of-pocket market with INNs representing a very small share of the market. The state
funded segment is expected to lag behind retail due to the expected freeze of budget growth and
localization effects, with the retail sector expected to continue to drive the majority of the overall market
growth with the consumer health market growing faster than the prescription market.

The Russian generics market is one of the most fragmented markets in Europe with the top five players by
sales controlling approximately 17% of the market in 2014. The Russian market grew at a CAGR of 15.1%
between 2013 and 2016, and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 6.0% in 2017 to 2021.

The OTC market in Russia has sales of approximately A3.8 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a
CAGR of 5.6% in 2017 to 2021—faster than the majority of Western European countries despite the
recent trends in reduced disposable income. The majority of OTC products are non-reimbursable with
OTC almost fully covered from out-of-pocket spend by consumers. Currently, OTC products are only
available in pharmacies with no other mass market channels such as grocery stores or supermarkets and as
such physician and pharmacist recommendations are key sales drivers for OTC products.

The Russian OTC market is relatively consolidated with the top five players in the Russian OTC market
representing approximately 70% of the market in 2014 (source: Quintiles IMS).

**_Italy_**

The Italian generics market had sales of approximately A3.6 billion for 2016 and has one of the lowest
levels of generic penetration in Europe of approximately 48% as of 2016 and an average level of pricing
discount as a result of a high level of brand awareness and use of branded generics.

In Italy, a mandatory 50% price discount is applied to public providers of generic pharmaceuticals
approved under national registration procedures, with wholesalers of generic pharmaceuticals restricted to
a regulated margin of 3% for wholesalers of generic pharmaceuticals. Tenders are only used for
procurement for public institutions such as hospitals. Physicians are free to indicate a specific brand of
pharmaceutical to avoid generic substitution if they explicitly give reasons for the choice, but pharmacies
are required to dispense a cheaper generic instead of a branded drug if not ruled out by a physician and if
available. Patients can also opt to co-pay for a reimbursed pharmaceutical if the price being charged for the
branded product is above the reference price.

The Italian generics market is relatively fragmented with the top five players by sales controlling
approximately 32% of the market in 2014. Given the high level of brand awareness, the pharmacist and
patient have the most influence on the purchasing decision. The Italian generics market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of 4.4% in 2017-2021 (source: Quintiles IMS).

The Italian OTC market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3% in 2017 to 2021. The Italian market is
generally flat in terms of volume growth while the limited growth in terms of value is substantially
determined by price increases. In addition, the market is concentrated in a limited number of players.
Tenders are only used for procurement for public institutions such as hospitals. Physicians prescribing an
off-patent drugs are required to specify the active ingredient and in addition they can add the name of the
brand or the INN. Pharmacists are required to dispense the cheapest product according to the
‘‘Transparency List,’’ unless patients choose to co-pay in order to obtain a more expensive brand.

-----

**_United Kingdom_**

The UK generics market had sales of approximately A5.4 billion in 2016 and has one of the highest levels of
generic penetration in Europe of approximately 70% in 2016.

The PPRS does not apply to generic versions of a pharmaceutical, which relies on competitive pricing
dynamics and allows free pricing for generic pharmaceuticals as long as the price is below that of the
patented original drug. Reimbursement is regulated at the retail level for Category M generics products
(approximately 90% of generics products) based on a calculation that incorporates the volume-weighted
average price charged by manufacturers.

The UK is a mature and highly genericized market with the highest overall level of price discounting in
Europe (approximately 75%) as a result of the concentrated buying power of the NHS, although there is a
limited use of tenders in the UK market outside of hospitals and government tenders on vaccines for
national immunization schedules. Wholesalers are the key decision makers in the purchasing decision as
both physicians and pharmacists prescribe and order only by the generic name.

The UK generics market is relatively fragmented with the top five players by sales controlling
approximately 42% of the market in 2014. The UK generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of
2.2% in 2017 to 2021.

The OTC market in the United Kingdom represented sales of approximately A1.7 billion in 2016 and is
expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3% in 2017 to 2021. The majority of OTC products are non-reimbursable
and there is a low level of regulation in the UK market, particularly as the UK is a pioneer of switching
established and well known prescription products to OTC. The nature to self-medicate is extremely
prevalent in the UK, with product choice heavily influenced by a high level of in-store promotion and
direct-to-consumer advertising. Grocery retail stores, supermarkets and pharmacies remain the major
channels for the distribution of OTC products in the United Kingdom with online retailing growing slowly.
The UK OTC market is relatively consolidated with the top five players representing approximately 75%
of the market (source: Quintiles IMS).

**_Spain_**

The Spanish generics market had sales of approximately A3.0 billion for 2016 and has a relatively low level
of generic penetration of approximately 61% as of 2016.

Prices and margins for prescription drugs are tightly regulated. Recent pricing reform implemented in
Spain expects all pharmaceutical prices (including both original drug and generics drugs) to equalize, with
the government unlikely to reimburse products that do not reduce the list prices compared to the generics.
While price is the most important factor in the Spanish generics market, pharmacists still have a relatively
strong decision-making power as a result of the fragmented pharmacy landscape in the country.

Pharmaceutical margins on generics are tightly regulated for both pharmacies and wholesalers, although
there is a limited use of tenders in the Spanish market except for certain regions (e.g. Andalusia) with
pharmaceutical companies typically contracting centrally with the regional authorities.

The Spanish generics market is relatively fragmented with the top five players by sales controlling
approximately 38% of the market in 2014. The Spanish market grew at a CAGR of 6.5% between 2013 and
2016, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.2% in 2017 to 2021 (source: Quintiles IMS).

In Spain, OTC products account for a relatively small proportion of the overall market compared to
prescription pharmaceuticals and generics, with total OTC revenues of approximately A645 million and is
expected to grow at a CAGR of less than 1% from 2017 to 2021.

_Generics:_ Through our Generics segment, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost
alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in
our Generics segment require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and
hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with
competition driven by reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expiries of originator drugs
feed our product pipeline in the Generics segment, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and
local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics segment is
diversified, with the top ten products accounting for only 17% of sales in our Generics segment for the year
ended December 31, 2016. The top-five selling products (and their respective therapeutic areas) in our
Generics segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, were: Tilidine Naloxone (pain relief),
Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Pantoprazol (gastric ulcers/reflux), Epoetin zeta (anemia) and Diclofenac (pain
relief/inflammation). The largest countries by sales in our Generics segment for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Russia, France, Serbia and Vietnam. We generated
sales of A1,328 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A286 million in our Generics segment for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

_Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products segment primarily includes branded OTC products, which are
typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests,
cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands

include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-Go (Parkinson’s
disease). The market for products in our Branded Products segment is generally characterized by marketdriven pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty important factors for success.
Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top ten products accounting for only 31% of
sales in our Branded Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016. The top-five selling brands
(and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in
our Branded Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, were: APO-Go (Parkinson’s
disease, prescription required, available in 31 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in
29 countries), Snup (rhinitis, OTC, available in 18 countries), Fultium (vitamin D deficiency, OTC,
available in two countries) and Vitaprost (prostate disease, OTC, available in two countries). The largest
countries by sales in our Branded Products segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, were:
Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Vietnam. We generated sales of A920 million and
Management Adjusted EBITDA of A214 million in our Branded Products segment for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2017.

**Our Strengths**

**_Organic Growth Underpinned by Attractive Market Fundamentals_**

Increasing demand for our Generics and Branded Products is driven by global growth factors in the
pharmaceutical industry, including population growth, aging societies, increased incidence of chronic
disease, advances in medical therapies and increasing self-medication and health awareness. According to
Quintiles IMS, the global generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% from 2017 to 2021, driven
by these growth trends and increasing generics penetration. Generics penetration in the market for
prescription products is partly driven by cost-containment regulation that incentivizes the use of generics to
counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs. Another key driver
of generics penetration is patent expiries. According to publicly available estimates, a wave of patent
expiries in developed markets is expected to push originator products with sales of more than $140 billion
in aggregate into the generics market between 2017 and the end of 2020.

Given that our Branded Products segment mostly consists of OTC products, growth in this segment is
additionally driven by factors influencing the self-payment and self-care market for health and well-beingrelated products. We expect demand for self-payment and self-care products to benefit from the ongoing
trend among regulators to transfer prescription drugs to OTC status, which decreases the cost burden on
the public health system and expands the market opportunity for companies offering branded OTC
products such as us. Additionally, demand for OTC products is expected to be driven by rising income
levels and the emerging trend toward greater health awareness, which we believe results from ongoing
research on disease prevention, data access and increasing levels of education. According to Quintiles IMS,
the global OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2017 to 2021.

**_Well-Established Generics Player with Leading Positions in Our Generics Segment and an Attractive Portfolio_**
**_in Our Branded Products Segment_**

We are the fourth-largest generics company by sales in Europe as of September 30, 2016. In our Generics
segment, based on Quintiles IMS data, we hold a top-three market share in generics sales for the year
ended December 31, 2016, in Germany, Russia, Spain and Belgium, and are the fourth-largest player in
Italy. Even though these markets are generally considered mature, there is significant room for increased
penetration and further growth in generics in these markets—for example, according to Quintiles IMS,
generics penetration is below 50% in Italy and Belgium, below 65% in Spain and below 75% in France, and
the generics industry in Germany, Spain and Russia is expected to increase by a CAGR of 5%, 5% and 6%
from 2017 to 2021, respectively. Continued growth in the generics industry in countries where we are
already market-leaders provides us an opportunity to continue to grow sales in our Generics segment.

We also benefit from an attractive portfolio of products in our Branded Products segment, including the
category-leading therapies for cough and cold, sun protection, vitamin deficiency and many leading brands
across therapeutic areas in Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and other countries. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, more than two-thirds of sales of our top-30 products in our Branded Products segment
were of products with a top-three market position in their respective countries. Many of these leading
products have been category leaders in their respective markets for many years, providing us with an
opportunity to leverage our local marketing expertise to drive the internationalization of these leading
brands into new markets and further grow sales in our Branded Products segment.

**_Competitive Advantage Through Scale, Local Market Expertise and Established Relationships_**

Our market-leading position provides us with a competitive advantage over any new entrants in our
markets, bolstered by our scale and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market
expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies.

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated
in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly-fragmented, competitors trying to enter a
new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement
regimes and distribution channels. This provides an advantage to existing, large scale players with a long
history of local expertise, such as us. We are highly familiar with the regulatory requirements in our key
markets and have developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory and distribution issues, which
enables us to minimize the time and cost required to obtain regulatory product approvals while maximizing
the number of countries we cover.

Germany, for example, operates a public tender system that covers the majority of prescription generic
sales, which necessitates a modestly sized sales team with significant tender experience. In Russia, on the
other hand, the distribution of prescription generics products is mostly patient-driven after the first
prescription, which significantly increases the need for a larger sales force targeting patients indirectly via
doctors. Our local market experience means that we are adept at navigating these and other regimes and
able to serve each market with a tailored sales and distribution approach. Building on our long history and
our origins as a pharmacy cooperative, we have developed deeply-ingrained relationships with the key
distribution channels in our markets, which we believe are difficult to replicate. Our sales forces are
trained and experienced in identifying the right marketing strategy in each country, and we maintain a
direct sales presence in more than 30 countries, which allows us to stay close to our customers and
distributors and internationalize successful brands.

**_Diversified Across Geographies, Therapeutic Areas, Products and Brands_**

We are diversified across geographic markets, products, therapeutic areas, customers and suppliers. We
market our products in approximately 125 countries with largely uncorrelated end-markets, with our five
largest markets in our Generics segment accounting for 58% of our sales and our five largest markets in
our Branded Products segment accounting for 68% of sales in their respective segments, in each case for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

With more than 18,000 SKUs, we offer a highly-diversified product portfolio and are not dependent on the
success of any single product. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the top ten products by sales in our
Generics segment accounted for only 17% of Generics sales, and the top ten products in the Branded
Products segment accounted for only 31% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering is diversified
across a large number of therapeutic areas and benefits from a high rate of new product launches, with a
strong pipeline for the next four to five years.

The combination of our Generics and Branded Products segments provides us with significant benefits in
terms of diversification and synergies. The pricing of prescription generics is regulated, and volume
demand is relatively independent of economic conditions, such that our Generics business has historically
delivered strong and stable sales and cash generation. Our Branded Products segment, on the other hand,
faces fewer regulatory requirements. OTC products can be brought to the market more quickly, and
pricing is unregulated and driven by competition. As a result, our highly-recognizable brands, customer
loyalty and the lack of competition in certain specialty areas provide for attractive pricing for products in
our Branded Products segment. Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond
relatively quickly to emerging consumer trends. Our presence in both segments allows us to deepen our
local market expertise and regulatory know-how, exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and
marketing and maintain our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.

**_Diversified and Efficient Manufacturing Footprint Across the Globe_**

We have a cost-effective manufacturing footprint that is diversified across 19 manufacturing sites. Our own
production facilities account for approximately 70% of our sales, with the balance being outsourced.
Furthermore, approximately 75% of our in-house production volume is manufactured in lower-cost
countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and
highly flexible production base.

153


-----

Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, with 14 of our sites being
accredited under stringent EU standards. Moreover, local production helps provide a natural hedge for
currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products
in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our
margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to further streamline and improve
certain aspects of our manufacturing operations.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Cash Flow Generation_**

We have a stable underlying business that has delivered consistent sales growth and resulted in high cash
flow generation in recent years. Our constant-currency sales increased at a CAGR of 4% from
December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2017. We had Cash Conversion of 83%, 74% and 76% for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. While our Management Adjusted EBITDA margins have
been relatively stable (21%, 18%, 19% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016
and the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, respectively), we see significant upside in our ability to drive
cost savings and increase our margins, which we believe can be further improved. Pro forma for the cost
savings we expect to realize by the end of 2018, our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, was 23%. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing
liquidity requirements. We have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital
movements, and management has maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a
company focused on generics, we typically incur limited development expenses and no material research
expenses.

**_Highly Committed Sponsors with Key Management Support_**

We intend to draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our
Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive
and successful track record of investing in companies in the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital
increased sales by 49% within two years and significantly increased the workforce at Bio Products
Laboratory, creating a life sciences champion in the United Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large
laboratory diagnostics companies, Synlab (Germany) and Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form
Synlab Group (headquartered in Germany), the new European champion in laboratory diagnostics. In
addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury Pharma and Amdipharm and merged the two businesses to
create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented generics market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy
centered on continued buy and build, further internationalization and applying best practice across both
companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to TSX/Nasdaq-listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion
in 2015. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margin,
while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both organically and through targeted
acquisitions.

In addition, the Sponsors have announced their intention to appoint Dr. Claudio Albrecht as new chief
executive officer and Mr. Mark Keatley as new chief financial officer of STADA, following the
reconstitution of the Target’s supervisory board (the ‘‘Supervisory Board’’). Both Dr. Albrecht and
Mr. Keatley have significant experience in the global generics industry, where they have led highly
successful growth strategies at major corporations. Dr. Albrecht was chief executive officer and chairman
of generics company Actavis Group until its sale to Watson in 2012. Under his leadership, Actavis grew its
revenues to more than A2 billion and expanded its international footprint significantly. Previously, he had
been chief executive officer of Ratiopharm Group, having started his career in the generics business of
Sandoz. Mr. Keatley served as chief financial officer of Actavis Group until its sale in 2012. He also has
strong expertise in managing growth and transformation strategies in the generics industry and beyond.
Previously he was chief financial officer of Famar, a European contract manufacturer for the healthcare
industry. He has also worked in medical diagnostic services, investment banking and private equity.
Dr. Albrecht and Mr. Keatley have most recently worked at Albrecht, Prock & Partners, a global strategy
consulting firm with a focus on the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. There, they advised on
multiple major engagements in the generics and broader healthcare sector, including supporting Bain
Capital and Cinven during the due diligence process in connection with the Takeover Offer. Dr. Albrecht is
expected to lead STADA’s transition under its new majority owners in the short-to-medium term and to
assume a non-executive leadership role in due course, once a new CEO has been recruited who will lead
STADA in the long term. See ‘‘—Recent Developments.’’

-----

In the interim, we expect to benefit from the significant industry experience and expertise of our interim
CEO Mr. Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink, a 25-year veteran of the pharmaceutical industry, and our
interim CFO Dr. Bernhard D¨uttmann, previously CFO of two DAX-listed companies, as they guide the
Target together with the Supervisory Board through the current phase of the Target’s transition. Chief
technical operations officer, Dr. Barthold Piening, previously chief operating officer at Acino
International, will also continue in his role on the Target’s executive board (the ‘‘Executive Board’’). The
Target also continues to benefit from its deep bench of operational management, which will continue to
bring to bear its deep local experience with global scale and expertise.

**Our Strategy**

We and the Sponsors have developed the following strategies:

**_Maintain and Grow Market Leading Positions by Leveraging Scale, Highly-Recognizable Brands and Industry_**
**_Growth Factors_**

As an established market leader, we intend to continue to use our scale and highly-recognizable brands to
reinforce and grow our leading market positions in the key countries and categories in which we operate.
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from global growth factors in the pharmaceutical
industry, and as a large player highly diversified across geographies, products and brands and production,
we intend to continue to leverage our scale and broad local expertise to support our base business, improve
our margins and expand our geographic footprints along with the markets in which we operate.

**_Continue to Grow Our Business, Including by Internationalizing Successful Brands in Our Branded Products_**
**_Segment_**

The products in our Generics segment comprise our core business, providing us with a stable sales base
and strong cash generation. We see significant potential to expand sales growth in this segment by
expanding in markets with relatively low penetration rates and supplementing our existing portfolio with
biosimilars, while also benefiting from global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry.

At the same time, we intend to build on our key brands and to grow our Branded Products segment by
strengthening our market shares in our existing geographies and introducing our local category leaders into
new, international markets. Our intention is to continue to gradually increase the percentage of sales and
EBITDA generated by our Branded Products segment. In addition, we plan to continue developing
products for specialty areas, which tend to benefit from attractive pricing, to further expand the scope and
improve the profitability of our Branded Products segment. We also intend to selectively explore
acquisitions that provide attractive opportunities to grow.

**_Increase Profitability by Continuing and Expanding Upon Management’s Strategic Cost Savings Initiatives_**

Our management has devised, and the Sponsors intend to continue and expand upon the implementation
of, certain cost savings initiatives from which we expect to derive significant cost savings and improve our
margins. By the end of the year 2018, we expect run-rate annualized savings of approximately A82 million
per year to arise from these cost savings initiatives. In terms of cost of sales, management has put in place
initiatives to improve direct product procurement by renegotiating supply contracts with our highly
fragmented supply base and to create operational improvements in manufacturing through insourcing
certain third-party manufactured products and streamlining product lines, while also improving our supply
chain setup and organization through hub, route and order size optimization. To achieve these cost savings
we intend to create technology centers of excellence, roll out an operating expense / lean project
management program and reduce our SKU complexity. For general and administrative expenses, we
believe we can achieve cost savings by unifying our IT landscape across our footprint through consolidating
IT systems and contracts, reducing non-personnel general and administrative spending and optimizing
advisory and supervisory board costs, while also optimizing our sales force structures by streamlining our
legal entities. We expect to incur A70 million in upfront costs to achieve these cost saving initiatives.

**_Maintain Financial Discipline to Support Deleveraging_**

We intend to maintain a high focus on continuing improvement in cash flows, supported by, among other
things, rapid EBITDA growth resulting from management’s and the Sponsors’ cost savings initiatives on
top of global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry. For our business, which benefits from
significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in

155


-----

capital expenditures broadly in line with historical capital expenditures. We expect improved cash flows
and discipline in capital expenditures to provide a strong liquidity cushion for our ongoing business needs,
which will be further bolstered by our A400 million Revolving Credit Facility and the long-dated maturity
profile of our other debt. In terms of risk management, we are partly naturally hedged for transaction
currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the same country as the end consumer,
but we also intend to continue to implement exchange rate hedging policies through natural hedge
strategies and derivatives. As a result, we believe that the successful execution of our strategies will allow
us to progressively de-lever and further improve cash flow generation. Notwithstanding our intention to
de-lever and our focus on organic growth, we also intend to selectively consider acquisition opportunities
as and when they arise.

**Our History**

Our historical roots can be traced back to a pharmacist’s cooperative founded in 1895 in Dresden,
Germany, when a group of pharmacists started manufacturing pharmaceutical products under the name
Standardarzneimittel Deutscher Apotheker. Over the course of our history of over 120 years we have
leveraged our sustainable approach to business and a strategy geared for the long-term to expand from a
small pharmaceutical undertaking focused on its domestic German market, into a leading player in the
international healthcare and pharmaceutical market:

- In 1957, we transferred our headquarters to its current location in Bad Vilbel.

- Shortly thereafter, in 1961, we started shifting our manufacturing activities from local production by
our member pharmacies to centralized production facilities in Bad Vilbel.

- At the beginning of 1970, we converted our corporate form from a cooperative into a corporation to
facilitate capital formation for our future expansion.

- In 1975, we expanded our product portfolio by venturing into the nascent generics market.

- In 1986, we leveraged our access to capital and began our expansion into international markets, first
through the purchase of subsidiaries in our neighboring countries, Switzerland and Austria, and later
through acquisitions in Asia, including Hong Kong in 1992.

- In 1996, we acquired ALIUD PHARMA GmbH in Germany, which allowed us to expand our generics
portfolio to a second, separate product line. In the following year, we branched out further into the
Czech Republic and France.

- In October 1997, we consummated our initial public offering (IPO) and listed our shares for official
trading on the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and D¨usseldorf. Within less than five years of our IPO,
our shares were included in the renowned MDAX segment of the Deutsche Boerse Group. Today, our
shares are listed on Xetra and the stock exchanges of Frankfurt, Berlin, D¨usseldorf, Hamburg,
Hannover, Munich and Stuttgart.

- As of 2005, we accelerated our international expansion and acquired companies in Thailand, Ireland,
the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Russia, Portugal and Serbia. In addition, we purchased several
portfolios of Branded Products, as well as the rights to individual Branded Products.

- In 2006, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of A1 billion.

- The introduction of Silapo in 2008, a pharmaceutical product used to treat anemia resulting from
chronic kidney failure and chemotherapy, marks our first commercialization of a biosimilar. In the
following years, we began in-licensing biosimilars from highly specialized suppliers, in order to
develop our biosimilars portfolio in a cost-effective way.

- In 2013, we moved into the field of individualized drug therapy with the introduction of multiple DNA
tests, and thereby developed our diagnostic portfolio. Over the course of the year the offering was
expanded into a diverse range of self-tests. Furthermore, with the acquisition of the British OTC
supplier Thornton & Ross, we took another step in developing our increasingly important Branded
Products portfolio.

- In 2014, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of A2 billion.

**Our Products**

**_Overview_**

_Generics and Branded Products_

We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company, which develops, manufactures
and markets branded and unbranded generics. Generics are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of
reference branded originator drugs and can be introduced into the market once the patents on the
originator drugs have expired. Despite their high quality, generics are substantially less expensive than the
originator products because the original research costs and clinical trials do not have to be repeated.

In our Generics segment, we sell unbranded generics mostly comprised of prescription products, thereby
offering a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more expensive originator products. In most countries,
the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly or indirectly through reimbursement rates
payable by the health insurance system. Unbranded generics are typically labelled with the name of their
manufacturer and marketed under the chemical name of their active pharmaceutical ingredient. The
chemical name is also referred to as the generic name or INN. Examples of unbranded generics that we
market under their chemical name include Tilidine Naloxone (pain relief) and Atorvastatin (elevated
cholesterol levels).

Our range of Branded Products is diverse. It mainly includes branded generics that can be sold
over-the-counter, which are also referred to as branded OTC or non-prescription products. OTC products
can be purchased without the supervision of a healthcare professional such as a physician, and without a
prescription. Examples include sunscreens, cough and cold medicines and pain relievers. Additionally, our
Branded Products portfolio features non-generic pharmaceutical products, such as DNA tests, cosmetics,
glucose meters and vaping products. Lastly, our range of Branded Products comprises a small range of
branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands include Ladival (OTC), Grippostad (OTC) and
Covonia (OTC) and APO-Go (prescription). OTC drugs are tried and tested products which have been in
the market for many years and are not typically protected by patents but rely on brands to differentiate the
products. Prices of Branded Products are much more flexible than those of Generics and can be set on the
basis of the competitive advantage a product has over its competitors.

_Categorization_

Whether products are categorized into the Generics or Branded Products segment depends on our
marketing strategy. Marketing of prescription generics is generally price-driven, and where we decide to
compete mainly on that basis and market generics under their chemical name, we classify them into the
Generics segment. In some cases, we assign generics to the Branded Products segment because we are able
to compete on the basis of product quality, brand awareness and brand loyalty among customers, such that
we are able to charge premium prices.

In most countries, our portfolio of Branded Products is predominantly comprised of OTC products such as
Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad (cough and cold) and Aqualor (sinus infection, sore throats). In the
United Kingdom, however, our range of Branded Products also includes major prescription products such
as APO-Go (Parkinson’s disease). Our OTC products and medical devices are globally assigned to the
Branded Products segment.

_Delivery Forms and Packaging_

Our product portfolio comprises a broad range of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, suppositories, dry
powder for reconstitution as suspensions or liquids. We offer a large spectrum of packaging sizes and
various delivery forms, utilizing either immediate or sustained release delivery. We generally do not market
injectables.

_Diversification Across Therapeutic Areas_

Our pharmaceutical product offering is well-diversified across therapeutic areas and focuses on the
following categories: allergies and hay fever; diagnostics; diabetes; coughs and colds; fitness and vitality;
sore throats; skin diseases; cardiovascular diseases; gastrointestinal conditions; muscle and joint
conditions; histamine intolerance; lactose intolerance; stress relief and sleep disorders; menstrual
dysfunction and menopause; pain and fever relief; pregnancy and lactation; sun protection; and metabolic
conditions.

_Diversification Across Products_

With more than 18,000 SKUs on offer, we carry a highly diversified product portfolio. The breadth of our
portfolio also ensures that we are not dependent on the success of any single product, with no single
product accounting for more than 8% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. In the same period,
the top ten products by sales in our Generics segment accounted for only 17% of Generics sales, and the
top ten products in the Branded Products segment accounted for only 31% of Branded Products sales. Our
product offering also benefits from a healthy rate of replenishment. We have released on average 600 new
products (primarily in our Generics segment) per year since 2014, with a strong pipeline for the next four
to five years. See ‘‘—Research and Product Development.’’

_Diversification Across Geographies_

Our SKUs are marketed in 125 largely uncorrelated markets in Europe, the MENA region, Asia, Australia
and the Americas, which provides us with a high degree of diversification across geographies.

**_Our Generics Portfolio_**

_Overview_

In our Generics segment, we sell a well-diversified portfolio of unbranded generics mostly comprised of
prescription products. Generics accounted for A1,280.7 million, or 60%, of our sales in the year ended
December 31, 2016.

_Top Five Generics_

Our portfolio of Generics includes numerous market leaders in mature product categories.

The table below shows our top five Generics products by sales in the year ended December 31, 2016,
including their respective market share and market position in their reference market in major
geographies, according to Quintiles IMS.

**2016 Sales** **2016 Country | Market**

_Competitive Drivers_

With prescription generics pricing regulated, the key determinants of success in most of our Generics
markets are price (particularly where contracts are put out to tender), as well as scale, a competitive cost
structure, local market expertise, established distribution channels, strong relationships with suppliers and
portfolio breadth.

We were the fourth largest generics company in Europe as of September 30, 2016, and the resulting scale
advantage, together with our efficient manufacturing footprint across lower-cost countries, our extensive
local market expertise that we have acquired since our inception in 1895 and our deeply ingrained
relationships with suppliers that we have established over our long history all contribute to this leading
position in the Generics market. As a one-stop-shop, we are also committed to providing a full portfolio in
most of our markets. This gives us a competitive advantage, as customers often request a multitude of
different dosage forms and strengths when placing orders for Generics, which we can reliably supply,
whereas many of our competitors do not have this capability and thus cannot fulfill these orders. The
breadth of our portfolio also helps us to favorably exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and
marketing.

_Key Geographic Markets_

We operate a large prescription drug business in Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia. The
table below shows these markets by Generics sales in the year ended December 31, 2016, including our
market share and market position according to Quintiles IMS:

**2016 Sales** **2016 Market** **2016 Market**

_In-Licensed Products_

With respect to certain patented originator products and biosimilars we have entered into license
agreements with highly specialized, high-profile suppliers under which distribution rights are licensed to us
on attractive commercial terms. Due to our local market expertise, established distribution channels and
geographic reach into approximately 125 countries, we are an in-licensing partner of choice.

In 2015, the number of newly expired patents on biologics in Germany, for the first time ever, exceeded
newly expired patents on chemical-synthetic products, which contributed to the significant increase in the
global generics market from 2014 to 2015. In addition, it is estimated that twelve of the best-selling
biologics in terms of sales will have lost their patent protection by 2020. We believe that this is evidence of
a secular trend toward the increasing importance of biosimilars in the future global generics market, which
is partly due to the fact that biosimilars can be produced at significantly lower cost than the original
biologics. This means that these products can substantially reduce the cost pressure faced by the global
national healthcare markets and insurance carriers. As a result, we are committed to the future growth of
biosimilars and believe that in-licensing constitutes a relatively low-risk and cost-effective step toward
developing our own biosimilars portfolio.

We currently market two biosimilars, SILAPO, an epoetin biosimilar, and Grastofil, a filgrastim product.
In addition, we have in-licensed five further biosimilars, including pegfilgrastim, rituximab, teriparatide,
adalimumab and bevacicumab. We and our cooperation partner also received a positive opinion from the
competent European approval authority, the EMA, for teriparatide at the end of 2016, before approval
was granted by the EU commission in 2017.

We intend to grow our Generics portfolio through the expansion of our offering of biosimilars from two to
seven products by 2020, while continuing to pursue an in-licensing strategy.

**_Our Branded Products Portfolio_**

_Overview_

Our well-diversified portfolio of Branded Products includes, among others, pain relievers, cough and cold
medicine, sunscreens, cosmetics, rhinitis medicine, probiotics and dietary supplements, sleeping aids,
diagnostics, glucose meters, vaping products and branded prescription generics. Branded Products
accounted for A858.5 million, or 40%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2016.

_Pain Relief_

One of the chief categories in our product portfolio is pain relief, and we carry products targeting general
pain, migraines, fever induced pain, toothache, muscle pain, menstrual pain and others. We sell many
delivery forms including tablets, syrups, suspensions and suppositories. Some of our best-known brands
include Mobilat, Ibudolor, Neuranidal and Pfeil.

_Cough and Cold Medicines_

Our product range comprises a wide variety of cough and cold medicines, which can be administered as
effervescent tablets, syrups, sprays, gels and capsules. Our key brands in the category include Grippostad,

159


-----

which ranks first in Germany, Covonia, which is one of the most recognizable brand names in the United
Kingdom, as well as Aqualor with respect to Russia.

_Sunscreens_

We sell sunscreen products in various delivery forms, including creams, sprays, lip balms, and sticks. Our
key brand in the sun protection space is Ladival which is the first-in-class product in Germany in terms of
brand recognition among pharmacists. Many of our competitors’ sunscreen products contain synthetic
compounds derived from petroleum and natural gas (petrochemicals) which are absorbed by the skin. Our
sunscreen offering is differentiated in that it is derived from largely natural sources and free from artificial
fragrances, coloring, petrochemicals and parabens which are known to cause allergies in some cases. In
keeping with this positioning, we distribute our Ladival products exclusively through pharmacies.

_Cosmetics_

Under the Claire Fisher brand, which we acquired in 2014, we market age control products, moisturizers,
exfoliators, creams, tonics, lotions, shower gels and liquid soaps. As in the case of our sunscreen products,
we mainly target health-conscious consumers who are drawn to mostly natural ingredients. Accordingly, we
developed our portfolio in close collaboration with dermatologists and other experts and took great care in
ensuring that all our cosmetics products are free from animal-derived ingredients, nanotechnology,
genetically modified plants, artificial colors, petrochemicals and parabens.

_Rhinitis Medicine_

Rhinitis medicine alleviates the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (commonly known as hay fever). Allergic
rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mold, or flakes
of skin from certain animals. Our most-recognizable brands include Snup, Cetirizin and Loratadin.

_Probiotics and Dietary Supplements_

Our portfolio of Branded Products also includes probiotics and dietary supplements aimed at the
self-improvement market. Examples include vitamin supplements, lactose digestants, magnesium
supplements and immune system boosters.

_Diagnostics_

In our diagnostics business, we market high-quality tests and testing devices both to healthcare
professionals and consumers. We believe this responds to an emerging trend, as consumers are becoming
increasingly health conscious and concerned with disease prevention. Our self-tests can be applied at home
and provide consumers with a quick and simple way to determine whether symptoms they experience may
be a first indication of a new or recurring illness. Our portfolio includes tests to detect colorectal cancer,
iron deficiency, gluten intolerance, bacterial infections and the menopause. Tests offered for professional
use include DNA tests to determine the efficacy of breast cancer therapies and side-effects of
anti-cholesterol therapies, as well as to tailor therapies for myocardial and stroke prophylaxis and
antidepressants to the individual requirements of each patients. In addition, we sell Ebola tests which
provide a quick and reliable check for this disease.

We also offer glucose meters and various accessories to enable diabetic patients to monitor and treat their
illness both at home and on the move.

_Branded Prescription Generics_

In certain cases we assign prescription generics to the Branded Products business. This largely occurs
where we can charge premium prices based on product quality, brand awareness and brand loyalty and
where there is a general lack of competition. One example is APO-Go, which is a category leader in the
treatment of Parkinson’s disease in the United Kingdom.

_Top Five Branded Products_

Our broad and well-diversified portfolio of Branded Products includes numerous mature category leaders
in local markets, many of which have not yet been internationalized. We believe this provides us with
further potential to grow our sales organically.

160


-----

More than two-thirds of the sales generated by our top-30 Branded Products in 2016 were due to products
ranking as one of the top three in their respective countries.

Set forth below are our top five Branded Products by sales in the year ended December 31, 2016, including
their respective market share and market position according to Quintiles IMS:

**2016 Sales**
**Product Name** **Therapeutic area** **(E million)** **2016 Country | Market Position | Market Share**

APO-Go . . . . . . . . . . . . . Parkinson’s disease 66.6 United Kingdom | #1| 99%
Grippostad . . . . . . . . . . . Cough and cold 43.7 Germany | #1 | 30%
Snup . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Rhinitis 24.2 Russia | #1 | 11%
Fultium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Vitamin D deficiency 22.6 United Kingdom | #1 | 38%
Vitaprost . . . . . . . . . . . . . Prostate diseases 20.0 Russia | #2 | 21%

_Portfolio Strategy_

In contrast to our Generics segment, we generally pursue a selective portfolio approach in the Branded
Products segment. As a result, we analyze each geographic market and only include those products in our
portfolio, which we believe are in low supply despite strong demand. Using our judgment, we focus only on
the most recognizable brands, which are well-known to our end-customers and ideally the local market
leader, and have growth opportunities largely independent of local market trends solely on the basis of
promotional and sales support.

_Competitive Drivers_

We believe the key drivers behind competition in the Branded Products space include brand recognition,
customer loyalty, established distribution channels and recommendations from pharmacists. We believe
that we are well-positioned to compete in this market in light of our attractive portfolio of Branded
Products which includes category leaders in mature markets.

_Key Geographic Markets_

Our largest markets in terms of sales of Branded Products include Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom,
Italy and Vietnam. The table below shows our five largest markets by Branded Products sales in the year
ended December 31, 2016:

**2016 Sales**
**(E million)**
Germany . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 177.4

_Trends in Sales Mix_

In recent years, the sales contribution from our Branded Products has increased. This shift in our sales mix
resulted mainly from organic growth, as well as our targeted efforts to increase sales in our Branded
Products segment through acquisitions. Our acquisition of Thornton & Ross in the United Kingdom, for
example, provided us with a leading platform to market our Branded Products in this market. We intend to
continue to focus our growth efforts on Branded Products, as they face significantly fewer regulatory
requirements than Generics. To a lesser extent, the shift was driven by the reclassification of certain
Generics into Branded Products.

We believe the combination of Generics and Branded Products provides significant benefits in terms of
synergies. Our presence in both segments allows us to deepen our local market expertise and regulatory
know-how, exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing and intensify our
long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.

-----

**Our Customers**

We sell our products to a diverse customer base including consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals,
mail-order companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as
well as public or private health insurance organizations. The importance of these customer groups varies by
country. Germany has a well-established tender scheme in place, such that the key purchase decision is
made by the public health insurance system. In our Belgian business, which mostly focuses on Generics, the
most important customer group is the doctors writing prescriptions. In Italy and Spain, pharmacies have
significant discretion to decide which medication is dispensed, such that they are considered the key
decision maker. In Russia, where our product portfolio is heavily weighted toward Branded Products, our
key customers are consumers in the self-payment market. Germany’s public tendering system covers the
majority of generics sales, in which we have operated successfully. In Italy, the United Kingdom and
Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions such as hospitals. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 10% or more of our sales.

**Our Suppliers**

We believe that we do not materially depend on any single supplier. In the year ended December 31, 2016,
no single supplier accounted for 10% or more of our sales. We seek to source our active pharmaceutical
ingredients locally in each of our markets. Most of our supply contracts include mechanisms aimed at
reducing our financial exposure, such as price escalation clauses (which link procurement prices to current
selling prices) and specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes.

**Procurement, Production and Quality Management**

We maintain three supply chain hubs at our locations in Bad Vilbel (Germany), Vrsac (Serbia) and
Moscow (Russia), which carry out the centralized procurement planning for our most important products.
In each hub, we have a specialized supply chain management team, as well as the appropriate
infrastructure.

We generally have significant flexibility in our supply chain management and plan our pharmaceuticals
production with a view to continuous cost improvement. As a result of our large product portfolio, which
includes more than 800 active pharmaceutical ingredients and approximately 18,000 SKUs to
accommodate various dosage forms and package sizes, we rely on a large, international network of internal
and external resources for our supply chain and pharmaceuticals production.

As a result, we have been able to outsource the production of raw and auxiliary materials involved in the
production of our pharmaceuticals to offshore suppliers based in Asia and other markets, which we believe
deliver good quality at competitive prices. In order to efficiently manage our procurement of raw materials
from these suppliers, we maintain specialized procurement offices in Shanghai (China) and Mumbai
(India).

As a manufacturer, we are subject to fluctuations in the market prices of our raw and auxiliary materials.
Additionally, our costs depend significantly on the prices we are able to negotiate with our contract
manufacturers. Under our manufacturing contracts, suppliers typically bear a portion of the loss if our
gross margin decreases as a result of lower sales prices. The pass-through mechanism that we typically rely
on is a price escalation clause which links the procurement prices we pay to our selling prices. In other
cases, we rely on renegotiations or agree specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes, such as
volumes that are put out to tender by public health insurance organizations in the context of discount
agreements (Rabattvertr¨age). Discount agreements are entered into between pharmaceutical companies,
such as us, and insurance carriers, such as national social insurance schemes. In a discount agreement the
pharmaceutical company undertakes to supply certain pharmaceuticals to the insurance carrier or its
customers at a significant discount in exchange for exclusivity in the relevant product category. Discount
agreements typically have a term of one or two years.

In recent years, we have gradually increased the share of in-house production, thereby shifting production
volumes from our contract manufacturers to our own production facilities. Our own production facilities
currently account for approximately 70% of our sales, with the balance being outsourced. Furthermore, in
2016, we manufactured approximately 75% of our in-house production volume in lower-cost countries in
Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and highly flexible
production base. The expansion of cost-effective in-house production coupled with the flexible

162


-----

make-or-buy approach described below, has helped us realize both structural cost advantages and higher
capacity utilization which resulted in lower unit prices.

We take a flexible approach to our make-or-buy decisions. This means that we regularly compare our
in-house production costs to offers we receive from third-party manufacturers and are prepared to
outsource production where this would result in sustainable cost savings. In the past, our decision to
gradually insource production capacity has helped us realize higher capacity utilization. Additionally, the
fact that a large proportion of our manufacturing facilities are located in lower-cost countries has provided
us with structural cost advantages compared to some of our competitors. Together, these factors have
contributed significantly to the decrease in unit costs that we have realized in recent years.

Each year we reinvest in our production facilities and testing laboratories in an effort to ensure they
comply with the applicable regulations and technical norms. In 2016, our investments in the expansion and
renewal of our production facilities and plants, as well as test laboratories, were A22.6 million.

**_Highest Quality and Safety Standards_**

Our global control management is carried out centrally through our group holding company, STADA
Arzneimittel AG.

As an international healthcare company, we have established high standards for the quality of our raw
materials, products, services and working conditions. Some of the quality standards we adhere to, both in
our own manufacturing, sites and those of external suppliers and contract manufacturers, significantly
exceed the standards required by the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our compliance with
both the statutory requirements and our internal standards is reviewed comprehensively each year as part
of regular audits by our global quality management teams.

In addition, the competent national authorities in each country where we operate carry out inspections on
a recurring basis. Within the EU, such inspections typically take place every two or three years. Outside the
EU, we often go beyond the national requirements and inspections and additionally apply for EU Good
Manufacturing Practice-compliance inspections (also known as EU GMP compliance inspections). In the
course of these inspections, the competent authorities audit the compliance of our relevant non-EU
production facilities with the relevant EU GMPs. Each positive inspection report results in a three year
extension of our existing EU import licenses for products manufactured in these facilities. As a result, our
non-EU production facilities in in Banja Luka, Nizhny Novgorod, Obninsk, Podgorica, Sabac, Tuy Hoa and
Vrsac are approved for the production and export of certain pharmaceutical dosage forms into EU
countries.

In addition to our compliance with the applicable legal requirements, we hold international certifications
in accordance with external quality management systems. Accordingly, at numerous production sites, we
not only focus on GMP standards but also on the relevant ISO standards.

Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and even some of our
non-European manufacturing facilities adhere to EU manufacturing standards. As a result, we have a
strong performance and compliance track record. Moreover, local production provides a natural hedge for
currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products
in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our
margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to improve certain aspects of our
manufacturing operations to achieve our ongoing cost savings initiatives.

**Sales and Marketing**

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated
in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a
new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement
regimes and distribution channels. This provides a competitive advantage to existing scale players with
local expertise, such as us.

Building on our extensive local market expertise, we have decided to put in place decentralized marketing
teams, and the size and organization of our sales force is tailored to the local environment in each market.
In Germany, for example, we do not have a dedicated sales force, as the majority of our business is won
through tenders. As a result, our German marketing team is distinguished mostly by its sophisticated
tender management. In Belgium, our sales force targets primarily doctors who are the key decision makers
in the market, whereas our sales teams in Italy and Spain place the emphasis on pharmacies. In Russia, we
market directly to consumers in the self-payment market. As part of our centralized supervision, our
marketing teams research each market extensively and carefully select the products we decide to offer as
part of our country portfolio, as well as their positioning. Our marketing campaigns in the United
Kingdom, for instance, emphasize the filters contained in our Ladival sunscreen products, whereas
marketing of Ladival in Spain focuses on the cosmetic benefits of its ingredients. We believe the
combination of centralized supervision and physical proximity to our customers provides us with a
powerful sales and marketing structure.

We have a direct sales presence in more than 30 countries where we sell our products through our own
marketing teams, subsidiaries and branches, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors.

164


-----

This includes all major European markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain.
In addition, we maintain a direct sales representation in growth-markets in the MENA region (in the
United Arab Emirates), Asia (including Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines), South
America (Argentina) and Australia. Our decision to establish a direct sales presence is also driven by our
local market expertise and is a function of the product portfolio we are offering in a given market. In
geographies where we do not have a direct presence, we partner with recognized local partners. When
including exports, our products were marketed and sold in approximately 125 countries in 2016.

Selective acquisitions are part of our strategy and are also used to expand our existing sales network
through vertical integration. In 2017, for example, we acquired the Serbian pharmaceutical wholesaler
Velexfarm d.o.o. Beograd to strengthen our business activities in the Serbian market. In addition to growth
opportunities, we seek to identify products and markets which are subject to particularly cumbersome
regulatory requirements and to restructure our product portfolio to further reduce our dependency on
state-regulated and therefore price-regulated healthcare systems.

**Our Brands**

We have a large portfolio of recognizable and well-regarded brands. Set forth in the chart below are our
largest brands by sales, together with their market position in each relevant market.

12SEP201718440538

(1) We are the market leader in Poland considering Tramal (#3 on a standalone basis) and Zaldiar (#6 on a standalone basis)
combined.

While we hold ownership rights to most of our brands, some of them are used under license. Most
importantly, we lease our Ladival brand under a sale and leaseback agreement. We also in-license certain
of our Generics, none of which individually represents a material portion of our business. See
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off-Balance Sheet
_Arrangements.’’_

**Material Contracts**

Other than disclosed elsewhere in this offering memorandum, we have not entered into any contracts
outside the ordinary course of our business that we consider material.

**Research and Product Development**

**_Research_**

In order to limit our research and development costs and avoid the risks inherent in the marketing of newly
developed products, our strategy is to focus on the development and marketing of generics. Thus, our
business does not require any material proprietary research and accordingly we do not typically incur
material research expenses.

**_Product Development_**

As the marketing of our products normally requires the prior grant of a marketing authorization issued by
the competent regulators, we incur development costs in connection with the approval process. Given our
global product marketing, we are required to navigate a large number of different approval processes. We
generally seek to realize synergies and obtain marketing authorizations through supranational processes,
which require only a single dossier and cover a large number of countries, particularly in the European
Union. Approval procedures outside of the EU are carried out, where possible, on the basis of the EU
dossier relating to the same product.

To ensure optimal utilization of our resources and effective management of our international approval
processes, we have installed a centralized development center in Bad Vilbel (Germany), and Vrsac
(Serbia). In select cases, we also rely on a global network of external development partners, through which
dossiers or approvals are acquired.

**_Product Launches_**

Building off our tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products per
year since 2014. The large majority of our new products are Generics, whereas new product launches in the
Branded Products segment only make up a small share. We believe the number of our product launches is
high compared to most of our competitors, which is evidence of our strong capabilities in the development
process and our local market expertise. Despite our large portfolio of approximately 18,000 SKUs, 4% of
our sales in 2016 resulted from products that were first introduced within the two preceding years. Our
strong performance was also supported by continued investment in development costs. The chart below
shows our product launches in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, as well as our
research and development costs in the corresponding years:

(1) As of 31 December of respective fiscal years.

(2) Represents research and development costs as per STADA’s income statement. A generics company, STADA typically incurs no
material research expenses. Costs related to the development of new products are usually capitalized, whereas costs for
technical and regulatory maintenance or optimization of existing products are usually expensed in the periods in which they are
incurred and reported under development costs.

Due to the lengthy regulatory approval process typical of the pharmaceutical industry, we consider our
development pipeline an important indicator of our future sales. As of December 31, 2016, we had more
than 1,400 pending applications for approval in relation to more than 160 active pharmaceutical
ingredients and active ingredient combinations covering more than 55 countries. In particular, we have a
large product pipeline in small molecule Generics as we aim to be a one-stop-shop and provide the full
range of drugs that go off patent. Most of our pending applications relate to approvals for Generics within
the EU.

**Intellectual Property**

**_Trademarks_**

In each market where material sales of any of our major Branded Products are made, we register a
trademark. In addition, we continuously register trademarks in respect of new products and renew the
trademarks that are about to expire. Our principal trademarks include APO-Go, Aqualor, Grippostad,
Snup, Vitaprost, Fultium, Ladival (which we lease under a sale and leaseback agreement), Care, Covonia
and Levomecol.

**_Patents_**

As a company focused on generics, we are not materially dependent on patents.

**Employees**

**_Long-Term Personnel Policy_**

Through their extensive expertise and strong commitment, our employees make a substantial contribution
to our continuing success. As a result, our personnel policy focuses on long-term retention and is designed
to support the sustainable development of all of our employees. In terms of training, we offer language
skills support, specialist workshops, seminars and extra-occupational study programs. In addition, we offer
development and support programs, tailored to various career stages, and individual career planning.
Examples of this include exchange programs between German and foreign subsidiaries, as well as
management programs. All personal development measures aim to continuously provide the skills needed
both now and in the future, and to fill management and expert positions from within our own ranks as
much as possible.

**_Development of the Number of Employees_**

In 2016, we had an average of 10,839 employees, compared to 10,441 in 2015 and 10,209 in 2014. As of
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the number of our employees was 10,923, 10,532 and 10,363,
respectively. The increase in recent years was primarily due to our acquisition of the British company
BSMW Limited, the Argentinean Company Laboratorio Vannier S.A., the British company Natures Aid
Limited and a local product portfolio of the Serbian IVANCIC I SINOVI DOO. In connection with these
acquisitions, we assumed labor contracts with a total of 218 additional employees.

In 2016, we had an average of 1,164 employees in Germany, compared to 1,207 and 1,318 in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The average number of employees located at our group headquarters in Bad Vilbel,
Germany, was 908 in 2016, compared to 938 in 2015 and 978 in 2014, respectively. The average number of
employees outside Germany was 9,675 in 2016, compared to 9,234 in 2015 and 8,891 in 2014, respectively.

As of December 31, 2016, women held approximately 49% of all management positions within the Target
Group. We believe that we have healthy relationships with our workforce, and during the periods under
discussion there have not been any material labor disruptions.

**_Pensions_**

We operate a number of pension schemes, including defined benefit schemes in certain countries in which
we operate, such as Germany and the United Kingdom.

**Insurance**

As part of our insurance program, we maintain general and product liability insurance, environmental
liability insurance, all risk property and business interruption insurance, cargo and transport insurance,
industrial legal aid insurance, fidelity insurance, electronic insurance, credit insurance, as well as health
and accident insurance covering most subsidiaries and operations to the extent the Target Group considers
appropriate or otherwise required by applicable law. We are not currently involved in any material claims
under our insurance.

**Information Technology**

Our critical information technology systems are largely operated and hosted by Fujitsu TDS. Our core
systems are centralized in data centers located in Germany where all SAP servers and SAP related
infrastructure for IT systems located in Western Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) are hosted. Other non-core IT systems are operated locally by our local subsidiaries.

**Environmental**

We are subject to a number of local, national and regional laws and other requirements relating to the
protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements
relate to a broad range of our activities, including (i) product and industrial related environmental
protection and (ii) operational management of occupational safety and wellbeing related to hazardous
substances in production activities.

Our capital and operating budgets include the expected costs and expenses necessary to ensure compliance
with these laws. Specifically, we incur labor costs for environmental, health and safety activities, local costs
for industrial environmental protection, investments to improve workplace ergonomics and coverage of

167


-----

substance substitutions. If we do not comply with environmental requirements that apply to our operations,
regulatory agencies could seek to impose civil, administrative and/or criminal liabilities, as well as seek to
curtail our operations. Under certain circumstances, private parties could also seek to impose civil fines or
penalties for violations of environmental laws or recover monetary damages, including those relating to
property damage or personal injury.

The presence of hazardous materials at our facilities may expose us to potential liabilities associated with
the clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater, and we could be liable for (i) the costs of responding
to and remediating that release and (ii) the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release,
among other things. We have not incurred in the past three fiscal years, nor do we anticipate incurring,
material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations. We are not aware of any
environmental liabilities that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are committed to optimizing procedures and processes to conserve resources and minimize our impact
on the environment. Furthermore, as a result of our business model, which excludes the in-house
production of active ingredients, we do not present any significant emission risks. We are currently working
on an integrated corporate governance report which is expected to include key corporate governance
metrics and will be applicable across our entire Target Group.

**Joint Ventures**

We have entered into several joint ventures to access additional geographic markets, further enhance our
local market expertise, minimize costs and increase growth in areas we believe have significant business
potential. For an overview of our joint ventures, see the notes to our Financial Statements included
elsewhere herein. When entering into joint ventures, we generally seek control over the joint undertaking.

Our most significant joint venture is our Vietnamese Joint Venture. It was established between one of our
subsidiaries, STADA Pharmaceutical (Asia) Ltd., and M.S.T. Commercial and Pharmaceutical Company
Limited in Vietnam. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd.’’ and ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may be exposed to the risk of deconsolidation if we_
_do not comply with the requirements set forth in IFRS 10, particularly with respect to our Vietnamese Joint_
_Venture.’’_

**Regulatory and Compliance**

We do business in certain countries that are subject to economic sanctions or known to have weak
measures against money laundering and terrorist financing, including Russia, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen,
Sudan and Libya. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our sales in these countries, excluding Russia,
accounted for less than A10.0 million. Our sales in Russia for the year ended December 31, 2016, were
A92.5 million. We have specific procedures in place to ensure that our exports into these countries comply
with the relevant international, regional and national regulations. For example, prior to entering into a
contract with a customer, we conduct due diligence on our customers and obtain documentation from
them that verifies their identity as well as the identity of their end customers and beneficial owners. In
addition, we tailor our contracts to the specific contractual partners and export countries, providing for
specific payment terms and requiring specific guarantees.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time we become involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers, authorities or business partners and
intellectual property disputes. In particular, our partner in our Vietnamese Joint Venture recently brought
an arbitration claim against us before a tribunal in Singapore, alleging that we violated a non-compete
clause in the underlying joint venture agreement. We are currently evaluating the merit of this claim and
offer no assurances in respect of the outcome of the dispute. Otherwise, we are currently not involved in
any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of
legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

**REGULATION**

**European Union**

**_Overview (Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom)_**

The Target Group’s pharmaceutical business activity comprises the following regulated activity:
(i) medicinal product development (the Target Group only conducts limited proprietary research for new
active pharmaceutical ingredients); (ii) medicinal product authorization; (iii) manufacturing and
procurement of contract manufacturing; (iv) wholesale distribution and supply; (v) pharmacovigilance; and
(vi) promotion. The current range of medicinal products comprises generic, biosimilar, prescription-only
and OTC medicinal products. Each of these activities is subject to strict legislative frameworks at both EU
and national level, compliance with which requires the expenditure of substantial personnel and financial
resources, and breach of which can result in enforcement activity under civil, administrative and/or
criminal law.

While the Target Group also commercializes products that are regulated as medical devices, cosmetic
products and food supplements, the below summarizes the material licenses and regulatory aspects of the
pharmaceutical product regulatory regimes which are applicable to the material parts of the Target
Group’s pharmaceutical business in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom the violation of which
could result in: (i) the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations; (ii) the limitation, suspension
or termination of service; and/or (iii) the imposition of civil, administrative and criminal penalties,
including fines.

**_EU Pharmaceutical Regulatory Regime_**

_Non-Clinical and Clinical Investigations_

Both non-clinical and clinical data (i.e., from studies involving human participants) are generally required
to support a marketing authorization for a medicinal product. Appropriate studies are therefore required,
the conduct of which in the European Economic Area (EEA) is carefully regulated under EU
directives 2010/63/EU, 2004/9/EC, 2004/10/EC and directive 2001/20/EC respectively and corresponding
member state national laws. To the extent that non-clinical research is conducted on animals, this is subject
to significant legislative restrictions. In particular, the person conducting such research and the research
project itself must be authorized by a relevant competent authority. The establishment where the animal
research takes place must also be compliant with the legislation—this entails an additional authorization
under national legislation.

As regards the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, many of the legal obligations in directive 2001/20/EC
and its associated good clinical practice directive 2005/28/EC fall on the ‘‘sponsor’’ of the clinical trial,
which is defined as the individual, company, institution or organization which takes responsibility of the
initiation, management and/or financing of a clinical trial. Before commencement of a clinical trial, the
sponsor must obtain authorization from the competent authority/ies in the member state(s) in which the
trial will be conducted. Approval from a competent national ethics committee in each of the relevant
member states is also a pre-requisite to commencing a trial. The EU clinical trial legislation also imposes
requirements regarding the conduct of the trial itself (which must be conducted in accordance with good
clinical practice (GCP) to generate data acceptable for marketing authorization submission) and safety
reporting of adverse events and reactions amongst other matters. If clinical trials are conducted outside of
the EEA, they must likewise follow the principles set out in the EU legislation if their results are to be
submitted in an application for marketing authorization in the EU in order for the data they generate to be
accepted. These requirements also apply to bioavailability studies conducted to demonstrate acceptable
bioequivalence of generic medicinal products to innovator products.

The regulation of clinical trials conducted in the EEA will undergo significant change when the EU
Clinical Trials Regulation comes into effect which the EMA expects to occur during 2019.

_Marketing Authorizations_

The EU regulatory framework applicable to medicinal products is largely set out in the Community Code
contained in directive 2001/83/EC as transposed into the respective national laws of the EEA member
states. Subject to certain narrow exemptions, this requires that all medicinal products, including also
generic versions of authorized (including previously authorized) products, must obtain a marketing

169


-----

authorization before they can be lawfully placed on the market in the EEA. There are three main
procedures for application for marketing authorization: the Centralized Procedure (operated by the EMA
and the European Commission under EC Regulation 726/2004), the Mutual Recognition Procedure, and
the Decentralized Procedure, both operated by the EEA member state national authorities under the rules
set out in directive 2001/83/EC. It is also possible to obtain a purely national, standalone authorization for
products intended for marketing in a single EEA member state only.

Under the Centralized Procedure, applications must be made to the EMA for an authorization granted in
the form of a single binding European Commission decision to grant a Community marketing
authorization which is simultaneously valid in each of the EEA member states. The Centralized Procedure
is mandatory for biotechnology products. It is also mandatory for advanced therapy medicinal products for
new active substances to treat cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases
or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases and for products designated as orphan medicinal
products. It is optionally available for other new chemical entities or innovative medicinal products, or in
the interest of public health, which may also include applications for Community marketing authorizations
for non-prescription and generic medicinal products of nationally authorized reference products. For
generic marketing authorization applications of Community-authorized reference medicinal products (that
have been authorized under the Centralized Procedure) there is automatic access to the Centralized
Procedure.

The Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure each aim at facilitating access to the
EEA single market by relying upon the principle of mutual recognition. Thus, a marketing authorization or
the assessment in one EEA member state (the reference EEA member state) ought in principle to be
recognized by the competent authorities of the other EEA member states (the concerned EEA member
states (CMSs)), unless there are grounds for supposing that the authorization of the medicinal product
concerned may present a potential serious risk to public health. Under both procedures, if the application
is successful, the CMSs grant a national marketing authorization for the medicinal product.

Under all marketing authorization procedures the applicant must submit a dossier containing, amongst
other items, data demonstrating the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product. For generic
medicinal products there are reduced data submission requirements (no preclinical or clinical study results
are required though bioequivalence must be substantiated, usually via appropriate bioavailability studies).
For similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) some preclinical and/or clinical studies performed
for the original reference product may not need to be reproduced as a biosimilar application is based on a
comparison of the biosimilar and its reference medicine to show there are no significant differences
between them.

At the time of the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product, the competent authority
must specify the classification of the product as either prescription-only or not. National laws may make
provision for certain sub-categories. It is open to the marketing authorization holder to subsequently apply
for an amendment of this classification (either way) subject to filing relevant supporting additional data.

_Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing_

The EU Community Code in directive 2001/83/EC applies substantial requirements to the manufacturing
of medicinal products, which are required to be manufactured in accordance with the principles of good
manufacturing practice (GMP) set out in Commission directive 2003/94/EC. Manufacturing activity
includes the import, total or partial manufacture, including the various processes of dividing up, packaging
and presenting, of medicinal products. There are also prescriptive requirements relating to the content and
design of the packaging and labelling of medicinal products. These include certain mandatory information
which must be stated on the product label, packaging and patient information leaflet.

The manufacturer must ensure that all manufacturing operations for medicinal products subject to a
marketing authorization are carried out in accordance with the information provided in the application for
marketing authorization as accepted by the competent authorities. Any manufacturing operation or linked
operation, which is carried out under contract for the manufacturer, must be the subject of a written
contract between the manufacturer and the subcontractor which defines and allocates responsibilities of
each party and which defines, in particular, the observance of GMP to be followed by each party. The
manufacturer must monitor and review the subcontractor’s performance.

If manufacturing activity is undertaken within the EEA a manufacturing authorization from the relevant
member state is required which is valid for the category of products concerned and which covers the type

170


-----

of manufacturing activity undertaken (e.g. import or packaging etc.). The holder of a manufacturing
authorization is obliged to comply with the principles and guidelines of GMP for medicinal products and to
use as starting materials only active substances (active pharmaceutical ingredients), which have been
manufactured in accordance with GMP for active substances. Excipients for use in medicinal products
must also be produced in accordance with appropriate GMP to be determined following a formal risk
assessment. As a matter of GMP compliance the manufacturer must verify via site audits that suppliers and
distributors of active substances are each complying with GMP and good distribution practice (GDP)
principles. Manufacturers are subject to regular inspections by competent authorities to assess their
compliance with GMP. The manufacturer must also appoint a named ‘‘qualified person’’ who is responsible
for certifying that individual batches of medicinal product satisfy the legal requirements.

Manufacturing authorizations must be issued by the member state authority where the manufacturing
activity and plant is located and are holder and site-specific. EU member state competent authorities also
undertake GMP inspections of manufacturers located in countries outside of the EEA which are engaged
in the manufacture of medicinal products to be supplied in the EU. A EU-based manufacturer may only
import active substances from outside the EEA if the active substances have been manufactured in
accordance with GMP equivalent to EU GMP for active substances and if they are accompanied by a
written confirmation from the competent authority of the exporting third country, which as regards the
plant manufacturing the exported active substance, confirms that the standards of GMP and control of the
plant are equivalent to those in the EEA. Alternatively, active substances may be imported from countries
on the white list of recognized GMP-equivalent countries operated by the Commission.

From 2019 the EU falsified medicines legislation (now incorporated in directive 2001/83/EC and in
delegated acts) will impose additional obligations on manufacturers regarding certain safety and
anti-tamper features to be included on product packaging (where required).

_Distribution_

Entities undertaking the wholesale distribution of medicinal products are also required to hold a wholesale
dealer’s authorization from the EEA Member State where the distribution activity is taking place and must
fulfil specified requirements concerning suitability and adequacy of premises, installations and equipment,
so as to ensure proper conservation and distribution of the medicinal products. These requirements also
extend to staff. In particular a distributor must have a qualified ‘responsible person’ who meets national
legislative requirements regarding qualifications.

Wholesale distribution covers all activities consisting of procuring, holding, supplying or exporting
medicinal products, apart from supplying medicinal products to the public. Such activities are carried out
with manufacturers or their depositories, importers, other wholesale distributors or with pharmacists and
persons authorized or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public in the Member State concerned.

Distributors are subject to regular site and system inspections by competent authorities to assess the
distributor’s compliance with applicable legal requirements in the Community Code in
directive 2001/83/EC, which include compliance with the principles of EU GDP. Distributors must keep
certain records and documentation (particularly for the purposes of facilitating product and batch recall)
and must operate a quality system and have a plan for effective implementation of recalls. Distributors are
also obligated to confirm that entities from whom they obtain supplies of medicinal product have the
appropriate authorizations and, where applicable, have complied with GDP principles. They may also only
supply to entities who possess appropriate authorizations.

From 2019 the EU falsified medicines legislation will also impose additional obligations on distributors
regarding the verification of specified safety and anti-tamper features to be included on product packaging
(where required).

_Pharmacovigilance_

‘‘Pharmacovigilance’’ refers to the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem. Marketing
authorization holders are subject to detailed and extensive risk management and pharmacovigilance
obligations under Directive 2001/83/EC and EC Regulation 726/2004 and the associated guideline on good
pharmacovigilance practices. Amongst other matters these include the implementation of risk
minimization measures on a per product basis as well as a requirement for the marketing authorization
holder to operate a pharmacovigilance system to monitor the safety of authorized medicinal products and

171


-----

to detect any change to their risk-benefit balance. Details of the pharmacovigilance system must be set out
in the pharmacovigilance system master file, which must be maintained by the marketing authorization
holder and kept available for inspection by competent authorities upon request. The marketing
authorization holder must establish and use a ‘‘quality system’’ to perform its pharmacovigilance
obligations.

Pharmacovigilance obligations on the marketing authorization holder include detailed obligations
regarding reporting. For example, a marketing authorization holder must record all suspected adverse
reactions in the EEA or in countries outside of the EEA which are brought to its attention, and report such
information via the centralized Eudravigilance database. The marketing authorization holder must also
submit periodic safety updates to the EMA regarding the benefits and risks of the medicinal product.
Other pharmacovigilance obligations are imposed regarding the availability to the marketing authorization
holder of appropriate personnel and resources. For example, the marketing authorization holder must
have permanently and continuously at its disposal an appropriately ‘qualified person responsible for
pharmacovigilance’ who resides in the EEA.

_Promotion_

Directive 2001/83/EC sets out strict rules on the advertising of medicinal products. The concept of
advertising is broadly defined and includes any form of door-to-door information, canvassing activity or
inducement designed to promote the prescription, supply, sale or consumption of medicinal product.
Advertising must not be misleading and there is a positive obligation for the advertising to encourage the
rational use of a medicinal product amongst other matters. All promotional materials and activity must
also comply with the official Summary of Product Characteristics which is always issued for an authorized
medicinal product by the authorizing competent authority.

The advertising of medicines in the EU is permitted subject to certain restrictions in directive 2001/83/EC.
For example, the advertising of unauthorized medicines is prohibited. This includes the advertising of a
medicine before a marketing authorization has been granted, as well as the advertising of an authorized
medicine for uses (i.e. therapeutic indications) outside the scope of its marketing authorization (so called
‘‘off label’’). Advertising of prescription-only medicines to the general public is also prohibited, as is the
provision of samples to the public for promotional purposes. In addition, the EU legislation gives members
states certain flexibility to ensure adequate and effective monitoring of advertising and the detailed rules
regarding promotion and monitoring are consequently not fully harmonized across the EEA.

_Sanctions for Infringement Under EU Law_

Under Commission Regulation 658/2007, the Commission may directly impose financial penalties where
the holder of a Community marketing authorization has intentionally or negligently breached certain
obligations set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. The power to impose financial penalties applies in
cases where the infringement may have significant public health implications in the EEA; where it has a
EEA dimension by taking place or having its effects in more than one Member State; or where interests of
the EEA are involved.

In the event of an infringement, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 5% of the marketing
authorization holder’s turnover in the EEA in the preceding year. If the infringement is ongoing, the
Commission may impose periodic penalty payments per day of up to 2.5% of the marketing authorization
holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until such time as the infringement is
terminated. The Commission may also impose a fine of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s
EEA turnover in the preceding business year if the marketing authorization holder fails to cooperate with
the Commission’s investigation of the potential breach. Where the non-cooperation continues, the
Commission may impose periodic penalty payments per day of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization
holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until the non-cooperation is
terminated.

_Enforcement Under National Law_

Enforcement of the regulatory requirements outlined above takes place at a national level and is
underpinned by national member state law.

_Enforcement Under UK Law_

The EU pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is generally enforced in the UK under the criminal law via
offences set out in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and the Medicines Act 1968. A person guilty of
an offence is generally liable to up to two years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Liability can arise
for a corporate offender and also for individual officers of the company (or any person purporting to act in
such capacity). Members of the company may also be liable if the affairs of the company are managed by
its members.

The UK competent authority has a range of enforcement powers. As well as prosecuting the company
and/or individual responsible, the competent authority has investigatory powers enabling it to enter,
inspect, and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authority can also suspend or
revoke any UK marketing authorization, manufacturing authorization, or wholesale dealer authorization,
thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities.

_Enforcement Under German Law_

The EU pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is transposed and indirectly enforced in Germany mainly via
the Medicinal Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz), and various ordinances passed thereunder. General laws
applicable also to pharmaceutical companies in their business behavior are the Administrative Offences
Act (Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz), the Health Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz)—as far as promotional
measures are concerned—and the Criminal Code with its anti-fraud and anti-kickback provisions. A
person guilty of an offence can be liable to a fine or imprisonment under administrative or criminal law,
depending on the nature of the violation. For example, any person who negligently commits the act or who
willfully or negligently fails to operate a pharmacovigilance system or fails to fulfil certain general
pharmacovigilance obligations shall be deemed to have committed an administrative offence. Committing
an administrative offence may result in a fine not exceeding A25,000. A violation of the Health Advertising
Act can lead to an administrative offence; however, in practice, these aspects are mainly dealt with in civil
law proceedings like requests for preliminary injunctions initiated by a competitor or patient organization.

The German competent authorities, which are both authorities at a national level—in particular the
Federal Institute for Drugs and medical Devices (BfArM)—and at a regional level—the administrative
authorities in the respective federal states—have a range of enforcement powers. As well as the power to
prosecute the company and/or individual responsible, the competent authorities have investigatory powers
enabling them to enter, inspect, and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent
authorities can also suspend or revoke any German marketing authorization, manufacturing authorization,
wholesale dealer authorization, thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities.
As regards enforcement of the restrictions on promotional activities, in practice this is typically done
through civil law proceedings brought by competitors and/or associations for fair competition.

_Enforcement Under Italian Law_

The EU pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is enforced in Italy under criminal and administrative
sanctions set out in the Legislative Decrees 211/2003 and 219/2006. A person guilty of an offence is
generally liable to up to three years’ imprisonment and/or unlimited fine. Pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/2001, a company is liable for crimes committed, for the benefit or the advantage of the
company, by its representatives (i.e., directors, managers and other employees). Companies may avoid this
liability by approving and actually implementing a compliance program for the organization of a system of
procedures and supervisory activities aimed at preventing the commission of such offences.

The Italian competent authorities are entrusted with a wide range of enforcement powers relevant to their
own areas of competence, including (i) undertaking inspections and audits, (ii) suspending and revoking
authorizations (i.e., marketing, manufacturing, import, wholesale distribution and advertising
authorizations) and (iii) issuing interdictory measures or pecuniary fines.

_Enforcement Under Spanish Law_

The Spanish pharmaceutical industry enforcement regime comprises, mainly, administrative law rules and
regulates the clinical investigation, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, pharmacovigilance and
promotion of medicinal products. In line with the EU legislation, it is required that medicinal products
must receive a marketing authorization granted by the Spanish Agency of Medicinal Products (‘‘AEMPS’’)
which belongs to the Ministry of Health and Social Services before medicinal products can be placed on

173


-----

the market. Additionally, manufacturers, importers and marketers of medicinal products are required to
hold an authorization granted by the AEMPS. Authorization holders shall comply with security,
effectiveness, identification and information obligations regarding the medicinal products marketed. Once
the regulatory authorizations are granted, the latter are included in the AEMPS registry and
communicated to the EMA for information purposes available to the public.

Spanish State and Regional authorities are empowered to investigate any conduct, to enter into any
establishment or to seize any sample in order to verify the compliance of the legislation. Failure to comply
with the legislation may result in administrative fines to be imposed to the authorization holder up to
A30,000 for minor infringements, up to A90,000 for serious infringements or up to A1,000,000 or five times
the medicinal products involved, for very serious infringements; seizure of the illegal benefit obtained;
closure of the establishment; suspension of the corresponding activities or/and withdrawal of the medicinal
product from the market.

Additionally, if the aforementioned conducts, and other related conducts described in articles 361 and
subsequent of the Spanish Criminal Code, endanger human life and health, those provisions establish as
penalties for the person who commits the criminal offence a prison sentence up to four years, a fine which
will depend on his economic situation and a specific disqualification for the exercise of his profession or for
trading. In some circumstances the company itself can be liable for the conducts perpetuated by their
employees, in which case, article 366 of the Spanish Criminal Code determinates for the company fines up
to five times the medicinal products involved and foresees the possibility to additionally impose other
penalties, such as the winding up of the company, suspension of its activity, closure of its establishments,
prohibition to carry out the activities, prohibition of obtaining public subsidies and judicial intervention.

**_Russia_**

**_Overview_**

The development, pre-clinical/clinical trial development, registration, manufacturing, safety, storage,
transportation, advertising, sale, use and destruction of pharmaceuticals in the Russian Federation is
strictly regulated by national laws and since May 6, 2017 by the regulations of Eurasian Economic Union
(EAEU) on united pharmaceutical market, formed by its members, Armenia, Belorussia, Kazakhstan,
Kirgizia, Russia. The regulations of EAEU as international law prevail over the national legislation. The
EAEU regulations concern the registration of pharmaceuticals, labelling, packaging, good practices and
pharmacovigilance. Licensing, price formation, state procurement and advertising remain the exclusive
competence of each member state.

_Pre-Clinical / Clinical Trial Development_

Prior to applying for registration of a pharmaceutical product, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are
usually arranged by a ‘‘developer.’’ The developer is the organization which owns the results of the studies
and/or the relevant pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies. All studies must confirm the
pharmaceutical quality of the products and demonstrate their safety and efficacy.

Pre-clinical research is conducted on animals. The laboratory where the relevant research takes place is
subject to strict control by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.

The developer is obliged to conduct the relevant studies according to clinical trials permission granted by
the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Such permission is granted after the Ministry conducts a
review of the application and accompanying documents submitted by the developer or any person
authorized by the developer.

Clinical research conducted on humans is subject to significant legislative restrictions. In particular, a
person conducting such research must have relevant experience and the institution where the research
takes place must be authorized by the Ministry of Health. Successful results of clinical trials are a
mandatory condition for registration of a pharmaceutical product.

_Registration Process_

Pharmaceuticals can be manufactured, stored, transported, sold, used or destroyed only upon obtaining the
registration certificate which is issued by the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation.

At the applicant’s option, the registration procedure can be carried out in accordance with Russian or
EAEU regulations. Depending on the option chosen, the issued registration certificate will be valid on the

174


-----

territory of Russian Federation or in all EAEU member states, respectively. After 2021, only EAEU
regulations on registration will remain in force.

According to Russian regulations, the duration of the registration process ranges from 60 (for generic
pharmaceuticals) to 210 (for original pharmaceuticals) calendar days. EAEU regulations envisage 210
calendar days as the maximum duration of the registration process. Clinical trials are not included in that
term. Usually the whole registration process takes at least 1.5-2 years for original and appx. 8-12 months
for generic pharmaceuticals. Usually, the costs for registration of original pharmaceuticals start from
3,000,000 Rubles and from 700,000 Rubles for generics. EAEU registration costs may be lower as results of
clinical trials conducted in other EAEU states as well as in the member states of the International
Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human
Use (ICH) may be accepted as part of the application.

After grant, the registration certificate can be annulled by the Ministry of Health for a number of reasons
such as danger to health, infringement of the rights of a third party, absence of the pharmaceutical from
the Russian market for more than three years, among others.

Violations such as manufacturing or sale of unregistered pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to
5,000,000 Rubles or the suspension of the licensed activity for up to 90 days. Suspension of the activity can
only be ordered by the court. If the violations have not been remedied after the expiry of the suspension
period, the license on manufacturing of pharmaceuticals (see below) can be annulled upon application of
the respective regulatory body by a ruling of the court.

If the value of manufactured or sold unregistered pharmaceuticals exceeds 100,000 Rubles, an individual
(e.g. employee of the company) found responsible may be subject to criminal sanctions of up to eight years’
imprisonment and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 2,000,000 Rubles; or (ii) the income of the offender for
a period of six months to up to two years. The offender may also be prohibited from occupying certain
posts or engaging in certain activities for a period of up to five years,.

In case of death or grievous harm caused by an unregistered pharmaceutical, the term of imprisonment can
be up to twelve years with a fine in the amount of: (i) 5,000,000 Rubles; or (ii) the income of the
responsible person for a period of two to five years. The offender may also be prohibited from occupying
certain posts or engaging in certain activities for a period of up to ten years.

_Manufacturing and Distribution of Pharmaceuticals_

Manufacturing of pharmaceuticals requires a license and a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
certificate, both issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russian Federation. Manufacturing
pharmaceuticals without a license is a criminal offence and may lead to imprisonment for up to eight years
and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 3,000,000 Rubles; or (ii) the income of the offender for a period of
one to three years.

If ethanol is used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical substance, this must be recorded in the Unified
State Automated System (USAS, 12SEP201702304679) in order to control the volumes and circulation of
pharmaceutical products containing alcohol. Failure to comply with the USAS record requirements can
lead to a fine of up to 200,000 Rubles.

A further license is required for laboratory activities which use causative agents of infectious diseases and
genetically modified organisms of III and IV pathogenicity level. This license is issued by the Federal
Service on Surveillance for Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-being. A major change of
control in a license holder entity is subject to prior approval by the special government committee.

Distribution (whether wholesale or retail) of pharmaceuticals requires a license on pharmaceutical activity,
issued by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. The online sale of pharmaceuticals is
prohibited.

The manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals containing narcotics, psychotropic substances or
their precursors is subject to an additional license on the circulation of such substances. The license is
issued by the Federal Service for Supervision in Healthcare of Russian Federation.

Violation of the regulations on manufacture or distribution of pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to
30,000 Rubles, provided such actions do not violate the licensing requirements (mandatory requirements
which the license holder must comply with). As a general rule, violation of any licensing requirements can
lead to a fine of up to 40,000 Rubles. Major violations of the license requirements can lead to a suspension

175


-----

of the licensed activity (for example distribution) for up to 90 days. The activity can be suspended only
upon a ruling of the court. If the major violations have not been remedied after the expiry of the
suspension period, the license can be annulled upon application of the respective regulatory body by a
ruling of the court.

_Pharmacovigilance (Pharmaceuticals Safety Monitoring)_

The company is required to establish a phamacovigilance system, including the appointment of a qualified
person to collect, assess and report safety information with regard to the benefit/risk assessment of the
product and adverse events.

After the product registration certificate has been granted, the registration certificate holder must submit
periodic regular safety reports to the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. In addition, the
registration certificate holder must continuously monitor the benefit/risk balance of the product and
implement and monitor procedures for the performance of adverse event collection, evaluation and
reporting, updating of risk management plans and other pharmacovigilance measures.

The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare will inform the Ministry of Health of negative safety
information it obtains, as a result of which the latter can suspend the circulation of the pharmaceutical or
revoke the registration certificate.

For non-disclosure of adverse events the registration certificate holder can be charged with a fine of up to
5,000 Rubles. If such non-disclosure creates a danger to people, animals or the environment, the
responsible individual may bear criminal liability and be charged with a fine of up to 300,000 Rubles and
imprisonment of up to two years. The offender may also be prohibited from holding certain positions and
engaging in certain activities for a period of up to three years.

_Promotion of Pharmaceuticals_

The promotion of registered pharmaceuticals is permitted, subject to certain restrictions. For example, the
advertising of pharmaceuticals may not: (i) contain specific cases of recovery or expressions of gratitude
from patients; (ii) create an impression of advantages of the product by referring to mandatory clinical
trials; (iii) create an impression of necessity of usage of the advertised product for consumers with a certain
disease; (iv) create an impression of the absence of the necessity to consult a healthcare professional;
(v) guarantee the positive impact, safety and absence of any side effects of the advertised product;
(vi) advertise a pharmaceutical product as a biologically active supplement; or (vii) claim that the safety
and efficiency of the pharmaceutical product are guaranteed by its natural origin.

Prescription pharmaceuticals can be advertised only during special events for healthcare professionals or in
press specially designated for healthcare professionals. In such cases advertising may refer to specific
patient case studies. Prescription pharmaceuticals may not be advertised to consumers.

Advertising compliance is regulated by the Federal Antitrust Service of Russian Federation. Violation of
the pharmaceuticals advertising legislation can lead to a fine up to 500,000 Rubles for each instance of
violation.

_VEP Circulation_

The Russian government approves a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (VEP) annually. This list
includes international non-proprietary names of pharmaceuticals for treating the most common or
top-priority conditions. VEPs’ maximum prices must be approved by and registered with the Ministry of
Health and Federal Antitrust Service. Overpricing can result in a fine of double the amount of excess
earnings (i.e. the amount earned by the overcharge) for the period of the violations, up to a maximum
period of one year.

VEPs produced abroad are subject to restrictions for state procurement purposes: if two or more national
or EAEU analogous products participate in the state procurement procedure the foreign product is
excluded from the tender.

National manufacturers of VEPs can also apply for subsidies from the government.

**Reimbursement of Medicinal Products**

**_The EU Directive on the Transparency of Measures Regulating the Pricing of Medicinal Products (89/105/EEC)_**

Directive 89/105/EEC places obligations on EEA member states in respect of their regulation of the
pricing of medicinal products. These obligations include: prescribed time periods in which a competent
authority must respond to an application for approval of the price / price increase of a medicinal product
(where such approval is required before the product can be marketed or the price increase implemented,
respectively); obligations to regularly review price freezes to consider the justification of such price freezes
and prescribed time periods for announcing the results of such reviews; requirements to give reasons for
certain decisions; obligations to publish prescribed information and provide prescribed information to the
European Commission regarding products for which prices have been fixed and the prices which may be
charged including any price increases; and time periods for communicating decisions (including exclusions)
on whether reimbursement of a medicinal product will be covered by a national health insurance system.
These obligations include communicating criteria used by national social security systems for therapeutic
classification of medicinal products as well as criteria used by competent authorities to verify transfer
pricing used by companies for active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediate manufactured or finished
medicinal products.

Member states are also obliged to publish information and to communicate to the Commission regarding
the methods and criteria they apply to define profitability, return on sales and/or return on capital,
including the ranges of target profit permitted and the maximum percentage of profit permitted to persons
placing medicinal products on the market.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in England & Wales_**

In England and Wales, the measures adopted to regulate the pricing of medicines vary according to the
type of medicine. The generic term ‘‘Government’’ is used in this context to refer to the Department of
Health and other NHS bodies running the public health service in England and Wales.

_Branded Medicines_

The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2014 (‘‘PPRS’’) is a voluntary scheme open to
manufacturers and suppliers which regulates the pricing of branded medicines (including branded
generics) supplied to the NHS in the UK and which is in place until the end of 2018. It therefore does not
cover sales of unbranded generics to the NHS or any sales outside the NHS, e.g. private prescription sales
or non-NHS OTC sales. According to Government figures released at the end of 2016, in 2015 almost 90%
of branded medicines supplied to the NHS in the UK were supplied by PPRS members.

Key features of the PPRS are as follows:

- A profit cap for individual members who elect to be part of the scheme and a general repayment
across all members where NHS spend on branded medicines exceeds predicted growth levels.

- In relation to product pricing, there is freedom of pricing at launch where new active substances are
granted marketing authorization, including line extensions of such new medicines within five years of
the marking authorization. However, this freedom is limited by an expectation that pricing will be
‘‘close’’ to value assessments for new medicines provided by the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence, an executive non-departmental Government body.

- All other pricing, including price increases or variations, are subject to Government consent. There
are flexible pricing options or special rules for defined scenarios (such as new indications), but the
Government generally has discretion as to what may be accepted.

There is as yet no indication of the contents of any renewal of the PPRS post-2018.

Therefore, under the PPRS, although the technical position is freedom of pricing at launch, there are
notable constraints on individual product pricing and the profit/repayment mechanisms influence PPRS
members’ pricing across their portfolios. The PPRS is not a reimbursement scheme as such, but is rather a
system to control the profitability of persons placing branded medicinal products on the market.

The Government does not use external reference pricing for medicines, but UK prices are often used as
reference pricing elsewhere and the above factors will be relevant where that is the case.

177


-----

_The Statutory Scheme_

Suppliers of branded medicines which do not elect to join the PPRS are subject to a statutory scheme for
sales to the NHS which imposes a 15% price cut on the NHS list price of medicines on sale on
December 1, 2013, unless the medicines were procured under a framework agreement under the Public
Contracts Regulations 2006 before that date at a higher price than that achieved by the 15% price cut. On
August 23, 2017, the Department of Health introduced a consultation on draft legislation to introduce a
new statutory scheme which would remove the 15% price cut and introduce a repayment mechanism
modelled on that currently applicable under the PPRS.

_Unbranded Generics_

In principle, there is freedom of pricing for unbranded generic prescription-only pharmaceuticals, which
are subject to competition on the open market. However, the following two factors may influence prices
charged by generic suppliers:

- The price at which pharmacists are reimbursed for dispensing prescription generics is set by the ‘‘Drug
Tariff,’’ Part VIIIA of which lists reimbursement prices for the vast majority of generic prescription
pharmaceuticals. Different methods for calculating reimbursement pricing are applied to different
categories of generics. For instance, most generics fall into Category M, the reimbursement prices for
which are set based on the volume-weighted average charged by suppliers who elect to join ‘‘Scheme
M’’ and who provide relevant pricing information. Scheme M is a voluntary scheme for the gathering
of such information, i.e. the Category M reimbursement prices are based on information from some
only of the suppliers of Category M products. The Government’s August 23, 2017, consultation
documents (see above) suggest that Scheme M may be replaced by mandatory information provision
by all suppliers of unbranded generics.

- Section 262 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (as amended by recent legislation) grants the
Government power to limit any price charged by the supplier of any medicine to the NHS where that
medicine is not covered by a voluntary scheme. This would in theory apply to (i) branded medicines
subject to the statutory scheme, (ii) unbranded generics, (iii) OTC medicines dispensed under a
prescription unless caught by the PPRS (see below) or (iv) a medicine sold OTC to the NHS.
However, any enforcement under s262 requires a proactive step by the Government and consultation
with a relevant industry body (such as a trade association).

_OTC Sales_

The only potential pricing constraint on the sale of products which are actually sold OTC is s262 of the
National Health Service Act 2006 (see above), and then only for OTC sales to the NHS. Otherwise, the
sale of products OTC is free on the open market.

Where OTC medicines are prescribed on the NHS, two features may influence a supplier’s pricing:

- The cost of purchasing and dispensing an OTC medicine prescribed on the NHS is in principle
reimbursable to community pharmacies, unless it features on a ‘‘black list’’ of non-reimbursable
products which forms part of the Drug Tariff.

- Where an OTC medicine’s prescription sales are below £50,000, the Government may exercise a
discretion to exclude such sales from PPRS calculations relevant to the profit cap and the industry
repayment. A PPRS member company should therefore note that any sales of prescribed OTC
products will count towards such calculations, where the Government has not exercised this discretion.

For non-PPRS-members, the Government has confirmed that OTC sales (including where OTC products
are prescribed) are not subject to the statutory scheme.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Germany_**

_Reimbursement Regime_

Being covered by health insurance is compulsory in Germany. There are two different types of insurance:
(i) statutory health insurance, and (ii) private health insurance. For an employee, membership in the
statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless his/her income rises above an annually determined
threshold. One element of the German healthcare system is that medicinal products are reimbursed to the
patient, either by the statutory health insurance, in which case the patient does not need to directly pay for

178


-----

the products (except for a low participation fee), or by the private health insurance, in which case the
patient first pays for the product and then receives reimbursement from the private health insurer.

In Germany, for the reimbursement of medicinal products according to the statutory health insurance a
distinction needs to be made between prescription drugs and non-prescription drugs. Prescription-only
medicinal products are only available on prescription by either a doctor, dentist or veterinarian (§ 48
German Medicinal Products Act). In general, according to the current rules and regulations, the
reimbursement system applies to all prescription drugs with the exception of:

- medicinal products for the treatment of colds and flu-like infections including cold remedy, painkiller,
cough steaming treatment or cough expectorant;

- mouth and throat therapeutics not involving fungal infection;

- laxative;

- medication for travel sickness;

- medication that primarily focuses on improvement of life quality;

  - erectile dysfunction;

  - increase sexual potency;

  - smoking cessation;

  - emaciation;

  - curbing appetite;

  - regulation of weight; and

  - improvement of hair growth.

The reimbursement of non-prescription medicinal products is restricted. In general, nonprescription
products are not part of the reimbursement system if the insured person is older than twelve years old and
does not have any developmental disorder before the end of the 18[th] year of life (§ 34 Abs.1 of Volume V
of the Social Insurance Code). Outside the reimbursement framework there is freedom to price for
manufacturers.

_Price Setting_

For the sale of medicinal products German law provides for a pricing framework to ensure consistent
prices for the same medicinal products. For the ‘‘pharmaceutical entrepreneur’’ (usually the marketing
authorization holder) of medicinal products the principle of free pricing for products generally applies.
However, a restriction for free pricing may result out of the so-called benefit assessment according to the
social security code. In essence, the marketing authorization holder must prove additional benefits over
comparable available products. If the marketing authorization holder fails and there is no therapeutic
improvement on the basis of the benefit assessment then the medicinal product will be added to the
existing reference pricing list. This also has an economic pressure effect on the marketing authorization
holder to reduce the prices to the existing reference pricing list in order to be competitive on the market. If
an innovative (i.e., non-generic) medicinal product demonstrates additional benefits because there is a
therapeutic improvement then the price can be negotiated between the marketing authorization holder
and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds. For products in the generics
market there is a mandatory discount of 10% of the ex-factory price if they are distributed at the expense
of the public health care system (§ 130a of Volume V of the Social Insurance Code). There can also be
other restrictions in Volume V of the Social Insurance Code such as a regulation of reference prices,
compulsory manufacturer discounts.

In addition, pharmaceutical entrepreneur must guarantee a uniform sales price for medicinal products
which are to be dispensed exclusively in pharmacies and are subject to reimbursement by the statutory
health insurance.

In the case of non-prescription medicinal products which are to be reimbursed by the statutory health
insurance, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur shall specify their uniform sales price from which exceptions
may be made in individual cases (§ 78 Medicinal Products Act).

179


-----

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Italy_**

In order to be placed on the market, medicinal products must be priced and assigned (by AIFA, i.e. the
Italian Medicines Agency) to a reimbursable class (i.e., class A, H or C), which is aimed at identifying
whether the cost of a medicinal product is charged to the Italian National Health Service (the ‘‘Italian
NHS’’) (this is the case of class A and H products) or to the public (this is the case of class C products).

Class A includes essential products and those intended for chronic diseases (e.g., antibiotics, antidiabetic,
antitumor medicines), and these are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS. To acquire these products, a valid
prescription must be obtained.

Class H includes products requiring specialist supervision that are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS if
dispensed in hospitals.

Class C includes other products which do not have the characteristics of class A or class H and are not
reimbursed by the Italian NHS. In particular, class C includes prescription-only medicinal products,
non-prescription-only medicinal products which cannot be advertised to the public and
non-prescription-only medicinal products which may be advertised to the public (so-called OTC products).

The mechanism for determining the prices of medicinal products differs depending on whether they are
reimbursable (class A and H) or not (class C).

In particular, AIFA applies price regulation only to reimbursed medicines. For non-reimbursed medicines
(class C), the price is freely set by pharmaceutical companies but is monitored by AIFA and the Ministry of
Health in order to keep the prices at reasonable levels. Although, in principle, the prices of class C
medicinal products are freely set by the pharmaceutical companies, in practice they have been increasingly
regulated by way of legislative provisions according to which pharmaceutical companies may only increase
the prices of class C pharmaceuticals every other January (The prices assigned by manufacturers are
maximum prices at national level. Price reductions by manufacturers are allowed at any time, whilst price
increases are endorsed in January of odd years).

With reference to class C medicinal products, however:

(a) as to medicinal products which are subject to medical prescription, AIFA carries out monitoring
action aimed at verifying compliance with two main conditions: (i) that the price of medicinal products
can be increased every two years (in odd years); and (ii) that the increase may not exceed the target
inflation rate; and

(b) as to medicinal products which are not subject to medical prescription, the price is freely determined
by manufacturers.

With reference to class A and H medicinal products, a specific negotiation procedure between AIFA and
pharmaceutical companies holding marketing authorizations is provided for in the applicable legislation in
order to determine the price of the relevant medicinal products. The negotiation procedure is conducted
according to the following criteria: therapeutic value, pharmacovigilance data, price in other EU countries,
price of similar products within the same pharmaceutical therapeutic group, internal market forecasts,
number of potential patients and therapeutic innovation.

In order to determine the price of medicinal products, the negotiation between AIFA and pharmaceutical
companies requires completion of a four-stage procedure:

(i) Pharmaceutical companies file with AIFA a specific reimbursement and pricing request supported by
a dossier aimed at proving: (i) a positive cost/benefit ratio (which means that the medicinal product
(a) is to be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no effective treatment, or
provide a more appropriate response in respect of products already available for the same therapeutic
indications; or (b) presents a more favorable risk/benefit ratio if compared to other medicinal
products already available); or (ii) other elements of interest for the NHS, if the medicinal product
does not present a significant clinical superiority compared to other products already available or that
it is at least as effective and safer that other products already available.

(ii) AIFA Technical Scientific Committee (‘‘CTS’’) provides its opinion on reimbursement by an
evaluation of the clinical-therapeutic value.

(iii) AIFA Pricing and Reimbursement Committee (‘‘CPR’’) evaluates the dossier, taking also into
consideration the consumer spending data provided by the OSMED—National Observatory on the
Use of Medicines, and hears the company as part of the negotiation.

180


-----

(iv) The negotiation outcome is submitted to the CTS for its final opinion and then to AIFA Management
Board for approval.

The results of the negotiation procedure are published in the Italian Official Gazette.

A price agreement reached between AIFA and the manufacturer of the medicinal product lasts 24 months
and is subject to an automatic renewal for an additional period of 24 months unless previously terminated
by either party. In the event of changes in the therapeutic indications of a medicinal product leading to a
potential increase in its use, the negotiation must be re-opened before the expiry of the agreement. It is
common practice to establish under the negotiation procedure a proportionate relationship between the
price paid and the volume of sales of the medicinal product.

If there is no agreement on the price, then the medicinal product is classified as not-reimbursable and
listed in class C.

As a general principle, the price of medicinal products, which includes VAT (applied in the measure of
10%), includes the ex-factory value (which is the price of industry revenue) and the amounts due to
wholesalers and pharmacists.

The pricing negotiation procedure for generics does not differ from that of other medicines, although,
based on applicable regulations, it should guarantee at least a 20% price reduction below the price of the
originator reference medicinal product.

The Italian NHS only reimburses class A and H medicinal products; no reimbursement is provided for
class C medicinal products.

In Italy, a reference price system (‘‘RPS’’)—which is one of the instruments used to control public
expenditure on pharmaceutical products—has been in effect since 2001.

Under the RPS, the Italian NHS reimburses the lowest price among the prices of off-patent medicinal
products with equal composition in active ingredients, with the same pharmaceutical form, same method of
administration, same number of units and same unit dosage. When patients refuse the substitution of a
medicine eligible for generic substitution and/or if the doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical product with a
price higher than the reference price and specifically provides that the said pharmaceutical product cannot
be substituted with other products, the difference is paid by patients.

In Italy, medicinal products are traditionally distributed by pharmacies. Exceptions include a few widely
used or very expensive products, which are distributed directly by the Local Health Authorities (LHAs)
and by hospitals. Drug reimbursement is made by the LHAs to the pharmacies.

Once a medicinal product is authorized, it is not immediately eligible for reimbursement.

As a very general principle, reimbursement is provided for essential medicinal products, namely products:
(i) for diseases for which no therapeutic alternative exists; or (ii) for which the medicinal products already
available on the market do not provide a satisfactory or appropriate answer; and (iii) which present a
better cost/benefit and risk/benefit analysis than those offered by medicinal products already on the
market. Even in the absence of the above characteristics, medicinal products which are as safe and
effective as those already on the market may be reimbursable depending on the result of their cost/benefit
evaluation.

When evaluating eligibility for reimbursement, AIFA also takes into consideration the following factors in
relation to the medicinal products: the sales price in other EU member states; the therapeutic class; the
foreseen market share in the following 24 months; the impact on expenditures for the Italian NHS; and the
place in the industrial environment.

To apply for reimbursement, the marketing authorization holder must submit an application alongside
documentation proving, inter alia, a positive cost/benefit ratio to demonstrate that the medicinal products
is to be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no medical care, or that it
provides more adequate treatment compared to other medicinal products already placed on the market.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Spain_**

Public reimbursement of medicinal products is tightly regulated by the Spanish legislation under the
equality principle within the whole Health National System (‘‘HNS’’) and only applies for those
prescription medicinal products (prescribed by pharmacies, hospitals or health care centers) that have
been previously included in the HNS through a specific authorization granted by the State Authorities.

181


-----

Medicines covered by the HNS do not include OTC medicines, but do include some prescription generics.
All medicines not included in the HNS can be priced freely on the open market but subject to a
communication issued to the State Authorities.

State Authorities (the Health Ministry) approve the prices and reimbursement conditions for the
authorized medicinal prescription products which apply all over the territory taking into account, mainly,
the characteristics of the pathologies involved, public expenditure rationalization, public budget impact,
the cost effectiveness analysis and the existence of similar medicinal products. Generally, the maximum
reimbursement price (referred to as the ‘‘Industry Price’’ below) will be equal to or below the price that
would apply if the corresponding medicinal products were dispensed to patients who are not beneficiaries
of the HNS. To settle the Industry Price, the pharmaceutical industry is obliged to provide to the State
Authorities all the information on technical, financial and economic matters related to the relevant
medicinal product.

Public reimbursement is subject to the reference price system (‘‘RPS’’) which is the maximum amount that
the corresponding prescribed medicinal product included in each medicinal group (same active
pharmaceutical ingredient and route of administration) will be public reimbursed, i.e. the RPS is a product
group pricing benchmark which will influence the Industry Price for an individual product where the
relevant product group has previously been allocated a reference price. The RPS is settled taking into
consideration the lowest cost/treatment/day of the medicinal products of each group. The retail price is
based on the RPS adding wholesale and pharmacy commercial margins, respectively, which are tightly
regulated by the State Authorities.

The Industry Price of a particular medicinal product represents the maximum price at which an HNS
medicine will be reimbursed at the manufacturing level. The marketing authorization holder who will
deliver into the supply chain (typically, to a wholesaler who will on-sell to a pharmacy) will therefore be
aware of the maximum price that it will collect. Wholesaler and pharmacies margins will be fixed by
legislation.

Retail price equals the Industry Price plus the wholesale and pharmacies commercial margins.

Once the Industry Price is fixed, it will be annually updated by the State Authorities and can be modified if
changes in the financial and technical circumstances or the evaluation of their therapeutic use obliges to.

State Authorities are entitled to proceed with the necessary inspections in order to verify if the maximum
prices are being adhered to and if they are not, State Authorities will likely initiate penalty proceedings
that may lead to the imposition of fines and the seizure of the medicinal products affected in case of
breach.

Pricing set in other jurisdictions cannot replace the relevant price in Spain as it is needed a particular
resolution issued by the State Authorities establishing the price which can be equal or different from the
price of other jurisdictions.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Russia_**

In Russia, there are two types of reimbursement schemes:

1. _For all in-patients and emergency care (under the Federal Fund for Mandatory Medical Insurance). This_
scheme covers all pharmaceutical products that a patient received in a hospital (e.g. prescription-only
medicines and any OTC medicines). The pharmaceutical products must be included in a standard of
care developed by MoH for the given disorder and in the so-called essential drugs list (VEP), a list of
drugs which should be made available in the in-patient setting, and which is used as the basis for a
number of out-patient reimbursement schemes (See ‘‘—VEP Circulation’’). In the case of an
individual patient not responding to treatment with a VEP medicine or having an adverse reaction to
a VEP, the medical panel may substitute a non-VEP medicine.

2. _For out-patients. The out-patients reimbursement schemes include: (a) the ONLS (Population Drug_
Coverage) scheme covering eligible categories of patients; (b) the VZN scheme (also referred to as
the ‘‘Seven Nosologies’’ scheme) covering patients with high-cost diseases, including mucoviscidosis
and multiple sclerosis, together referred to as the DLO scheme; and (c) other schemes also covering
certain groups of patients (e.g. patients suffering from orphan diseases, children under three years of
age, and others).

182


-----

Depending on the type of their entitlement the out-patients are eligible to receive either free or partially
subsidized prescription medicines. In order to receive benefits, some patients (e.g. veterans, disabled
persons) are required to present authorization documents confirming their status and can obtain a wide
range of drugs for different disorders. Other patients must be included in the federal register for specified
disorders and can only obtain the medicines that are included in the list of the drugs relevant to their
disorder.

The prescription is issued by a consulting physician. An out-patient can obtain necessary drugs in the
authorized (state or municipal) drugstores.

The general rules of VEP pricing are described in the Regulation section in respect of Russia (See ‘‘—VEP
_Circulation’’ above). A VEP drugs manufacturer can apply annually to re-register (to increase) the price_
under the rules set by the government to recover the manufacturer’s operating costs. Distributors and
drugstores can each apply a mark-up limited by the regional legislature. Federal and regional authorities
have the right to control retail prices and pricing during procurement procedures.

All reimbursable pharmaceutical products are purchased by hospitals and authorized drugstores solely
through public procurement procedures which tender for drugs by reference to their INN, their
compliance with the registered price (overpricing is prohibited) and which give priority to medicinal
products from the EAEU countries in an auction. OTC product pricing is not regulated by the state.

The Order of the Ministry of Health ‘‘On the Approval of the Public Pharmacare Strategy in the Russian
Federation till 2025 and its Implementation Schedule’’ declares a new reimbursement system in Russia, to
be implemented in the future. Pilot projects have been introduced in selected regions. For example Kirov
region has set up a co-payments scheme whereby a patient pays only 10% of the price of the cardiovascular
disease medicines with the remaining 90% being funded from the regional budget. Several other
reimbursement models are under consideration, including introduction of a reference pricing system of
interchangeable drugs under which patients, if they choose, will be required to pay any difference between
the reference price of the generic version and the actual price of the desired original product.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the course of its ordinary business activities, the Target Group enters into related party transactions with
its shareholders, key management personnel and associates. Such transactions generally involve arm’s
length agreements on market terms. In addition, it is contemplated that new related party transactions will
be entered into in connection with the Transactions.

**Transactions with Key Management Personnel**

As of December 31, 2016, members of our executive management control less than 0.1% of our voting
shares. Pursuant to German accounting standard DRS 17, our Executive Board received total
compensation of A7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. See ‘‘Management—Management of
_Target—Executive Board—Executive Board Compensation.’’_

Although we do not have a stock option plan in place, we maintain an employee share ownership program.
Under this program, we regularly sell a portion of our treasury shares to our employees. In the 2016 fiscal
year, we sold 2,216 shares at an average price of A36.31. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the
Sponsors intend to establish a management equity plan; see ‘‘Management—Share Ownership.’’

Certain members of our Supervisory Board and Advisory Board are self-employed and provide consulting
services to the Target Group on a regular basis. According to the Target, the amounts and transactions
involved are not material.

**Transactions with Related Companies**

For an overview of the material transactions between the Target Group and its related parties that affected
the Target Group’s financial position or net income as of and for each of the years ended December 31,
2014, 2015 and 2016, see our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.

The Target Group provides its associate, BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, in which the Target Group
holds an equity interest of approximately 15.86% as of December 31, 2016 with a revolving credit facility
that was undrawn as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 and drawn in an amount of A3.3 million as of
December 31, 2014. Interest on the facility accrues at a rate that we believe is typical for venture capital.

The Target Group is also party to a service contract and distribution rights agreement with
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG. Pursuant to the distribution rights agreement BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG licenses Epo-zeta in Germany to, among others, our subsidiary STADAPHARM. The
distribution rights agreement contemplates that other entities within our Target Group (in particular, our
Serbian and Russian subsidiaries) are or will in the future also be granted similar distribution rights.

The Target Group also has a business relationship with its partner in respect of its Chinese joint venture,
STADA Import/Export International Ltd. As of December 31, 2016, the Target has outstanding liabilities
of A0.6 million under a loan extended to the Target Group by its joint venture partner.

Transactions with Entities Affiliated with our Directors and Executive Management During the periods
under review, we entered into transactions with companies controlled in part by, or affiliated with, certain
of our directors or members of our executive management team. None of these transactions were material,
and all of these transactions were conducted in the ordinary course of our business.

‘‘Management—Share Ownership.’’

**Investors’ Agreement**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Sponsor Holdcos and Lux TopCo have entered into an investors’
agreement concerning the Sponsor Holdcos’ subscription for securities in Lux TopCo, and the rights and
obligations of the Sponsor Holdcos in connection with their investment in, and the governance of, Lux
TopCo and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Investors’ Agreement’’). The Investors’ Agreement provides for the
governance rules of Lux TopCo and its subsidiaries and sets forth certain corporate actions that may be
taken only with the consent of the representatives of the Sponsors. The Investors’ Agreement provides
certain protective rights, such as pre-emptive rights, to the Sponsor Holdcos in the event of an offering of
new equity or debt securities in Lux TopCo and/or its subsidiaries to any Sponsor Holdco or its affiliates
(the ‘‘Investor Securities’’), and offers certain tag-along rights and rights of first offer in the event of a
transfer of existing Investor Securities. Moreover, direct and indirect transfers of interests in the Investor
Securities are generally restricted for a period of five years, except for certain unrestricted transfers
(including, among other things, transfers to affiliates, indirect transfers pursuant to permitted syndications
or in connection with a management equity participation program for the benefit of the Target Group’s
senior management). The Investors’ Agreement also provides a framework for the Sponsors to jointly exit
from their investment in the Group.

Under the Investors’ Agreement each of Bain Holdco and Cinven Holdco have the right to appoint an
equal number of directors to the board of Lux TopCo, and resolutions of Lux TopCo require a simple
majority vote plus the affirmative vote of at least one director nominated by each of the Sponsor Holdcos
at meetings and each Sponsor Holdco has the right to replicate its representation and governance right on
the board of Lux TopCo on the boards of each of its subsidiaries. Each Sponsor is entitled to appoint

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, on August 17, 2017,
entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement with, among others, Barclays Bank PLC as
agent, the Security Agent, and Barclays Banks PLC, Nomura Bank International plc, UBS Limited,
Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG London Branch, ING Bank
NA, a branch of ING-DIBA AG, Jefferies Finance Europe SCSP, J.P. Morgan Limited and Soci´et´e
G´enerale S.A. Frankfurt Branch, as mandated lead arrangers. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of A400.0 million (the ‘‘Revolving
Credit Facility’’) and senior term loan facilities in principal amounts of A1,715.0 million (‘‘TLB1’’) and
A235.0 million (‘‘TLB2’’ and together with TLB1, ‘‘Facility B’’) (the Revolving Credit Facility, TLB1 and
TLB2 are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Senior Credit Facilities’’ for the purposes of this description).

TLB1 has been and may continue to be utilized by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, German Holdco and
certain of its restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement as
additional borrowers of that facility (the ‘‘TLB1 Borrowers’’) and may be applied in or towards: (i) directly
or indirectly, the consideration payable, or refinancing of the consideration paid or payable for the
acquisition of any shares and/or warrants in the Target (including the repayment of any loan made under
the Revolving Credit Facility to bridge such a purchase); (ii) the refinancing or otherwise discharging of
certain existing indebtedness of the Target and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Existing Target Debt’’) and payments
of related breakage costs and any other costs related to such refinancing; (iii) financing the payment
directly or indirectly of certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition;
(iv) any other purpose contemplated by the funds flow statement and/or tax structure memorandum
relating to the Acquisition; and (v) the payment into certain escrow accounts for application towards the
purposes described in the preceding sub-paragraphs within certain prescribed timeframes.

At the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, TLB1 Commitments have been requested to be redenominated from euros
into sterling in an amount equal to A300 million (such redenominated commitments being ‘‘TLB1-GBP’’).

TLB2 may be utilized by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, German Holdco and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries which accede to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement as additional borrowers of
that facility (the ‘‘TLB2 Borrowers’’) and may be used to finance: (i) the refinancing or otherwise
discharging of the Existing Target Debt, payments of related breakage costs and any other costs related to
such refinancing; (ii) any other purpose contemplated by the funds flow statement and/or tax structure
memorandum relating to the Existing Target Debt; and (iii) the payment into certain escrow accounts for
application towards the purposes described in the preceding sub-paragraphs.

The Revolving Credit Facility has been and may continue to be utilized by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
German Holdco and certain of its restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement as additional borrowers (the ‘‘RCF Borrowers’’), in euros, sterling, U.S. dollars and
certain other currencies readily available in the relevant interbank market (subject to obtaining the consent
of all the relevant Revolving Credit Facility lenders) by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of
credit and ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis).

The Revolving Credit Facility may be used for: (i) the general corporate purposes and/or working capital
requirements of the Group (including any costs in connection with an acquisition of shares in the Target);
(ii) any payments required pursuant to or in connection with any domination and profit and loss pooling
agreement which may be entered into between the Target and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or
certain other entities (the ‘‘Domination Agreement’’) or any payments in connection with a squeeze out
procedure to acquire shares in the Target pursuant to German law; (iii) financing the purchase price for
the acquisition of any Target shares and/or warrants in each case to the extent required to bridge such
purchase price pending a receipt by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of an equity contribution or a loan
under TLB1; (iv) any other purpose contemplated by the tax structure memorandum relating to the
Acquisition and/or the refinancing of the Existing Target Debt; and (v) financing any amount of any
increase in the offer price in respect of shares in the Target as a result of the settlement date in respect of
those shares occurring prior to the date on which the FY2016 profit distribution is paid by the Target.

-----

In addition to the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility B, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
includes (in addition to other permissions under the limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability
(without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness covenant) to incur additional
indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement and/or any additional notes and/or other facilities or notes documented
outside the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) up to an aggregate amount of the greater of
A500.0 million and 100% of LTM EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
and subject to certain customary additions including the amount of prepayments and buy-backs), plus an
unlimited amount, provided that, pro forma for the incurrence of such additional facilities or permitted
alternative debt: (i) if such indebtedness is secured on the Collateral, and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement such that such liabilities rank _pari passu with Facility B, the consolidated senior secured net_
leverage ratio (as described in the ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’) does not exceed 5.00:1; or
(ii) if the indebtedness does not fall within paragraph (i), the fixed charge coverage ratio does not exceed
2.00:1, and in each case, subject to certain other conditions being met.

**_Availability_**

Facility B will be available on and from the date of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement up to
(and including) close of business (in Frankfurt) on July 10, 2018.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) August 21, 2017 (the ‘‘Closing Date’’)
to (and including) the date which is one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Senior Credit Facilities and escrow withdrawals are subject to customary conditions
precedent.

**_Control Limitations_**

Prior to the Control Date, where any term of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is expressed
to apply, directly or indirectly, to the Target Group (or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has undertaken to
procure compliance to any such term) such term shall be subject to substantially equivalent limitations on
control of the Target Group which may be exercised by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as set out in the
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes.’’

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Credit Facilities will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR
or, for loans denominated other than in Euro, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which in each case will
be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) (the
‘‘Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio’’).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
Facility B or the Revolving Credit Facility (as applicable). If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility or TLB1-GBP (as
applicable).

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment
fees will be payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or
on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under Facility B will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.
In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the
Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling six years from the Closing Date. Amounts repaid

192


-----

by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain
conditions.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to
_de minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances,_
including:

- on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (with the percentage of
proceeds to be prepaid subject to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) (a ‘‘Listing Prepayment’’);

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the Senior Secured Group from certain asset disposals, to
the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of
the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount; and

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, for each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing
Date), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum
threshold amount (subject to certain adjustments based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be
paid to minority shareholders and certain other expenses), which percentage decreases as the Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio decreases (an ‘‘Excess Cash Flow Prepayment’’).

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement), each lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a prescribed
time period. A change of control shall include:

- any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer other than in connection with a transaction or series of transactions in
which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a parent entity (as
defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

- the Senior Notes Issuer ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer (or any successor entity as a result of certain mergers);

- prior to certain potential mergers of the Target permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Holdco ceasing to (directly or indirectly) own
a percentage of the issued share capital of the Target (excluding treasury shares) at least equal to 60%
of such total issued share capital;

- following certain potential mergers of the Target permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer ceasing to (directly or indirectly) own a percentage of the
issued share capital of German Holdco at least equal to 60% of such total issued share capital; and

- on a disposal of substantially all the business of the Senior Secured Group.

At the election of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing
Prepayment or an Excess Cash Flow Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of any other
indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group ranking pari passu with Facility B.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Senior Credit Facilities are currently guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German
Holdco, and are secured by first ranking pledges over (i) the share capital of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer held by the Senior Notes Issuer; (ii) the share capital of German Holdco by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer; (iii) the material bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and German Holdco;

Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Senior Secured
Group that generate at least 80% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled
‘‘Description of the Notes’’) are guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (i) on

the date which is 120 days after the earlier of (A) the date on which the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
are first utilized by the Target or one of its subsidiaries; and (B) the Control Date; and (ii) thereafter on
the date when the annual financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are required to be
delivered to the agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the
other matters set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

undertakings and related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including (i) limitations on

on designating certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations secured on the Collateral as Super Senior
Liabilities (as defined in the section entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’) unless, prior to such designation, Facility B has been refinanced in full (ignoring any_
participation (x) of a lender which has been rolled over in a refinancing (or otherwise) of Facility B and/or

affiliate transactions; (vii) merger and consolidation; (viii) suspension of covenants on achievement of
investment grade status; (ix) additional guarantees and intercreditor agreements; (x) no impairment of

under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank
guarantees) or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any agreed fees in connection with the
syndication of the Senior Credit Facilities) exceeds 35 per cent of the total commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility on the relevant testing date or, if higher, the total commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the
‘‘Revolving Test Condition’’), the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 8.75 to 1.00. The
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent
definitions described in this offering memorandum.

194


-----

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the
shareholders of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or
equity to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to (i) increase the consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (ii) decrease consolidated senior secured net debt as defined
in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, or (iii) prepay the Revolving Credit Facility so that the
Revolving Test Condition is no longer satisfied. The equity cure right may not be exercised on more than
five occasions during the term of the Senior Credit Facilities and may not be utilized in consecutive
quarters.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement will fall-away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a
listing in respect of which the TLB Group’s ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated pro forma
EBITDA does not exceed an agreed ratio; (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer having a long-term
corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor Services Limited or
BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; or (iii) Facility B has achieved and maintained
investment grade status.

In addition, any utilization of Facility B (or withdrawal from the relevant escrow account) prior to the
Control Entry Date where the proceeds of such utilization are to be applied towards the consideration
payable for any shares and/or warrants in the Target (including the prepayment/repayment of any
utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility used to bridge such acquisition) will be subject to a maximum
leverage condition as described in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as
under the Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for additional
events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) breach of
the financial covenant, provided that, in the event of such breach, only a majority of the Lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility shall initially be entitled to take enforcement action; (ii) inaccuracy of a
representation or statement when made; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Credit Facilities
financing documents; and (iv) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with
English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related
definitions scheduled to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance
with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is
governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and certain Guarantors are party to and certain other
Guarantors and the Trustee will accede to an Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent,
arrangers and lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to
the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, when payments can be made in
respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in
respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the

of shared security.

‘‘Third Party Security Provider’’ means the Senior Notes Issuer and any person that is not a member of the
Senior Secured Group that has provided Transaction Security (including Topco Shared Security) but is not
a Debtor in respect of any direct borrowing or guarantee liabilities of the applicable secured obligations to
which that Transaction Security relates and which is designated by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in its
discretion).

‘‘Transaction Security’’ refers to security (from the Senior Secured Group, any Third Party Security
Provider and Topco Shared Security (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Topco Independent
Transaction Security), as defined below) which is created, or expressed to be created, in favor of the
Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or if such trustee arrangements are not
legally possible, in favor of all the Secured Parties or in favor of the Security Agent under a parallel debt or
similar structure). Transaction Security which is not Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and
present and future obligations of the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties
(other than the creditors under the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Topco Secured Parties’’)) under the Debt
Documents (other than the finance documents relating to the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Topco Finance
Documents’’)).

‘‘Topco Shared Security’’ refers to security at any time which is created, or expressed to be created, over
(a) each of (i) the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by the Senior Notes Issuer and (ii) all

receivables owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group under any Topco Proceeds Loan (or, in the
case of a Topco Borrower which is a member of the Senior Secured Group, any Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loan), (v) any escrow account relating to the proceeds of any Topco Liabilities and (vi), any
other assets not falling within limbs (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph of a Topco Borrower
which is a member of the Senior Secured Group, in each case to the extent provided for by the Topco
Finance Documents at any time and designated as Topco Shared Security by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (in its discretion) in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or
if such trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favor of all the Secured Parties or in favor of the
Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure). Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities
and present and future obligations of each Topco Borrower that is not a member of the Senior Secured
Group and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the documents governing the relevant Topco
Notes or Topco Facility (as the case may be)) (the ‘‘Topco Group’’), each Debtor and each Third Party
Security Provider to the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents.

‘‘Topco Independent Transaction Security’’ refers to security (other than Transaction Security) which is

Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Topco Secured Parties (or if such trustee arrangements are
not legally possible, in favor of all the Topco Secured Parties or in favor of the Security Agent under a
parallel debt or similar structure). Topco Independent Transaction Security shall secure all liabilities and
present and future obligations of each Topco Independent Obligor to the Topco Secured Parties under the
Topco Finance Documents.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes and Senior Notes
Guarantee will be Topco Notes Liabilities for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Designation Date has not occurred. On the Issue Date, no Second Lien Lender Liabilities or Second Lien
Notes Liabilities will be outstanding. Such liabilities and liabilities in respect of other new debt financings
may only be incurred and/or designated if not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents,
including, without limitation, the covenants applicable to the Notes described under ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.’’_

respect of the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in the original
form of any Topco Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or given to all the Secured
Parties as security for the liabilities of the Topco Group, each Debtor and any Third Party Security
Provider to the Secured Parties under the Debt Documents if, subject to any agreed security
principles:

(A) (except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance permitted by the Finance Documents),
the Secured Parties other than the Topco Creditors (the ‘‘Priority Secured Parties’’) already
benefit from such a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance or at the same time it is also offered
to the Priority Secured Parties and ranks in the same order of priority as described under ‘‘—
_Priority of Debts’’ above, as applicable; and_

(B) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management
Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities
or Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities (each a ‘‘New Debt Financing’’). The conditions include certification by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the
Finance Documents.

199


-----

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement
under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt
Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other
person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document)
is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term
of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards
the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
otherwise required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the extent that the existing Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security is not being amended or released and the new Transaction
Security or new Topco Independent Transaction Security only secures the New Debt Financing,
substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (‘‘Permitted Acquired Indebtedness’’) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries
who, after the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise
combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is
otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an ‘‘Acquired Person or Asset’’), any security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is
subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any
condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt
Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any
member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any
Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or
is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide
credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation
to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or
(iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by
the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation
(including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security
rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility
Liabilities (together with the Hedging Liabilities, the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,’’ the creditors in
respect thereof being the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditors’’) at any time, _provided that following certain_
acceleration events under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or
following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may
only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with
the provisions described below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ provided that after the Designation Date
there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an
enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the
Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under
such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

200


-----

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the ‘‘Senior Secured Liabilities’’ and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the ‘‘Secured Liabilities’’) have been discharged (the ‘‘Senior
Secured Discharge Date’’), the Debtors may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the
Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities,
subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured
Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no
payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no
payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or
certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes
document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of
the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the ‘‘Second
Lien Discharge Date’’) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the ‘‘Priority Discharge
Date’’), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other
members of the Senior Secured Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including any other
direct or indirect step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited
under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan
(together the ‘‘Topco Group Liabilities’’) to the Topco Creditors or any holding company of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco
Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such payments, collectively, ‘‘Permitted Topco Payments’’):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a _de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than_
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash
Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a ‘‘Senior Secured Payment
Default’’), or under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a ‘‘Second Lien Payment
Default’’); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit
such payment have been obtained, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or
capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if
applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages))) and default interest on the Topco Liabilities
accrued and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance
Document (as at the date of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a
result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of
currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back

and Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any
syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

201


-----

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other
than in respect of paragraph (M) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien
Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or
borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (K)
below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their
debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements
(in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is
(without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not
permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the
Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for
restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate
financial and/or restructuring advisors) and a Topco Agent’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding
A1,500,000, but excluding the costs of any litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien
Creditor (or their affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of
costs necessary to protect, preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes,

fees) and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance
Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance
Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding A2,500,000 in any twelve month period, (G) of
any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding)
which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that
amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco
Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such
payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities
or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an
event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group
Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise
discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer (a ‘‘Debt for Equity Swap’’) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is
made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in
any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a
member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the
Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that arise
as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and
Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors
and Second Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group
Liabilities or Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of
non-cash interest made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is
subordinated on the same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) if the payment is funded directly or
indirectly with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance
Documents, (K) if the payment is made by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the
Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of
the Senior Secured Group or such payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower
from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents unless the Topco
Borrower is a guarantor or borrower of any prior ranking debt facilities at such time and any such
prior ranking debt facility has been accelerated or an Insolvency Event has occurred; (L) if the
payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a
Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a
single lender in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and
(M) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the
final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier
than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of
first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities; or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give
prior consent to that payment being made.

202


-----

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the
occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a ‘‘Senior Secured Event of
Default’’) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a ‘‘Second Lien Event of Default’’), the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured
Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
‘‘Topco Payment Stop Notice’’) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the ‘‘Topco Agent’’) and the trustee
under any Topco Notes (the ‘‘Topco Notes Trustee’’) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or
Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the
Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant
stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco
Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Permitted Topco Enforcement’’ below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant
event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure
to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement
notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group
Liabilities (a ‘‘Topco Enforcement Notice’’) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and
capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

203


-----

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that
has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the ‘‘Topco
Investors’’) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the
‘‘Topco Discharge Date’’) (the ‘‘Final Discharge Date’’) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor
on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third
Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under ‘‘Application of Proceeds’’; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of
_Proceeds’’ and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect_
of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered)
on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any)
by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers

204


-----

from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any
proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following
an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged
property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent
except in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

‘‘Insolvency Event’’ is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or
making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization,
(b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other
than any Secured Party), (c) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the
appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other
similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any
jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments
which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior
Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted
Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not
constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled
to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security
Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent
such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution
to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been
paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the
provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case
of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such
set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that
set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application
_of Proceeds’’ below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands,
collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Senior Secured Group or
Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests
in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of
an Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable)
otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

An ‘‘Instructing Group’’ means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

205


-----

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco
Creditors; and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Super Senior Discharge Date’’),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of
the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the ‘‘Majority Senior
Secured Creditors’’), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super
Senior Secured Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) save that, for instructions
relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions
in accordance with the enforcement regime described under ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction
_Security Prior to the Designation Date’’ and ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the_
_Designation Date’’ below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of
the Second Lien Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Second Lien Creditors’’); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Topco Creditors’’).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce
or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to
enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or
have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor
or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may
give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the
Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or
representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to
give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions
received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good
faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before
giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the
creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided
that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco
Shared Security) for a period of up to ten Business Days or take any Enforcement Action (the
‘‘Consultation Period’’) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give the enforcement instructions
described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such Consultation Period.

206


-----

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the
Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those
instructions (an ‘‘Initial Enforcement Notice’’) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement
they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or
the Super Senior Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the
Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency
Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a
Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the
method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds
and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the
Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date
and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to
enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the ‘‘Second Lien
Agent’’) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second
Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority
Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the
Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such
instruction or indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions
as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction
Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

‘‘Enforcement Principles’’ means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement
chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received
in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over A5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a
public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is request to do so by the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion
from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or

207


-----

Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any
persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising
under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the
paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under ‘‘—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors’’ will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security
securing the Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
‘‘Relevant Topco Default’’) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes
Trustee or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice
notifying any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the ‘‘Senior Agent’’), senior
secured notes trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such
event of default.

‘‘Topco Standstill Period’’ means the period beginning on the date (the ‘‘Topco Standstill Start Date’’) a

earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the ‘‘Topco Standstill Period’’);

Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same

209


-----

Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve
or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco

remedy).

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in
relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any
later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of
the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect to
purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,
Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities
for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus
certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to
transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount
that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus
certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall

instruction from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written
request from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of
any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security;

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that asset
will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
‘‘Non-Distressed Disposal’’);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance
Document to effect any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligation or take any action in relation to such document or agreement;

210


-----

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of
the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the
extent that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or
guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent

or such release in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement); and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, other member of the Senior
Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease
to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or
other member of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities
under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from
the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt
Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not
prohibited as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or
the relevant release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of
the Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or
a Debtor, to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not
prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower,
issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay
all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

‘‘Distressed Disposal’’ means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any Transaction
Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the
Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the
Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration
event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without
any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor
Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities;
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

211


-----

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of
its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding
company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of
an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors
and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities (the ‘‘Transferee’’) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part
only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the ‘‘Disposed Entity’’) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the ‘‘Receiving Entity’’) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities)
to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities,
liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set
out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of
the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of
liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing
market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

212


-----

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities would otherwise be
released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those
borrowing liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in which case
the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or
Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being
effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares
in a borrower or issuer of, or over assets of a borrower or issuer of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco
Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release
that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor (a ‘‘Second Lien Guarantor’’) in respect of
Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other
marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially
in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance
with the provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Parties (other than in relation to performance bonds, guarantees or
similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of the Senior Secured
Group) against a member of the Senior Secured Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than
any minority interest not owned by members of the Senior Secured Group) are pledged in favor
of the Priority Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security, Topco
Independent Transaction Security or other security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of
the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and
discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such
claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and
any senior secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged but
nevertheless less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice on
the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security
Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer

Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an

including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such investment bank,
firm of accountants or third party professional firm in giving such opinion may be limited to

is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider; and

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the
first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the ‘‘Enforcement Date’’) and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured
Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only
affects one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected
materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from
the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ above and the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of
(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the
Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,
(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver
would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender
under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of
any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent that the
proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge
Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions
or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized
to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its
capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
may, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party and the prior consent of the
Secured Parties is required to authorize any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any
document creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets

216


-----

subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without
limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement)
may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents’’ are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in_
particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or
consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under
‘‘—New Debt Financings,’’ ‘‘Non-Distressed Disposals’’ and ‘‘—Distressed Disposals’’ above. Any release,
amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents
relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action
or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
creditor fails to respond to the request within ten Business Days (or any other period of time notified by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a
shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor will be
disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have
provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an ‘‘IPO’’), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all
related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the
‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity,’’ and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such
IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer which is
the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio
calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain
provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will
cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security
Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent
Obligor will be released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the
appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of
any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each
subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor
under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing
liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment,
release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

217


-----

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Documents to the contrary (other than any Transaction Security documents which are governed by
German law and need to be notarized (beurkundet)).

**Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, as borrower, entered into a senior bridge facility agreement on
August 17, 2017, among, _inter alios, Barclays Bank PLC, as agent, and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as_
security agent. The committed amount of A485.0 million was funded under the Senior Secured Bridge
Facility Agreement on August 22, 2017. The proceeds from the Senior Secured Bridge Facility were used to
pay a portion of the purchase price for the shares of the Target purchased on the First Settlement Date and
to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the funding of the Bridge Facilities and the Takeover
Offer. The Senior Secured Bridge Facility governed by the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement
matures on August 22, 2018, when, absent the occurrence of certain events of default thereunder, the
obligations under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement will convert into a long-term loan
maturing on August 22, 2024. The borrowings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement will be
repaid at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the proceeds from the Senior Secured Notes offered
in this Offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility Agreement**

The Senior Notes Issuer, as borrower, entered into a senior unsecured bridge facility agreement on
August 17, 2017, among, _inter alios, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, as original guarantor, Barclays_
Bank PLC, as agent, and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent. The committed amount of
A340.0 million was funded under the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility Agreement on August 22, 2017. The
proceeds from the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility were lent to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by way
of a loan from the Senior Notes Issuer to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and were used to pay a portion
of the purchase price for the shares of the Target purchased on the First Settlement Date and to pay
certain fees and expenses in connection with the funding of the Bridge Facilities and the Takeover Offer.
The Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility governed by the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility Agreement
matures on August 22, 2018, when, absent the occurrence of certain events of default thereunder, the
obligations under the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility Agreement will convert into a long-term loan
maturing on August 22, 2025. The borrowings under the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility Agreement will
be repaid at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the proceeds from the Senior Notes offered in this
Offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**Notes**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have outstanding indebtedness under two series of notes.
The terms and conditions of each series include a change of control provision, which we expect will entitle
each holder of the relevant series of notes to require the Target to redeem each note held by such holder at
par following the First Settlement Date. In addition, STADA may redeem each series of notes in the event
of certain adverse changes in taxation. Each series of notes also provides for a customary negative pledge
clause which limits the ability of STADA and its material subsidiaries to incur liens on their respective
assets to secure certain other indebtedness, without simultaneously securing the relevant series of notes on
an equal and ratable basis. The terms and conditions governing each series provide for customary events of
default. The most significant other terms of each series of notes are set forth below.

**_2018 Notes_**

On May 29, 2013, STADA Arzneimittel AG issued A350 million in aggregate principal amount of senior
unsecured notes (the ‘‘2018 Notes’’). The 2018 Notes mature on June 5, 2018, and bear interest at a fixed
rate of 2.25% per annum. The 2018 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Target, ranking _pari_
_passu among themselves and pari passu with all other senior unsecured obligations of the Target. The net_
proceeds of the 2018 Notes were used for general financing purposes.

**_2022 Notes_**

On May 31, 2015, STADA Arzneimittel AG issued A300 million in aggregate principal amount of senior
unsecured notes (the ‘‘2022 Notes’’). The 2022 Notes mature on April 8, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed

218


-----

rate of 1.75% per annum. The 2022 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Target, ranking _pari_
_passu among themselves and_ _pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the_
Target. The net proceeds of the 2022 Notes were used for general corporate purposes and, in particular, to
refinance senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of A350 million, which matured on
April 21, 2015.

**Loan Agreements**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have outstanding indebtedness under two loan
agreements with reputable banks, the details of which are set forth below. Each of these agreements
provides for a change of control provision, which we expect will entitle the lender to terminate the loan and
demand repayment at par following the First Settlement Date. In addition, each such agreement contains a
customary negative pledge clause which limits the ability of STADA and its material subsidiaries to incur
liens on their respective assets to secure certain other indebtedness, without simultaneously securing the
relevant loan on an equal and ratable basis.

STADA Arzneimittel AG entered into the first loan agreement in October 2013. The agreement provides
for a senior unsecured term loan in a principal amount of A40 million. The net proceeds were used to
finance STADA’s internationalization. Interest on the loan accrues at a variable rate equal to Euribor plus
a customary margin. At each interest payment date, the loan may be prepaid at the borrower’s election at
par in full or in minimum increments of A1 million. As of June 30, 2017, an amount of A40 million was
outstanding under this loan agreement. Any amounts outstanding under the loan must be repaid in full in
October 2017. The loan agreement provides for customary events of default (including changes in
STADA’s corporate form and its entry into affiliation agreements (Unternehmensvertr¨age) such as the
DPLTA).

STADA Arzneimittel AG entered into the second loan agreement in December 2014. The agreement
provides for a senior unsecured term loan in a principal amount of A25 million for the purpose of financing
STADA’s ordinary course working capital requirements. Interest on the loan accrues at a customary fixed
rate. At each interest payment date, the loan may be prepaid at the borrower’s election at par in full or in
certain minimum increments. As of June 30, 2017, an amount of A25 million was outstanding under this
loan agreement. Any amounts outstanding under the loan must be repaid in full in November 2018. The
loan agreement provides for customary events of default.

As of June 30, 2017, STADA Arzneimittel AG had available credit facilities in an aggregate principal
amount of A515 million, which have been provided by several German and international banks. Most of
these credit facilities are committed and subject to a tenor of one year. A portion of such facilities contains
a change of control clause or termination clause that is triggered in the event of a change of control. Due
to sufficient alternative sources of cash and cash equivalents being available to STADA, such credit
facilities are currently undrawn, except for the utilization of guarantee and letter of credit facilities in an
aggregate principal amount equal to A4.8 million. We expect to terminate such credit facilities in light of
the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility following the Acquisition.

**Promissory Notes Loan Agreements (Schuldscheindarlehen)**

STADA Arzneimittel AG entered into ten promissory loan notes agreements (Schuldscheindarlehen) with
various lenders. Each of these ten agreements provides for the issuance of senior unsecured promissory
loan notes and contains a change of control provision, which we expect will entitle the lenders to terminate
the loan notes following the First Settlement Date and demand repayment at par. In addition, each
agreement provides for a customary negative pledge clause which limits the ability of STADA and its
material subsidiaries to incur liens on their respective assets to secure certain other indebtedness, without
simultaneously securing the loan notes on an equal and ratable basis. We believe that lenders who waive
their right to repayment upon a change of control will require us to secure indebtedness outstanding under
the relevant loan notes _pari passu with the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If certain customary_
events of default set forth in each agreement occur, then the entire aggregate principal amount of loan
notes under such agreement becomes due and payable. The most significant other terms of each
agreement are set forth below.

The first promissory loan notes agreement provides for the issuance of promissory loan notes in an
aggregate principal amount of A124 million and was entered into in January 2014. Interest on the loan

option, except in the event of certain adverse changes in taxation. As of June 30, 2017, an amount of

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

The following is a description of the A735.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Senior Secured
Notes due 2024 (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’). The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Nidda
Healthcare Holding AG (the ‘‘Issuer’’). You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ under the heading ‘‘Certain Definitions’’ below. For purposes of
this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Issuer,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer only to
Nidda Healthcare Holding AG and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about September 29,
2017 (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Indenture’’), between, _inter alios, the Issuer, Nidda Healthcare GmbH_
(‘‘German Holdco’’ or the ‘‘Initial Guarantor’’), as guarantor, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in
such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’) and as security agent (in such capacity, the ‘‘Security Agent’’), and Elavon
Financial Services DAC, UK Branch, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified
under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections
provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture,
including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of
interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be
used by the Issuer, together with cash on hand, to repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured
Bridge Facility and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering and issuance of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The proceeds from the Bridge Facilities, together with
proceeds from the Senior Term Loan, were drawn on August 22, 2017, to finance the acquisition by Bain
Capital and Cinven (together with certain co-investors, including Partners Group AG) of approximately
64% of the Target’s issued and outstanding common shares in a voluntary public tender offer (Freiwilliges
_¨Ubernahmeangebot) (the ‘‘Offer’’) by the Issuer for the Target Shares, and to pay certain fees and expenses_
related to the Transactions. The remaining portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured
Notes will be deposited into a secured account for future utilization. See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions.’’

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will
only be obligations of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantor and will not be guaranteed by the Target or any
of its Subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date, the
Target and certain of its Subsidiaries organized in Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (the ‘‘Post-Control Date Guarantors’’) are expected to enter into
one or more supplemental indentures to become a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
guarantee the Senior Secured Notes on a senior secured basis on the earlier of (a) the date on which a
Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and (b) 120 days from the
Control Date.

Prior to the Control Date, the Issuer may not be able to cause the Target Group to comply with the
covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ or other agreements under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture due to statutory limitations on the influence of shareholders on a publicly listed
German company such as the Target. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Control Date, the
Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture had those covenants or other agreements been applicable to such entities
as of the Issue Date, and any such non-compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Acknowledgment of Control Limitations.’’

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which
A735 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be issued in this offering. We may,
subject to applicable law and the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, issue an unlimited principal
amount of additional Senior Secured Notes having identical terms and conditions (other than price) as the
Senior Secured Notes (any such additional Senior Secured Notes actually issued, the ‘‘Additional Senior
_Secured Notes’’);_ _provided that if any series of Additional Senior Secured Notes is not fungible for U.S._
federal income tax purposes with the Senior Secured Notes, such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be
issued with a separate ISIN code or common code from the Senior Secured Notes originally issued. We will
only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the Incurrence of Liens. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain

223


-----

_Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,_
the Senior Secured Notes, and if issued, Additional Senior Secured Notes, will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’ include the Senior
Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of
the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain
indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents for complete
descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents will be available
from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without
limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have
not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer
restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including obligations of the Issuer
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Senior Notes
Guarantees;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

- be (i) guaranteed by the Initial Guarantor on a senior secured basis on the Issue Date and (ii) subject
to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date, on the earlier of (a) the
date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and
(b) 120 days from the Control Date be guaranteed by such Post-Control Date Guarantors, in each
case, on a senior basis;

- mature on September 30, 2024; and

224


-----

- be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined below).
See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations; provided, however, that
the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a ‘‘super senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of
the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior hedging obligations) have been
paid in full. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

The Issuer is a holding company incorporated for the purposes of the Transactions, and the Issuer’s only
material assets are its indirect interests in the Target Group held through its Subsidiary, German Holdco.
All of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. Therefore, after the Issue
Date, the Issuer will depend on the receipt of funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in the form of
dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with respect to intercompany obligations) to
meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes
will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and
commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, German Holdco, the Target and all of the Target’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted
_Subsidiaries’’ for the purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances_
described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ we will
be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ Our Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (and assuming that all of the Existing
Target Debt Financing has been repaid by drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and cash and
cash equivalents of the Target Group), the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had
A2,435 million of Indebtedness secured with a first-priority Lien on the Collateral, consisting of
A1,700.0 million of drawings under the Senior Term Loans and A735.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes. As of September 22, 2017, the Issuer has drawn A37 million under the
Revolving Credit Facility and A250 million under the Senior Term Loans.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantor on a senior
secured basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date, on the
earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior
Facilities and (b) 120 days from the Control Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior
secured basis by the Post-Control Date Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described
under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.

Once granted, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of that Guarantor
(including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including the Senior Notes
Guarantees;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor and
its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the

225


-----

Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to
prevent the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law.
In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed
Security Principles as described below under ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—General.’’ By virtue of
these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively
no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series
_of Notes—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as_
_the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes_
Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.’’_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue A735.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on September 30, 2024. The Senior Secured Notes will be
issued in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. While
the Senior Secured Notes may only be traded in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of
A1,000 in excess thereof, for the purpose of the International Central Securities Depositories (‘‘ICSDs’’),
the minimum denomination will be considered to be A1. For the avoidance of doubt, the ICSDs are not
required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount.

The Senior Secured Notes (together with any Additional Senior Secured Notes) will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including in respect of any amendment,
waiver or other modification of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any other action by the Holders
hereunder, except as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1%
higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

**_Interest on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.50% per annum. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 30 and September 30, commencing on
March 30, 2018. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such
Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has
already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any
Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day
at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payment on such
Senior Secured Notes will be subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable.

226


-----

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (as defined
below) will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee
for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (‘‘Definitive
_Registered Senior Secured Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying_
Agents maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address
of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured Notes for the
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes’’
below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes in London, United
Kingdom (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services
DAC, UK Branch (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The
initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the
Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will
facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Senior Secured
Notes shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of
Senior Secured Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the
register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. However,
for so long as Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange
Authority Limited (the ‘‘Exchange’’) and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be
guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Initial Guarantor. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and the occurrence of the Control Date, the Post-Control Date Guarantors will guarantee, jointly and
severally, on a senior secured basis (each (including the Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes by the
Initial Guarantor), a ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantee’’ and together (including the Guarantee of the
Senior Secured Notes by the Initial Guarantor), the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantees’’) the obligations of
the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a
Change of Control, on the earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a
guarantee of the Senior Facilities and (b) 120 days from the Control Date.

The Target and substantially all of the Subsidiaries of the Target that are organized in Germany, England
and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are expected to become
Post-Control Date Guarantors.

In addition, as described under _‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’ and subject to the_
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer
or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior secured notes indenture as a Guarantor and
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by
general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit
rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title
claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

227


-----

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under
the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations_
_on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_the Collateral’’ and_ _‘‘—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as_
_favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are_
_familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance_
_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.’’_

A portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to
become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted
over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles, such as those Subsidiaries organized in
Russia, Serbia and Vietnam. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade
creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries
of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the
Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of
non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, Subsidiaries organized in Germany, England and
Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland accounted for 40% of the
consolidated assets, 38% of the consolidated sales and 47% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target
Group. After giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, as of June 30, 2017, the Issuer’s Subsidiaries_
organized in Serbia would have had A53 million in third party financial Indebtedness (excluding finance
leases). Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the
issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. See
‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.’’

No assurances may be given that the Control Date will occur, and if the Control Date does not occur, the
Post-Control Date Guarantors may not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes or provide any Security
Interests in respect of their property. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior
_Secured Notes Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the_
_Control Date.’’ As of June 30, 2017, prior to giving effect to the Transactions, the Target and its Subsidiaries_
had A1,432 million of third-party Indebtedness outstanding.

**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

- upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

228


-----

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction
_and Discharge’’;_

- pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

- as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees’’;_

- upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes;
or

- as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘Merger and Consolidation.’’

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, including the
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or
consent on the part of the Trustee.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees in respect thereof:

- on the Issue Date, will be secured on a first-priority basis by Security Interests in a pledge of the
shares in the Issuer, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the
Issuer to the Company, a pledge of the material bank accounts of the Issuer, a pledge of the shares in
German Holdco, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by German
Holdco to the Issuer, a pledge of the material bank accounts of German Holdco, a pledge of the
shares in the Target acquired by German Holdco and a security assignment of any structural
intercompany receivables owed by the Target to the Issuer or German Holdco and a security
assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by any material subsidiary
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) (together, the ‘‘Senior Secured Issue Date Collateral’’).
The Senior Secured Issue Date Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging
Obligations, if any, on a first-priority basis. The Senior Notes will also be secured on a second-priority
basis by Security Interests in a pledge of the shares in the Issuer and a security assignment of any
structural intercompany receivables owed by the Issuer to the Company.

Furthermore, the Issuer will, and will cause its Subsidiaries, in each case subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date:

- no later than 120 days from the Control Date and substantially simultaneously with the granting of
Security Interests in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities, grant first-priority Security
Interests in pledges of the shares in and material bank accounts of each Post-Control Date Guarantor
(together, the ‘‘Senior Secured Post-Control Date Collateral’’ and together with the Senior Secured
Issue Date Collateral and any and all other assets from time to time in which a Security Interest has
been or will be granted pursuant to any Senior Secured Security Document to secure the obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and/or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee, the ‘‘Collateral’’).

The Senior Secured Post-Control Date Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging
Obligations on a first-priority basis. The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security
Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Senior Secured Security Documents.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Issuer and_
the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future
issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain
requirements described herein, Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Senior Secured

229


-----

Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may be
re-designated as a ‘‘super senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such
re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the
obligations thereunder (and certain super senior hedging obligations) have been paid in full. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—
_Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Senior Secured Security Documents to the Security Agent
on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral.
Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
would also constitute ‘‘Collateral.’’ All Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge_
over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, ‘‘transfer pricing,’’ ‘‘thin capitalization,’’ ‘‘earnings
stripping,’’ ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’ and other tax restrictions, ‘‘exchange control
restrictions,’’ ‘‘capital maintenance’’ rules and ‘‘liquidity impairment’’ rules, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘‘Group’’) to provide a guarantee or security or
may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the
guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security
Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the
Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact
on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or
security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility,
stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the
relevant guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection
and/or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties
of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract,
lease, license, instrument or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset
from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring
a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which,
if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in
respect of the asset or require the relevant charger to take any action materially adverse to the
interests of the Group or any member thereof; _provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a_
specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be
used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession
document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve
placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

230


-----

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within
the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or
statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual
prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal
liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, _provided that, to the extent_
requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession
document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security
Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security
documents for all the secured creditors); _provided that it shall be permissible to use ‘‘parallel debt’’_
provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the
individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no member of the Group shall
be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or
transfer of the Senior Secured Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent, and the agreement that where a class of assets to be
secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial
assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material
assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third
party or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be
excluded from any relevant security document);

- the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of
assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or
sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security will not be
required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or
any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group;

- that agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending,
waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to
an Event of Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the Agreed
Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject
to the Agreed Security Principles; and

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or
other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or in
Russia, Serbia or Vietnam (the ‘‘Excluded Jurisdictions’’) or otherwise over the shares of a member of
the Group located in an Excluded Jurisdiction.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities as well as
certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Senior Secured Notes and may also secure certain future
Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the Holders.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured
Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral

231


-----

_securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured_
_Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.’’_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Senior
Secured Security Documents (the ‘‘Security Interests’’ and each, a ‘‘Security Interest’’) as between (a) the
lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee,
the security agent and the holders of the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture and (e) the
creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future)
permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior
Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by
first-ranking Security Interests. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a ‘‘super
senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain
super senior hedging obligations) have been paid in full. The obligations under the Senior Notes
Guarantees shall rank in right of priority and payment after liabilities owed, among others, under the
Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Senior Secured Notes, and
obligations under the Senior Notes Guarantees will be postponed and subordinated to, among others,
obligations under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

**_Senior Secured Security Documents_**

Under the Senior Secured Security Documents, the Issuer, the Company and the Guarantors will grant
security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Senior Secured
Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties
(including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time). Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Notes,
the Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security
Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
Security Interests, the relevant Senior Secured Security Documents will secure ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations
created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not
been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series
_of Notes—The security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral will be_
_granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to_
_enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide and the Intercreditor Agreement does provide that, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Senior
Secured Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such
contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral,
except through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral (as
applicable).

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Senior
Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been
discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior

232


-----

Secured Notes Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under ‘‘Security—
_Release of Liens.’’_

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Senior Secured Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Senior Secured Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in_
_connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart_
_hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain_
_jurisdictions.’’_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will and the Intercreditor Agreement does restrict the ability of the
Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security
Interests created by the Senior Secured Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by
the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are
described under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.’’ The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to_
future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to
have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior
Secured Security Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Secured
Note, will be deemed (without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Senior Secured Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents securing
such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Senior Secured Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Senior Secured Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the
Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The security interests in the
_Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather_
_than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes_
_Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’_

233


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of
the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and is otherwise not prohibited by the Senior_
Secured Notes Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise
become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as
provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and _‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; or

(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Senior Secured Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may
be permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Senior Secured Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is
required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and
rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release
complies with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without
interest coupons attached, as follows:

- each series of Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Senior Secured Notes’’).
The 144A Global Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in
the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream;
and

- each series of Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes’’
and, together with the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes, the ‘‘Global Senior Secured Notes’’). The
Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in
the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

234


-----

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes (‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through
such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to
_Investors.’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants_
in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) may be
transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’) denominated in the same currency only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

During the 40-day distribution compliance period (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S),
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with any applicable securities law of
any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Note to which
it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum
denominations of A100,000, and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant
Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging
Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to
furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes
payable in connection with such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will
be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries._

235


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**Proceeds Loan**

On August 21, 2017, the Company, as lender, and the Issuer, as borrower, entered into a loan agreement
pursuant to which the Company loaned to the Issuer the gross proceeds from the drawing of the Senior
Unsecured Bridge Facility (the ‘‘Bridge Proceeds Loan’’). The Bridge Proceeds Loan will be refinanced with
a new proceeds loan (the ‘‘Proceeds Loan’’) under a loan agreement to be dated on or about the Issue Date
(the ‘‘Proceeds Loan Agreement’’), pursuant to which the Company, as lender, will loan the proceeds of the
Senior Notes to the Issuer, as borrower.

The Proceeds Loans will be denominated in euros in a principal amount equal to the net proceeds of the
Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan will require the Issuer to make all payments thereunder on a timely basis
in order to ensure that the Company can satisfy its payment obligations under the Senior Notes, including
as to interest, principal, additional amounts, if any, and other required payments due under the Senior
Notes. All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be payable to such account or
accounts with such person or persons as the Company may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds
Loan will be the same maturity date as the maturity date of the Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan will be
an unsecured obligation of the Issuer, and will be contractually subordinated to the obligations of the
Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. The receivables under the Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security, on a first-ranking
basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of Holders and the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging
Obligations, and, on a second-ranking basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders of the Senior
Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ the Senior
Secured Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to September 30, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in
part, at its option, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option, during each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon giving notice as described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to
but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem
Senior Secured Notes, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ with the Net Cash Proceeds
received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 103.500% of the principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
(including any Additional Senior Secured Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture remains
outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Senior Secured Notes held by the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries).

At any time and from time to time on or after September 30, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Senior
Secured Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption
price equal to the percentage of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed set forth
below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding,

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes, including
a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of
Senior Secured Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding
Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer
and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the
Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding
in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder
(excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we
may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘Selection and Notice’’ below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to
purchase Senior Secured Notes as described under ‘‘Change of Control’’ and _‘‘Certain Covenants—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’_

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent
or Registrar will select the Senior Secured Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of
the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed, as certified to the
Paying Agent or Registrar by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and
Clearstream, or if the Senior Secured Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of
selection and the Senior Secured Notes are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and
Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior
Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided,_
_however, that no Senior Secured Note of A100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed_
in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples of A1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the
Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a
related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than 60 days after the date
the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or
purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall
not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the
Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the
relevant Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange
of any change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case
a portion of the original Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Senior Secured Note. In the case of a Global Senior Secured Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof
to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become
due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the
payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them
called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case
of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and
such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such
Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue
Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) _mutatis_
_mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured_
Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

238


-----

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a
written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the
relevant taxing jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)
to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a
Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing
authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including
(without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will
pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or
deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less
than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured
Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place
of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of
such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under such Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any
such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner
or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the

239


-----

Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each
case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured
Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Senior
Secured Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable
payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder
(except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior
Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law
or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that
the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the
Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be
made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior
Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment,
the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment
date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate
as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies

240


-----

(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to
any Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, or
any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a
transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this offering).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any
jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment
under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or
on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs,
unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously
or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase
all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to A100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of A1,000 in
excess thereof; _provided that Senior Secured Notes of_ A100,000 or less in principal amount may only be
redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’)
at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such
Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes
for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than
30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as
described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action
letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in
the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering
Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities
lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of
Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a
Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore,
sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of
Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The

241


-----

Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial
purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under
‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such
restrictions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants
or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable
to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding
Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under
‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition
precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by
the covenants below.

**_Acknowledgment of Control Limitations_**

Prior to the Control Date: (a) to the extent the Issuer undertakes under the Senior Secured Notes
Documents to procure compliance by members of the Target Group with any term of any Senior Secured
Notes Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of the covenant described under the
heading ‘‘—Reports’’) or where any term of any Senior Secured Notes Document is expressed directly or
indirectly to apply to a member of the Target Group, such term, undertaking or requirement will be subject
to all limitations and restrictions on the influence the Issuer may exercise as an indirect shareholder of the
Target (or the access it has to the relevant information in its capacity as shareholder of German Holdco, as
applicable) in accordance with mandatory German corporate law but without any obligation to compensate
or to offer any compensation in accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act (including, but not
limited to, Sections 311 et seq. German Stock Corporation Act) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no breach
of any such term, undertaking or requirement, and no Default or Event of Default, shall occur if having

242


-----

exercised all such influence, the relevant term, undertaking or requirement is nevertheless breached); and
(b) any undertaking given directly by a member of the Target Group shall only apply in respect of such
member of the Target Group and its Subsidiaries and shall be given towards the Trustee and/or the Security
Agent only.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
summarized under the following headings (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’;

- ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’; and

- the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer.’’

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended
Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the ‘‘Reversion
_Date’’) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including in_
connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture), unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain
Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such
time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); _provided,_ _however, that no_
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes
Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions
taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events
would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period.
The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to
as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any
Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Term Loan or the Revolving Credit Facility) will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the
second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created
during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition.
Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments
(as defined below) under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to,
but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension
Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below) shall be_
reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement
entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action_
described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions
_from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have_

243


-----

existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph
under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each
Reversion Date, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such
contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released. All
such further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion
Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade
Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to
have any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if
the Senior Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although
such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; _provided,_ _however, that the Issuer and any of the_
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer may
issue Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of
such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds
thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to
1.00; _provided that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and the amount of Disqualified Stock or_
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the foregoing shall not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be
exceeded.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) (i) A1,700.0 million; plus (ii) A400.0 million; plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of (i) A500.0 million and (y) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA; plus;

(c) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after giving pro forma effect to
such Incurrence the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries do not exceed 5.00 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under
clause (b) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
under this subclause (c) on such date of determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date); plus

(d) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (and assuming for the purpose of such calculation that
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is no less than an amount equal to the greater of the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio as of such date of determination and 5.00:1.00) the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 5.70 to 1.00 (with
any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (b) above on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (d) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date),

_provided that (i) any Indebtedness Incurred and outstanding pursuant to subclauses (a), (b) or_
(c) above shall be deemed to be Senior Secured Indebtedness, whether or not so secured, solely

244


-----

for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for subclause (c)
and (ii) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if
such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing
and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time
(together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and
other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a
refinancing of Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan or the Revolving Credit Facility, such
Indebtedness shall be treated for all purposes as Incurred pursuant to subclause (1)(a)(i) and
(1)(a)(ii), respectively; _provided further that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and_
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to clauses (1)(b), (1)(c) and (1)(d) shall
not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded;

(2) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) Indebtedness of the Target Group outstanding as of the Issue Date or
Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the Issue Date, in either case, in respect of
factoring financings, securitizations, receivables financings or similar arrangements, (b)(i) the Senior
Secured Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior Secured

the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item
of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the
amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof)
in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and
Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (11) and (13) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time
that the Issuer would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(c) or (1)(d) of the second paragraph
of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(c) or
(1)(d) of the second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable;

(3) all Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan whenever Incurred and all Existing Target Debt
Financing outstanding on the Issue Date (excluding an aggregate principal amount of Existing Target
Debt Financing equal to the aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents in the Target Group as
of June 30, 2017 (less an amount of such cash and Cash Equivalents used by the Target Group to

pursuant to clause (a)(1)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Issuer shall not be
permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness Incurred;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to ‘‘cash sweep’’ or
‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this
covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date
of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,

determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of

acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(9) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens,’’ the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including without
limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of
clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings
thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit
facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been

248

borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing
thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
‘‘Reserved Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if
any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the
date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each
case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition, (y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Issuer, be (a) the date
that a definitive agreement for such acquisition or Change of Control is entered into and the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition,
Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; _provided that if the Issuer elects to have_
such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, (i) any such transaction
shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement is entered into and to be
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of
such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such
acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such
baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or
the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any
calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or
making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until
it has been consummated or (b) the date such Indebtedness is Incurred or assumed or such Change of
Control occurs;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with
such refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

-----

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification
of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this _‘‘Limitation on_
_Indebtedness.’’_

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower
Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to
have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
(a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other
costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection
with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (25) above, and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or

of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash

256


-----

Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer
acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any
Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the
Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will
not be deemed to be a ‘‘direct or indirect’’ action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of the Company, limited in all respects to those of its
assets constituting Collateral), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest
therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the ‘‘Initial
_Lien’’), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted_
Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are directly secured equally
and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the
case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture under (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Senior Secured
Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities),
(b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered
into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined_
below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall
be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes
the Successor Issuer;

asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the

mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;

agreement to which the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; _provided that such agreement_

Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders (taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior
Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, together with the Senior Secured Security
Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on
the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Issuer determines at the time of
entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely
affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior

amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of
this paragraph or this clause (15); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with_
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition

of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of
(a) A50.0 million and (b) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by
the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under
any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; _provided_
_further that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or_

259


-----

purchase any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has
extended such offer to the Holders on at least a _pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in_
respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their
Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be
deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered
under this paragraph (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds; or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be
treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with
the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy
such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the
event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such
amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash
of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent
necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial
assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or
(y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result
in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such
Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On the 361st day (or such longer
period permitted by clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset
Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture exceeds A50.0 million in a single transaction, the Issuer will within
10 Business Days be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of Senior Secured
Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders
of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer
price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than)
100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of
A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset
Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each
Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified
purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later
than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations
with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer
with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 360 days (or such longer
period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

260


-----

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in
any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or
lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds
among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro
_rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu_
Indebtedness provided that the Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Secured Notes or
other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset
Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion into Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor)
and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or
other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of (a) A100.0 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the
Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes,
the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes. In
such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Senior Secured Notes would constitute a Default under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction
or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(i) A37.5 million and (ii) 7.5% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) A75.0 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) above if
such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
and (b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, _provided that such Parent_
Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and
the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise
permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any
Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding,
any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments
may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the
Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization
Financing or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables
Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables
Facility;

262


-----

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity which would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of
such Person is also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer
(provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer or such direct or
indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred
Stock) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding and the granting of registration and other customary rights (and the
performance of the related obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to
any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as
applicable; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified,
will continue to satisfy the requirements described in the definition of ‘‘Subordinated Shareholder
_Funding’’;_

(11) (a) any payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly
or indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of annual management, consulting,
monitoring, refinancing, transaction, subsequent transaction exit fees, advisory fees and related costs
and reasonable expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith and any termination fees (including
any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including
an Initial Public Offering) and (b) any customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Entity) for
financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment
banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which are in the case of
each of clauses (a) and (b) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good
faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out of pocket expenses incurred by such Permitted Holder in
connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(13) the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and other
professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions;

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under
the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the Issue Date, and any similar agreement that it
may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date will only be permitted
under this clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not
otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in
good faith by the Issuer;

(16) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by

263


-----

Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates are
on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates;

(17) any (a) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (and
payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in connection therewith) so
long as the Investment is being offered by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary generally to other
non-affiliated third party investors on the same or more favorable terms; (b) payments to Affiliates in
respect of securities of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries contemplated in the foregoing
clause (17)(a) or that were acquired from Persons other than the Issuer and the Restricted

Affiliates of Target Shares from Persons other than the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries

plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement or any stock subscription or
shareholder agreement; and any employment agreements, stock option plans and other compensatory

Issuer or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar
transactions;

(22) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such
Unrestricted Subsidiary is re-designated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under ‘‘—Designation

(27) any Permitted Tax Restructuring.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a Default. If a

264


-----

Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation
and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted
Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would
be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such
date under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Issuer will be in default of
such covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted
under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (5) of
the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause),
calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such
designation. Any such designation by the Issuer or the re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a
Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of such
designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following
reports following the Issue Date:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, and within 120 days
after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31,
2017, annual reports containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end
of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash
flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such
financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iii) unaudited pro
forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other than an Acquisition)
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such
annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report
pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); _provided that such pro forma financial information will be_
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of
the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a
description of all material debt instruments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may
be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017, 90 days) following the
end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with the quarter
ended September 30, 2017, quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i) the
Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending
on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,

265


-----

dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial information
will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer
will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Issuer; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for
so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are
not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or
financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for
any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma consolidated
revenue or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of
the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if
filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications,
exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is,
or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange)
and the Issuer, the Target or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure
standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the

-----

Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports
that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards
(or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as
applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and _provided that such requirements_
require the Issuer, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports,
information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or
more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer
so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including
as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to
such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis;
(iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer on a
combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying
with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained
in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this covenant, the Issuer shall be permitted to use financial
statements of the Target Group with respect to periods commencing prior to the Control Date; provided
that the Issuer also provides separate columns (to the extent applicable) relating to the Issuer as described
in clause (b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, and, when making any calculation required under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, includes the Indebtedness of the Issuer, as applicable.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the
Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the
Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, grant to any Person
other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries
described in the Senior Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, _except that (i) the Issuer, the_
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or
otherwise modify or replace any Senior Secured Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend,
extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Senior Secured Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be
discharged and released in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Senior
Secured Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(iv) the applicable Senior Secured Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any
ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Issuer, the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect
Holders in any material respect; _provided,_ _however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (v) above, the_
Senior Secured Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released or otherwise modified or replaced pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any relevant action with
respect to Senior Secured Security Documents to which the Company is party as a security grantor,
confirming the solvency of the Company), after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a

267


-----

certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, which
confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Senior Secured
Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or
replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the
event that the Issuer, the Company or an applicable Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements
of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other
modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions
from any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit Facility or any Public Debt, in each case
of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on
which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; _provided,_ _however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be_
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for
the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or
shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably
necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth
under ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release.’’ A Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of
such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue
Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as
at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The
Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the
liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on
Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided that (1) such Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in
the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such
intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements
must not conflict.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the
consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured
Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of
the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens,
(7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are secured by first-ranking Liens over
the Collateral. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of
the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that
such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured
Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business
hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Limitation on Activities of the Issuer_**

The Issuer shall not carry on any business or own any material assets other than:

(1) the Incurrence, Guarantee, offering, sale, issuance and servicing, listing, purchase, redemption,
exchange, refinancing or retirement of Indebtedness (and guarantees thereof, including the Senior
Notes Guarantees) permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or performance of
the terms and conditions of such Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the granting of any Liens permitted pursuant to the
covenant described above under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’;

each case to the extent contributed substantially concurrently to a Parent Entity to the extent such
contribution is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) making Investments in the Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes) or
any other Indebtedness to the extent such Investment is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture;

(5) (i) involving the provision of administrative, managerial, legal, treasury (including those related to
overhead costs, paying filing fees and other ordinary course expenses (such as audit fees and Taxes),
treasury services and cash pooling arrangements) and accounting services as to itself and as to its
Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding Issuer to its Subsidiaries as to itself and the
receipt of any amounts related thereto and (ii) the fulfilment of any periodic reporting requirements;

(6) related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its and its Subsidiaries’
corporate existence;

(7) the making or receipt (i) of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Permitted Investment

purpose;

(11) pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions or in the manner specifically contemplated in the

(12) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are ancillary or de minimis in nature.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer or lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any
Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Issuer’’) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, or the United States of America,
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and all obligations of the Issuer
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Issuer as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Issuer or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the applicable Successor
Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or
(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer
and such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Issuer) comply with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (in the
case of a Successor Issuer) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer,
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but in a case of a lease of
all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person; or

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or
a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such transaction;

(B) (1) either (x) the Issuer or another Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security
Documents, as applicable and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

271


-----

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that (A) if the Issuer is not the surviving
entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer
under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents and clauses (1) and
(4) under the heading ‘‘—The Issuer’’ shall apply to such transaction; and (B) to the extent that any
Security Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant Guarantor would not, in
accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity, the
direct holding company of the relevant surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
grant a Security Interest over the shares in the capital of such surviving entity on substantially equivalent
terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation; or (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into
or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of
such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading ‘‘—The Issuer’’ or clause (3)
under this heading ‘‘Guarantors,’’ as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; or (v) any
Permitted Holdco Transaction.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph under the
heading ‘‘—The Issuer’’) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transactions and any Permitted Holdco Transactions will be permitted
without compliance with this section.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note when due and payable, continued for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or, in respect
of the period prior to the availability of audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer
following the Issue Date, as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Target
Group) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date
hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’);
or

272


-----

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross
_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates A50.0 million or more at any time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary
(or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
A50.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies
issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged
and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next
succeeding paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered
by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment
or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(7) any Security Interest under the Senior Secured Security Documents having a fair market value in
excess of A20.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Senior Secured Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) for any reason other
than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release
of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Security
Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security
Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) except as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) is held in any judicial proceeding to
be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor
that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor or
Guarantors, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee.

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not
cure such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and
the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect

273


-----

thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Senior Secured Security
Documents except as provided in such Senior Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect
to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than
90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to
deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the
time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be
cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the
Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability
or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder
may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested
in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be
required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under

274


-----

the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by
taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee
is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if
and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and
what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the
then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the
time at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under
‘‘Optional Redemption’’ or ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;

(4) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due
dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under
‘‘Withholding Taxes’’ that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any
material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss
of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to
withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to
the covenant described under the heading ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the
release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in
the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived

275


-----

with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which
require the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders
to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor under
any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Senior Secured
Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes that
may be issued in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,’’ to add Senior Secured Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to_
add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or
securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided
for under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents
or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ to the
extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ was intended to be a
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security
Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Senior
Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Senior Secured Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities, in any property which is required by the Senior Secured Security Documents or the Senior
Facilities (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided that the granting of such_

276


-----

Security Interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the transfer
and legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including
to facilitate the issuance and administration of Senior Secured Notes; _provided, however, that_
(i) compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior
Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior
Secured Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ relating to_
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or

(12) as provided in ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection
with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a
consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior
Secured Notes Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior Secured Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Senior Secured Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the
Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer’’) and ‘‘Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the
cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provisions described under
‘‘Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of
the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer’’), (4),
(5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under ‘‘Events of
_Default’’ above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ‘‘defeasance
_trust’’) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for_

277


-----

the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in
their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit
and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents will
be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the
Senior Secured Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) as to all Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain
Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have
been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured
Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior
Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or
to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid
all other sums payable under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and
(5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating
that all conditions precedent under the ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been
complied with; _provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact_
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the
Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least three
Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice
of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity
or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.

278


-----

Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view
of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in such Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the
same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed
and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a
conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate
of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any
loss, liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be sent
to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior
Secured Notes are represented by Global Senior Secured Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to
Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices
to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person
by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed
within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall
not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
Euroclear or Clearstream.

279


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be
due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
any Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by
such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein
for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such non-Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in
the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption
price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of America. The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service
of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior

280


-----

Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state
court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the
parties thereunder, and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing
law of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes may be amended with the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior
Secured Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Senior Secured Security
Documents will be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

**Certain Definitions**

‘‘Acquired Indebtedness’’ means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at the time
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (2) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from
such Person, in each case whether or not Incurred by such Person in connection with such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition; or (3) of a Person at the time such Person merges
with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. Acquired
Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been Incurred, with respect to clause (1) of the preceding sentence,
on the date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, with respect to clause (2) of the preceding
sentence, on the date of consummation of such acquisition of assets and, with respect to clause (3) of the
preceding sentence, on the date of the relevant merger, consolidation or other combination.

‘‘Acquisition’’ means any acquisition by the Issuer or German Holdco of Target Shares: (a) pursuant to the
voluntary public tender offer (Freiwilliges _Ubernahmeangebot[¨]_ ) by the Issuer for the Target Shares in

shareholders of the Target for the acquisition by the Issuer of the Target Shares pursuant to Section 10 of
the German Takeover Code; (b) pursuant to any Acquisition Agreement; (c) pursuant to the Domination

Target Shares and made between (i) one or more vendors and (ii) the Issuer, an Initial Investor or any of
their respective Affiliates or Related Funds.

‘‘Additional Assets’’ means:

(1) any property or assets (other than Capital Stock) used or to be used by the Issuer, a Restricted
Subsidiary or otherwise useful in a Similar Business (it being understood that capital expenditures on

(2) the Capital Stock of a Person that is engaged in a Similar Business and becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the acquisition of such Capital Stock by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

Subsidiary.

‘‘Affiliate’’ of any specified Person means any other Person, directly or indirectly, controlling or controlled
by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For the purposes of this
definition, ‘‘control’’ when used with respect to any Person means the power to direct the management and

contract or otherwise; and the terms ‘‘controlling’’ and ‘‘controlled’’ have meanings correlative to the

assumes, Guarantees, redeems, defeases, retires, extinguishes or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness Incurred under any revolving credit facility unless such Indebtedness has been

deemed to be Incurred during such period or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
subsequent to the commencement of the reference period but prior to or simultaneously with the event for
which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the ‘‘Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
_Calculation Date’’), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to_
such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement,
extinguishment or other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period;
_provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to: (i) any Fixed Charges attributable_
to Indebtedness Incurred on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than
Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c), (1)(d) and (5)(b) thereof),
(ii) Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or (iii) Fixed Charges
attributable to any Indebtedness discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date to the
extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described under
the second paragraph under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than Fixed Charges
attributable to Indebtedness discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date using
proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c), (1)(d) and (5)(b) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’); provided further, however,
that at any time prior to the Control Entry Date, in calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
portion of Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred to finance the purchase of Target Shares in
an Acquisition (and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Existing Target Debt Financing and Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of Existing Target Debt Financing) shall be multiplied by a quotient equal to
(x) one, divided by (y) the percentage of the Target Shares held (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer as of
the date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to any increase in ownership of the Target Shares
resulting from the transaction or transactions from which such determination results or which are
contemplated in connection with any Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by the Issuer or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference period and on or
prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a
pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations,
consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in LTM EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the
reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment
pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma
effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer
(and may include cost savings and synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is
being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference
period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a
Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

The following is a description of the A340.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes
due 2025 (the ‘‘Senior Notes’’). The Senior Notes will be issued by Nidda BondCo GmbH (the
‘‘Company’’). You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Notes’’ under the heading ‘‘Certain Definitions’’ below. For purposes of this ‘‘Description of the Senior_
_Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer only to Nidda BondCo GmbH and not to_
any of its Subsidiaries.

The Company will issue the Senior Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about September 29, 2017
(the ‘‘Senior Notes Indenture’’), between, inter alios, the Company, as issuer, Nidda Healthcare Holding AG
(the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Issuer’’), as Guarantor, Nidda Healthcare GmbH (‘‘German Holdco’’ and
together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the ‘‘Initial Guarantors’’), as guarantor, U.S. Bank Trustees
Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’) and as security agent (in such capacity, the ‘‘Security
_Agent’’), and Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is_
not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Notes Indenture will not be
qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the
protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified
indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain
conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Company
together with cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility and
to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering and issuance of the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Notes. The proceeds from the Bridge Facilities, together with proceeds from the Senior
Term Loan, were drawn on August 22, 2017, to finance the acquisition by Bain Capital and Cinven
(together with certain co-investors, including Partners Group AG) of approximately 64% of the Target’s
issued and outstanding common shares in a voluntary public tender offer (Freiwilliges Ubernahmeangebot[¨] )
(the ‘‘Offer’’) by the Issuer for the Target Shares, and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the
Transactions. See ‘‘Summary—The Transactions.’’

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will only be obligations
of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors and will not be guaranteed by the Target or any of its Subsidiaries.
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date, the Target and certain of
its Subsidiaries organized in Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and
Northern Ireland (the ‘‘Post-Control Date Guarantors’’) are expected to enter into one or more
supplemental indentures to become a party to the Senior Notes Indenture and guarantee the Senior Notes
on a senior subordinated basis on the earlier of (a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor
provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and (b) 120 days from the Control Date.

Prior to the Control Date, the Company may not be able to cause the Target Group to comply with the
covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ or other agreements under the Senior Notes
Indenture due to statutory limitations on the influence of shareholders on a publicly listed German
company such as the Target. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Control Date, the Target and
its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Senior Notes
Indenture had those covenants or other agreements been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date,
and any such non-compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under the Senior Notes
Indenture. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Acknowledgment of Control Limitations.’’

The Senior Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which A340.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable
law and the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior
Notes having identical terms and conditions (other than price) as the Senior Notes (any such additional
Senior Notes actually issued, the ‘‘Additional Senior Notes’’); provided that if any series of Additional Senior
Notes is not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Senior Notes, such Additional Senior
Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code from the Senior Notes originally issued.
We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in
the Senior Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the
Incurrence of Liens. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens.’’ Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes,_
and if issued, Additional Senior Notes, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior

321


-----

Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes,’’
references to the ‘‘Senior Notes’’ include the Senior Notes and any Additional Senior Notes that are
actually issued under the Senior Notes Indenture.

The Senior Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflict between the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of
the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain
indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes
Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Notes is only a summary, you should
refer to the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes
Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your rights. Copies
of such documents will be available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Notes_**

The Senior Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Notes (including
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging
obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Company
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

- be (i) guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors on a senior subordinated basis on the Issue Date and
(ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date, on the earlier of
(a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and
(b) 120 days from the Control Date, be guaranteed by such Post-Control Date Guarantors, in each
case, on a senior subordinated basis;

- mature on September 30, 2025; and

- be represented by one or more registered Senior Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Notes (as defined below). See ‘‘Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form.’’_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the First-Priority Senior Notes Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness
of the Company that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes and the Holders will
receive proceeds from the enforcement of Senior Notes Collateral that is not First-Priority Senior Notes

322


-----

Collateral only after any indebtedness with a prior-ranking Lien on such Collateral is repaid in full,
including the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes.

The Company is a holding company incorporated for the purposes of the Transactions, and the Company’s
only material assets are its indirect interests in the Target Group. All of the operations of the Company will
be conducted through its Subsidiaries. Therefore, after the Issue Date, the Company will depend on the
receipt of funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in the form of dividends, other distributions, return on
capital or payments with respect to intercompany obligations) to meet its obligations, including its
obligations under the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment
to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations)
of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, the Initial Guarantors, the Target and all of the Target’s Subsidiaries will be
‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’ for the purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture. However, under the
circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,’’ we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’_
Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Notes
Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Notes.

As of June 30, 2017, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (and assuming that all of the Existing
Target Debt Financing has been repaid by drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and cash and
cash equivalents of the Target Group), the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had
A2,435 million of Indebtedness secured by a prior-ranking Lien on the Senior Notes Collateral (other than
the First-Priority Senior Notes Collateral, which, as of the Issue Date, secures only the Senior Notes),
consisting of A1,700.0 million of drawings under the Senior Term Loans and A735.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes. As of September 22, 2017, the Issuer had drawn A37 million
under the Revolving Credit Facility and A250 million under the Senior Term Loans.

**_The Senior Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors on a senior subordinated
basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Control Date on the earlier of
(a) the date on which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and
(b) 120 days from the Control Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by
the Post-Control Date Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Notes_
Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.

Once granted, the Senior Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a general senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’;

- be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor,
including its Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain hedging
obligations;

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of that_
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Notes Guarantee of that
Guarantor;

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Notes Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor and
its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Notes or the Senior
Notes Guarantees (including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured
Notes and certain hedging obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Senior Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
the relevant Senior Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. In addition, the

323


-----

Senior Notes Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as
described below under ‘‘Senior Notes Guarantees—General.’’ By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect
to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The insolvency laws of Germany and other
_applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of_
_another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests,_
_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.’’ The validity_
and enforceability of the Senior Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Company will issue A340.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.
The Senior Notes will mature on September 30, 2025. The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. While the Senior Notes
may only be traded in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, for
the purpose of the International Central Securities Depositories (‘‘ICSDs’’), the minimum denomination
will be considered to be A1. For the avoidance of doubt, the ICSDs are not required to monitor or enforce
the minimum amount.

The Senior Notes (together with any Additional Senior Notes) will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Senior Notes Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of the Senior Notes Indenture or any other action by the Holders hereunder, except as
otherwise provided in the Senior Notes Indenture.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than
the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

**_Interest on the Senior Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of 5.00% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes will
be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 30 and September 30, commencing on March 30, 2018.
Interest on the Senior Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Notes on the Business
Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Notes
is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not
be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Notes to receive the payment on such Senior
Notes will be subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (‘‘Definitive
_Registered Senior Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents_
maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Senior Notes may be paid, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the
Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Senior Notes.
See ‘‘Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes’’ below.

324


-----

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes_**

The Company will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Notes in London, United Kingdom
(including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK
Branch (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’).

The Company will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’).
The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the
Senior Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate
transfers of the Senior Notes on behalf of the Company. A register of the Senior Notes shall be left at the
registered office of the Company. In case of inconsistency between the register of Senior Notes kept by the
Registrar and the one kept by the Company at its registered office, the register kept by the Company shall
prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Senior Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Notes. However, for so long
as Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
‘‘Exchange’’) and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the
Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**Senior Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a
senior subordinated basis by the Initial Guarantors. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the
occurrence of the Control Date, the Post-Control Date Guarantors will guarantee, jointly and severally, on
a senior subordinated basis (each (including the Guarantees of the Senior Notes by the Initial Guarantors),
a ‘‘Senior Notes Guarantee’’ and together (including the Guarantees of the Senior Notes by the Initial
Guarantors), the ‘‘Senior Notes Guarantees’’) the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Senior Notes,
including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, on the earlier of (a) the date on
which a Post-Control Date Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and (b) 120 days from
the Control Date.

The Target and substantially all of the Subsidiaries of the Target that are organized in Germany, England
and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are expected to become
Post-Control Date Guarantors.

In addition, as described under _‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’ and subject to the_
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that
guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the
Company or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior notes indenture as a Guarantor and
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would
be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules,
corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules,
retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

Each Senior Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under
the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—
_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and_
_the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral’’ and_

325


-----

_‘‘—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_
_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability.’’_

A portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected
to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security
granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles, such as those Subsidiaries
organized in Russia, Serbia and Vietnam. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries,
including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries,
and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and
the Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Notes and each Senior Notes Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the
Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries
of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, Subsidiaries organized in Germany, England and
Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland accounted for 40% of the
consolidated assets, 38% of the consolidated sales and 47% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target
Group. After giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, as of June 30, 2017, the Issuer’s Subsidiaries_
organized in Serbia would have had A53 million in third party financial Indebtedness (excluding finance
leases). Although the Senior Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of
Disqualified Stock of the Company and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject
to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation
on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Notes Indenture. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.’’_

No assurances may be given that the Control Date will occur, and if the Control Date does not occur, the
Post-Control Date Guarantors may not Guarantee the Senior Notes or provide any Security Interests in
respect of their property. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—The Senior Secured Notes
_Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until the Control_
_Date.’’ As of June 30, 2017, prior to giving effect to the Transactions, the Target and its Subsidiaries had_
A1,432 million of third-party Indebtedness outstanding.

**_Senior Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Senior Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

- upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes in
accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and _‘‘Satisfaction and_
_Discharge’’;_

- pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

- as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees’’;_

- upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes; or

326


-----

- as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘Merger and Consolidation.’’

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Notes
Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including the
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date:

- on a first-priority basis, by Security Interests in a pledge of the shares in the Company, a security
assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the Company to German Midco and a
pledge of the material bank accounts of the Company (the ‘‘First-Priority Senior Notes Issue Date
_Collateral’’); and_

- on a second-priority basis, by Security Interests in a pledge of the shares in the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to the Company (the ‘‘Shared Senior Notes Issue Date Collateral’’). The Shared
Senior Notes Issue Date Collateral will also secure the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Facilities and
certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis.

The Security Interests in the Senior Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and
for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Senior Notes Security Documents.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Company_
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Senior Notes Collateral in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including,
subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Senior Notes, as permitted under the Senior
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Senior Notes Security Documents to the Security Agent on
behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Senior Notes
Collateral. Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure
obligations under the Senior Notes, any Senior Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture would
also constitute ‘‘Senior Notes Collateral.’’ All Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are
applicable to Senior Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge_
over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles. For a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles as
they apply to the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes, and which will apply to the Senior Notes,
_mutatis mutandis, see ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—General’’:_

As described above, all of the Shared Senior Notes Issue Date Collateral will also secure on a first-priority
basis the liabilities under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations, the Senior Secured Notes and
may also secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Notes
Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

327


-----

No appraisals of the Senior Notes Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Senior
Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the
_Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes_
_Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.’’_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Senior
Notes Security Documents (the ‘‘Security Interests’’ and each, a ‘‘Security Interest’’) as between (a) the
lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the
trustee, the security agent and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Senior Notes Indenture and
(e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future)
permitted to be secured by such Senior Notes Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior
Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees thereof are
secured equally and ratably by first-ranking Security Interests in the Shared Senior Notes Collateral, and
the Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by second-priority Security Interests in the
Shared Senior Notes Collateral. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

**_Senior Notes Security Documents_**

Under the Senior Notes Security Documents, the Company and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations
under the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes
Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent
for the secured parties. When entering into such Senior Notes Security Documents, the Security Agent will
act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders
from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the counterparties under
certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
Security Interests, the relevant Senior Notes Security Documents will secure ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations
created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under
the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested
under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The
_security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral will be granted to the_
_Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the_
_Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’_

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide and the Intercreditor Agreement does provide that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Senior Notes
Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual
provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes
Collateral securing the Senior Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, who
will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for
the Collateral (as applicable). In addition, prior to the discharge of obligations under the Senior Facilities,
the Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging obligations and other obligations constituting priority
indebtedness under the Intercreditor Agreement, the representatives of the Holders will be subject to a
179-day standstill on the taking of any enforcement action over the Shared Senior Notes Collateral. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Senior Notes Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture, as
applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect
to the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as
provided under ‘‘Security—Release of Liens.’’

328


-----

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Senior Notes Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Senior Notes Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in_
_connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart_
_hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain_
_jurisdictions.’’_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Notes Indenture will and the Intercreditor Agreement does restrict the ability of the Holders
or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created
by the Senior Notes Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.’’ The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future_
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Note, each Holder will be deemed to have,
appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes
Security Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Note, will be deemed
(without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Senior Notes Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Security Documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Senior Notes Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Senior Notes Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the
Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The security interests in the
_Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather_
_than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes_
_Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Senior Notes Collateral will be permitted under any one
or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Senior Notes Collateral to (a) a Person that is not
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation’’), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_

329


-----

‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and is otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that this_
clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable
(including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except
to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise
become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Senior Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of
the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

(3) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in
‘‘Defeasance’’ and _‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’;_

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets,
and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; or

(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Senior Notes Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may
be permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Senior Notes Collateral securing
the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Senior Notes Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security
Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required
by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely
upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described
above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with
the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons attached, as follows:

- each series of Senior Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Senior Notes’’). The 144A Global
Senior Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

- each series of Senior Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Senior Notes’’ and,
together with the 144A Global Senior Notes, the ‘‘Global Senior Notes’’). The Regulation S Global
Senior Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Notes (‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to
_Investors’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants_
in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and

330


-----

subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Notes (the ‘‘144A Book- Entry Interests’’) may be
transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Senior Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’) denominated in the same currency only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Notes Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

During the 40-day distribution compliance period (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S),
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Senior Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Note from which it was transferred
and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly,
from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Senior Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
A100,000, and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Notes
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Senior Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior
Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject
to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described
more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Senior Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of A100,000
and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Senior Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the
transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and
to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

The Company, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,’’ the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior
Notes Indenture.

**Proceeds Loan**

On August 21, 2017, the Company, as lender, and the Issuer, as borrower, entered into a loan agreement
pursuant to which the Company loaned to the Issuer the gross proceeds from the drawing of the Senior
Unsecured Bridge Facility (the ‘‘Bridge Proceeds Loan’’). The Bridge Proceeds Loan will be refinanced with
a new proceeds loan (the ‘‘Proceeds Loan’’) under a loan agreement to be dated on or about the Issue Date
(the ‘‘Proceeds Loan Agreement’’), pursuant to which the Company, as lender, will loan the proceeds of the
Senior Notes to the Issuer, as borrower.

331


-----

The Proceeds Loan will be denominated in euros in a principal amount equal to the net proceeds of the
Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan will require the Issuer to make all payments thereunder on a timely basis
in order to ensure that the Company can satisfy its payment obligations under the Senior Notes including
as to interest, principal, additional amounts, if any, and other required payments due under the Senior
Notes. All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be payable to such account or
accounts with such person or persons as the Company may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds
Loan will be the same maturity date as the maturity date of the Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan will be
an unsecured obligation of the Issuer, and will be contractually subordinated to the obligations of the
Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. The receivables under the Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security, on a first-ranking
basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities
and certain Hedging Obligations, and, on a second-ranking basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of
holders of the Senior Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ the Senior
Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to September 30, 2020, the Company may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part,
at its option, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2020, the Company may, at its option, redeem
Senior Notes, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ with the Net Cash Proceeds received
by the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 105.00% of the principal amount
of the Senior Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed
40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including any Additional Senior
Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including
Additional Senior Notes) issued under the Senior Notes Indenture remains outstanding immediately
thereafter (excluding Senior Notes held by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries).

At any time and from time to time on or after September 30, 2020, the Company may redeem the Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price
equal to the percentage of principal amount of the Senior Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption
date and Additional Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
September 30, of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw such Senior Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making
such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases, all of the Senior Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to
redeem the Senior Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a
price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such

332


-----

tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we
may repurchase the Senior Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘Selection and Notice’’ below.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer
to purchase Senior Notes as described under ‘‘Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’_

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or
Registrar will select the Senior Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent or
Registrar by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream, or if
the Senior Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior Notes
are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of
selection, on a _pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Note in an unauthorized_
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided,_ _however, that no Senior Note of_
A100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Notes in integral
multiples of A1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable
for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Notes to be redeemed at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically
or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the
Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to,
completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state
that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or
such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so
delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

If and for so long as any Senior Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the
Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the
relevant Senior Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Exchange of
any change in the principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior Note
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the
original Senior Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Senior Note. In the case of a Global Senior Secured Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Senior Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion

333


-----

thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Senior Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after
the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases
to accrue on Senior Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Company determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only
if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Company or another Guarantor who
can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be
publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The
foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to
make at least one payment on the Senior Notes and (b) _mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after_
such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it
is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the relevant
taxing jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the
effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change
in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate
and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without
liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a ‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Senior Notes or with respect to any Senior Notes Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing

334


-----

authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note or Senior Notes Guarantee
is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Note or any Senior Notes Guarantee, including (without
limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction
(including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the
amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Note or Senior
Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such_
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place
of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of
such Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such
Senior Note, the Senior Notes Indenture or a Senior Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each
case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Note for
payment (where Senior Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Senior Notes and presentation
is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Note been presented on the last day of such
30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Senior Notes or with respect to any Senior Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law
or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

335


-----

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner held such Senior Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the
Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be
made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Note
or any Senior Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to
the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ there is
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or any Senior Notes
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to
any Senior Notes, any Senior Notes Guarantee, the Senior Notes Indenture, or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Notes
after this offering).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Notes
Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction
in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with
respect to the Senior Notes (or any Senior Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or
any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a
third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Company has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding
Senior Notes as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Company will make an offer to purchase all
of the Senior Notes (equal to A100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess
thereof; provided that Senior Notes of A100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole

336


-----

and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control
Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control
Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by firstclass mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and
offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice,
which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in
the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Company will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters
issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event
a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or
redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering
Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities
lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or the
Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of
Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may
not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering
Event purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of
Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the
Senior Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under
‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such
restrictions in the Senior Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Senior Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may
afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior
Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’
unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption
date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the
applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

337


-----

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer
to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or
modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes
then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of
the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Senior Notes Indenture.
For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants
below.

**_Acknowledgment of Control Limitations_**

Prior to the Control Date: (a) to the extent the Company undertakes under the Senior Notes Documents
to procure compliance by members of the Target Group with any term of any Senior Notes Documents
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of the covenant described under the heading
‘‘—Reports’’) or where any term of any Senior Notes Document is expressed directly or indirectly to apply
to a member of the Target Group, such term, undertaking or requirement will be subject to all limitations
and restrictions on the influence the Company may exercise as an indirect shareholder of the Target (or the
access it has to the relevant information in its capacity as shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
as applicable) in accordance with mandatory German corporate law but without any obligation to
compensate or to offer any compensation in accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act
(including, but not limited to, Sections 311 et seq. German Stock Corporation Act) (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, no breach of any such term, undertaking or requirement, and no Default or Event of Default,
shall occur if having exercised all such influence, the relevant term, undertaking or requirement is
nevertheless breached); and (b) any undertaking given directly by a member of the Target Group shall only
apply in respect of such member of the Target Group and its Subsidiaries and shall be given towards the
Trustee and/or the Security Agent only.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Notes Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture summarized
under the following headings (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’;

- ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’; and

- the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—The Company.’’

338


-----

If at any time the Senior Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended
Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the ‘‘Reversion
_Date’’) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture (including in connection_
with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture), unless and until the Senior Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event
the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Notes maintain an
Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall
be deemed to exist under the Senior Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on,
and none of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such
Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any
actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date,
regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended
Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of
the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any
Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Term Loan or the Revolving Credit Facility) will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the
second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created
during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition.
Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments
(as defined below) under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to,
but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension
Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below) shall be_
reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement
entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action_
described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions
_from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have_
existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph
under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each
Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such
contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such
further obligation to grant Senior Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Senior Notes
achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Company shall notify
the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not
be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Company and any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company
may issue Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the
date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at
least 2.00 to 1.00; provided that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and the amount of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the foregoing shall not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be
exceeded.

339


-----

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the Incurrence by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any
Credit Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) (i) A1,700.0 million; plus (ii) A400.0 million; plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of (i) A500.0 million and (y) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA; plus;

(c) the maximum amount of Indebtedness such that after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence
the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries does
not exceed 5.70 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (b) above on the date of
determination of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation
of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (c) on such date of determination but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent
date),

_provided that (i) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time_
if such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an
amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any
premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a refinancing of Indebtedness under
the Senior Term Loan or the Revolving Credit Facility, such Indebtedness shall be treated for all
purposes as Incurred pursuant to subclause (1)(a)(i) and (1)(a)(ii), respectively; provided further that
the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to
clauses (1)(b) and (1)(c) shall not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) Indebtedness of the Target Group outstanding as of the Issue Date or
Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the Issue Date, in either case, in respect of
factoring financings, securitizations, receivables financings or similar arrangements, (b)(i) the Senior
Notes (other than any Additional Senior Notes), including any Senior Notes Guarantee, and the
Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility, including any Guarantee thereof, (ii) the Senior Secured Bridge
Facility and the Senior Secured Notes (other than any additional Senior Secured Notes), including any
Guarantee thereof, and (iii) any loans pursuant to which proceeds of any Indebtedness of a Parent
Entity that are lent to the Company, to the extent that such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary, and such Guarantees or the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, as the case
may be, as are not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture, (c) any Indebtedness of the Target
Group (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1) and (3) above) outstanding on the
Issue Date and any Guarantees thereof after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the
application of the proceeds therefrom (as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ in this Offering
Memorandum), (d) Refinancing Indebtedness (including with respect to the Senior Notes and any
Guarantee thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) and
clause (5)(b) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and
(e) other Indebtedness Incurred to finance Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets) (‘‘Acquisition Debt’’) or (y) of Persons that are, or
secured by any assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into,
amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Notes Indenture; _provided that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this_
paragraph (5) is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) A75.0 million and

340


-----

(ii) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, plus (b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to
the extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation and without giving effect
to any Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to subclause (5)(a) above on the date of
determination, either: (i) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least A1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph or clause 1(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant,
or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would
not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be higher, and, in each case, than it was immediately prior to such acquisition,
merger, amalgamation or consolidation; _provided that the amount of Acquisition Debt Incurred_
pursuant to clause (b) shall not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes);

(7) Indebtedness (a) represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money

construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or
useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any
Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such
Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7)(a) and then
outstanding, does not exceed the greater of (i) A125.0 million and (ii) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA at the
time of Incurrence, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof (provided that, in each case,
the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental, construction, design, installation or
improvement or is created within 180 days thereafter) or (b) arising out of Sale and Leaseback
Transactions;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, old-age-part-time arrangements,

by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of
financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the Company and the

otherwise contributed to the equity (in each case, other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock, Designated Preferred Stock, any Shareholder Contribution or an Excluded Contribution or
Excluded Amounts (as defined below)) of the Company, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date,
and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; _provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash_
Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall not increase the amount available for making
Restricted Payments to the extent the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in
reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded
for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds
or cash have been applied to make Restricted Payments;

any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of joint ventures in an aggregate amount not to exceed the

Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and

Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded;

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such
item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant,
the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant,
and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part
by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (11) and (13) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time
that the Company would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second paragraph
of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(c) of
the second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable;

(3) all Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan whenever Incurred and all Existing Target Debt
Financing outstanding on the Issue Date (excluding an aggregate principal amount of Existing Target
Debt Financing equal to the aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents in the Target Group as
of June 30, 2017 (less an amount of such cash and Cash Equivalents used by the Target Group to
repay any Existing Target Debt Financing on or prior to the Issue Date), which aggregate principal
amount of Existing Target Debt Financing will be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to
clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) shall be deemed to have been Incurred
pursuant to clause (a)(1)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Company shall not be
permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness Incurred;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to ‘‘cash sweep’’ or
‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this
covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date
of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(6) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

343


-----

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under
a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens,’’ the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Notes Indenture, including without limitation for
purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for
borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined on the date
of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full
amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect
thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of
letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant
irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
‘‘Reserved Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of
clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant
to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Company may revoke such
determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition, (y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Notes Indenture or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at
the option of the Company, be (a) the date that a definitive agreement for such acquisition or Change
of Control is entered into and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change
of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio
(including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at
or prior to the consummation of the relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining
whether such acquisition and any related transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios
shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; provided
that if the Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive
agreement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios
under the Senior Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date
of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in
satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of
consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation of such acquisition, but any calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other
Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such
acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated or (b) the date such
Indebtedness is Incurred or assumed or such Change of Control occurs;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated

344


-----

based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with
such refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification
of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this _‘‘Limitation on_
_Indebtedness.’’_

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower
Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; _provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to_
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to
have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
(a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other
costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection
with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (25) above, and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market
value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash
Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company
acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company,
any Parent Entity or any of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of
the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer
will not be deemed to be a ‘‘direct or indirect’’ action by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or Parentco to, directly
or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of Parentco, limited in all respects to those of its assets
constituting Senior Notes Collateral), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien,
the ‘‘Initial Lien’’), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Senior Notes
Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior
Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture are directly secured equally and
ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, or equal with, or
prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such
Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that
constitutes Senior Notes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes
Indenture under (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set
forth under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and/or under the relevant Senior Notes Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

352


-----

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities),
(b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Secured Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees or the Senior Notes Security
Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition
of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or
any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or
was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; _provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the_
Successor Company (as defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance, restriction or condition:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Senior Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions
restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges,
charges or other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other
agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in
the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; _provided that such agreement_
prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction)
pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such
Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the Holders (taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior
Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, together with the Senior Secured Security
Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on
the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the
Company) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Company determines at the
time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments
on the Senior Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a
default relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

_Liens’’; or_

(15) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of
this paragraph or this clause (15); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with_
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of
the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of
(a) A50.0 million and (b) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

354


-----

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), within 541 days
from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, (A) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior Indebtedness; provided, however, that, in connection
with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related
commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid or purchased, (B) to repay, prepay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no
more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase so long as the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary also makes an offer to the Holders to redeem or purchase any
Senior Notes held by such Holder at a price not less than par, in each case, on a pro rata basis
with any such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that is repaid, prepaid or purchased or (C) to
redeem or purchase Senior Notes; or

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 541 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be
treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with
the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy
such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the
event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such
amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior
Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash
of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent
necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial
assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or
(y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could
result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, the
portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Senior Notes Indenture. On the 542[nd] day (or such longer period
permitted by clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or
the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Senior Notes
Indenture exceeds A50.0 million in a single transaction, the Company will within 10 Business Days be
required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders issued under the Senior Notes
Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and
any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid
or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Notes in an amount
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes (and, in the case of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Notes
Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the

355


-----

Senior Notes, in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.
The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a
copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase
the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Company may satisfy
the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an
Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant
360 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Notes
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition
Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Senior
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of
the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that the
Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an
unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is denominated
in a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in Euro that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion
into Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (a) A100.0 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the
fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Company will comply with
the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the
Senior Notes Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior

356

Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may prohibit or limit, and future credit
agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the
Company from purchasing any Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is
prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the
purchase of the Senior Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from
purchasing the Senior Notes under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(i) A37.5 million and (ii) 7.5% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) A75.0 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) above if
such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Company, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees,
directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that such
Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is
otherwise permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Company,
any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through
any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or

with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management of the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that
could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which would constitute
an Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity
interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a
director of such Person is also a director of the Company or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the
Company (provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Company or
such direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company, as the case may be, on any matter involving such
other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred

the performance of the related obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other transaction with
respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as
applicable; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified,

and reasonable expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith and any termination fees (including

an Initial Public Offering) and (b) any customary payments by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent
Entity) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other

the case of each of clauses (a) and (b) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the

under the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or

agreement that it may enter into thereafter; _provided,_ _however, that the existence of, or the_
performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future
amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the

amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in
any material respect as determined in good faith by the Company;

Company’s Affiliates;

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a
Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market
value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the
time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more clauses of the
definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be
permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Senior
Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under
the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted
under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (5) of
the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause),
calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such
designation. Any such designation by the Company or the re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a
Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of such
designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the Issue Date:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, and within
120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal years thereafter, beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2017, annual reports containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the most recent two fiscal years, including
appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years and the
report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review
of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition,
results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the
Company; (iii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the
Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations (other than an Acquisition) that have occurred since the beginning of the most

360


-----

recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma
information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that
such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of the business, management and shareholders of
the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments;
_provided that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited_
financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017, 90 days) following the
end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the
quarter ended September 30, 2017, quarterly financial statements containing the following
information: (i) the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter
year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior
period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma
financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in
which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company
financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a
discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Senior Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are
not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture) shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial
statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods
presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on
a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s pro forma consolidated
revenue or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which,

361


-----

if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and
other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange)
and the Company, the Target or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure
standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the
Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or
more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure
standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock
Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and _provided that such_
requirements require the Company, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file
annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish
Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, the
Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the
Company so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements
(including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were
references to such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together
with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a
combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not the Company or Subsidiaries
of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated
amounts. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this covenant, the Company shall be permitted to use
financial statements of the Target Group with respect to periods commencing prior to the Control Date;
_provided that the Company also provides separate columns (to the extent applicable) relating to the_
Company as described in clause (b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, and, when making any
calculation required under the Senior Notes Indenture, includes the Indebtedness of the Company, as
applicable.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or Parentco to, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that
the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair
the Security Interest with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or Parentco to, grant
to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Senior Notes Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Senior Notes Collateral, except

362


-----

that (i) the Company, Parentco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate,
supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Senior Notes Security Documents for the purposes
of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Company, Parentco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Senior Notes
Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Senior Notes
Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture, the applicable
Senior Notes Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (iv) the applicable Senior Notes Security Documents may be amended from time to time to
cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Company,
Parentco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not
adversely affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and
(v) above, the Senior Notes Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Company delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency
opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor
confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any
relevant action with respect to Senior Notes Security Documents to which Parentco is party as a security
grantor, confirming the solvency of Parentco), after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a
certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, which
confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Senior Notes
Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or
replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the
event that the Company, Parentco or an applicable Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements
of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other
modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions
from any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit Facility or any Public Debt, in each case
of the Company or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date
on which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Senior Notes Indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Notes Guarantee, which Senior Notes
Guarantee will be subordinated to (in the case such Guarantee of such other Indebtedness constitutes
Senior Indebtedness), pari passu with (in the case such Guarantee of such other Indebtedness constitutes
Pari Passu Indebtedness) or senior to (in the case such Guarantee of such other Indebtedness constitutes
Subordinated Indebtedness), as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior Notes Guarantee is contrary to
the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the
case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the
case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Company, any Senior Notes Guarantee may
contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable

363


-----

preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Senior Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
‘‘Senior Notes Guarantees—Senior Notes Guarantee Release.’’ A Senior Notes Guarantee of a future
Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Company if at the date of such release there is no
Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not
have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture as at the date of such release if such
Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall
each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the
Company to effectuate any release of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Company, Parentco or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on
Senior Notes Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Notes
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided that (1) such Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in
the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Notes Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such
intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements
must not conflict.

The Senior Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the
consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Notes (including
Additional Senior Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Senior Notes Collateral
to secure Additional Senior Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof
or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a
whole) in any material respect. The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent
to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Company
may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion
of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or

-----

immunities under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Notes Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Senior Notes Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be
deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to
the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Limitation on Activities of the Company_**

The Company shall not carry on any business or own any material assets other than:

(12) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are ancillary or de minimis in nature.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Company_**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer or lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, or the United States of
America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly
assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the
Company under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and all obligations of the Company
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes
Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the applicable Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or
(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be
lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Company) comply with the
Senior Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (in
the case of a Successor Company) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor
Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate
as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture, but in a case of a lease of all or
substantially all of its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the
Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person; or

366


-----

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or
a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such transaction;

(B) (1) either (x) the Company or another Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Senior Notes Guarantee and the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Security Documents, as applicable;
and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Company, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Company into any Guarantor; provided that (A) if the Company is not the
surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the
Company under the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Security Documents and clauses (1) and
(4) under the heading ‘‘—The Company’’ shall apply to such transaction; and (B) to the extent that any
Security Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant Guarantor would not, in
accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity, the
direct holding company of the relevant surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
grant a Security Interest over the shares in the capital of such surviving entity on substantially equivalent
terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation; or (iv) the Company or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form
of such entity; _provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading ‘‘—The Company’’ or_
clause (3) under this heading ‘‘Guarantors,’’ as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; or
(v) any Permitted Holdco Transaction.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph under the
heading ‘‘—The Company’’) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transactions and any Permitted Holdco Transactions will be permitted
without compliance with this section.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Senior Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Note when due at
its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Senior Notes Indenture;

367


-----

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries or, in
respect of the period prior to the availability of audited consolidated financial statements for the
Company following the Issue Date, as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Target Group) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created
after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross
_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates A50.0 million or more at any time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating
in excess of A50.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance
policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid,
undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in
the next succeeding paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(7) any Security Interest under the Senior Notes Security Documents having a fair market value in excess
of A20.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with
the terms of the relevant Senior Notes Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture or the release of any such
Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Notes Security Documents or any
such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) except as permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Notes Guarantee of a
Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or
invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor or Guarantors, denies or disaffirms
its obligations under its Senior Notes Guarantee.

368


-----

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes
notify the Company of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Company does not cure
such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may,
and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of
and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Senior Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the
annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Senior
Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Senior Notes Security Documents except as provided in such
Senior Notes Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment
of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Note held by a
non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Senior Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes
Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Notes
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested in writing
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

369


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be
required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any
other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the
Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking
such action.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and
so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Senior Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than
90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior
Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Note
(other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Note or change the time at
which any such Senior Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under ‘‘Optional
_Redemption’’ or ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;_

(4) make any such Senior Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Senior Notes Indenture described under ‘‘Withholding Taxes’’
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Notes in any material respect or amends
the terms of such Senior Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the

370


-----

Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Senior
Notes Collateral (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Senior Notes Indenture; _provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to_
the covenant described under the heading ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the
release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in
the Senior Notes Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Notes Guarantee or the Senior
Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver
or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders
to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a Guarantor
under any Senior Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Senior Notes) that
does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Senior Notes that may
be issued in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,’’ to add Senior Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes, to add security to or_
for the benefit of the Senior Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or
retaking of any Senior Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Senior Notes when
such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Senior Notes Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Security Documents or the
Senior Notes to any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ to the extent that such provision

371


-----

in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the
Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Security Documents or the Senior Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Senior Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Senior Notes Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities, in any property which is required by the Senior Notes Security Documents or the Senior
Facilities (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Senior Notes Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided that the_
granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Senior Notes as permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture, including to facilitate the
issuance and administration of Senior Notes; _provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Senior_
Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely
affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ relating to_
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or

(12) as provided in ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Notes Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Notes
Indenture by any Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Notes will not be
rendered invalid by such tender. The Senior Notes Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the
offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the
Senior Notes Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Notes, registrations of Senior Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment
and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Senior Notes Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company’’) and ‘‘Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment
default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the
Company), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provisions
described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment

372


-----

of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior
Notes. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Notes, payment
of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other
than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—The Company’’), (4), (5) (with respect only to
the Company and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Company), (6), (7) or (8) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in
their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit
and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law since the issuance of the Senior Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Security Documents will be
discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the
Senior Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture) as to all
Senior Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes and certain Senior Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year
or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the
Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Notes
that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;
(3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Senior Notes Indenture;
(4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Notes at maturity or on the redemption date,
as the case may be; and (5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’
section of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in
writing by the Company, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated
Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; _provided, however, that the Holders shall have_
received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Company of such earlier repayment date (which may
be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to
Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest,
present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any
Guarantor under the Senior Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior
Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as
are set forth specifically in such Senior Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Notes Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Senior Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Notes Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes, or may resign at any time by
giving written notice to the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of
interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its
capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then
the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of
the Exchange so require, notices of the Company with respect to the Senior Notes will be sent to the
Exchange.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior
Notes are represented by Global Senior Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders
of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person
by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed
within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall
not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the

374


-----

manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior Notes
will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of,
a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company, any
Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it
from the Company or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
any Senior Note, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein
for the Holder of a Senior Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company’s and the
Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of
the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Note or any Senior
Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such non-Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Senior Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted to
deal in the Senior Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Senior
Notes on the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Notes thereon will be
granted, and settlement of the Senior Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or the Guarantors, including judgments
with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes, may not be collectable within
the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Notes
Indenture and the Senior Notes, the Company and the Guarantors will in the Senior Notes Indenture
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the

375


-----

City, County and State of New York, in the United States of America. The Senior Notes Indenture will
provide that the Company and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit,
action or proceeding with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes
Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, and
the Senior Notes Guarantees thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Senior Notes Indenture and
the Senior Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties
of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The
Senior Notes Security Documents will be governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is
part of the Senior Notes Collateral.

which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the ‘‘Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement,
extinguishment or other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period;

to Indebtedness Incurred on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than
Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c) and (5)(b) thereof),
(ii) Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or (iii) Fixed Charges
attributable to any Indebtedness discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date to the

attributable to Indebtedness discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date using
proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c) and (5)(b) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’); provided further, however, that

Indebtedness in respect of Existing Target Debt Financing) shall be multiplied by a quotient equal to
(x) one, divided by (y) the percentage of the Target Shares held (directly or indirectly) by the Company as
of the date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to any increase in ownership of the Target
Shares resulting from the transaction or transactions from which such determination results or which are
contemplated in connection with any Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by the Company or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference period and
on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be
calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated
fixed charge obligations and the change in LTM EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first
day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition,
merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required
adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving
pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the
Company (and may include cost savings and synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest
and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest
on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by
a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred
to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis
shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period
except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank
offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if
none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

(3) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any

minority shareholders shall constitute Fixed Charges.

(2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness
of the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or in part),

_provided, however, that the term ‘‘Guarantee’’ will not include (x) endorsements for collection or deposit in_
the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice and (y) standard contractual indemnities or
product warranties provided in the ordinary course of business, and provided further that the amount of any
Guarantee shall be deemed to be the lower of (i) an amount equal to the stated or determinable amount of

such guaranteeing Person may be liable pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such
Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an unconditional guarantee of the entire amount of the primary

Person’s maximum reasonably anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such Person in good
faith. The term ‘‘Guarantee’’ used as a verb has a corresponding meaning.

Issue Date. At any time after the Issue Date, the Company may elect to establish that IFRS shall mean
IFRS as in effect on or prior to the date of such election; provided that any such election, once made, shall
be irrevocable. At any time after the Issue Date, the Company may elect to apply GAAP accounting
principles in lieu of IFRS and, upon any such election, references herein to IFRS shall thereafter be
construed to mean GAAP (except as otherwise provided in the Senior Notes Indenture), including as to

elects to report any subsequent financial reports required to be made by the Company. The Company shall
give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee and the Holders.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the impact of IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor standard thereto

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’). Each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the ‘‘144A
Global Notes,’’ the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a
common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interest’’ and, together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry
Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of
the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not
have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form
and will not be considered the registered owners or ‘‘holder’’ of Notes under the Indentures for any
purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
respective nominee), will be considered the holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indentures.
As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indentures.

None of the Issuers, the Trustees, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar under the Indentures nor any
of the Issuers’ respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered Notes
in certificated form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’):

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the relevant Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act
as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the relevant Issuer within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book-Entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an event of default under an Indenture and enforcement action is being
taken in respect thereof under the relevant Indenture.

In such an event, the relevant Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in ‘‘Notice to Investors,’’ unless that legend is
not required by the Indentures or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the

417


-----

holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuers understand that
under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate
basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than A100,000 principal amount at
maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Each of the Issuers will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuers to the
respective Paying Agent. In turn, each Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depository
for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indentures governing the Notes, the Issuers, the Trustees, Paying Agent, Transfer
Agent, and Registrar will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for
Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments
and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustees, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent,
and Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in
‘‘street name.’’

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes, will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised each Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each
of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered
Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective
participants.

**Transfers**

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and
the closing of the offering (the ‘‘40-day Period’’), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be

418


-----

transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor
first delivers to the applicable Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the applicable Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to
_Investors’’ and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other_
jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon
receipt by the applicable Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the applicable
Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in ‘‘Notice to Investors,’’ Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange.’’ Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global
Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other
Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and
become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and ‘‘Description
_of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the_
applicable Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the applicable Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Notice to
_Investors.’’_

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agent,
the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or
procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise
take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest.
The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive
form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition,

419


-----

owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of Exchange. The
Issuers expect that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available
funds.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the Business Day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time
of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES**

**German Taxation**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider
any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the
tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state or
local or church taxes under the tax laws applicable in the federal republic of Germany and each country of
which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**Withholding Tax**

Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident
(i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control
is located in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept
or administered in a custodial account with or presented for an over-the-counter payment to a German
branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, securities trading company or
securities trading bank (each, a ‘‘Disbursing Agent,’’ _auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate to be_
withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total
withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing
Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German
Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt fur Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the
income in the tax return and will then be assessed for church tax. The Issuer of the Notes should under
German law not be required to deduct withholding tax from the proceeds of the investment in the Notes.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal and the
cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Notes
(‘‘Accrued Interest,’’ St¨uckzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective
of any holding period provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of
separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The
same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or interest claims if the Notes have
been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent
since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding
tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any),
unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the
Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within
the European Union, the European Economic Area or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the
Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of
Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal
proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may also apply for an
assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30%
of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on
the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of
the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the
Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The
Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon
the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on

421


-----

investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial
account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_
withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted
if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment
(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the
status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing
payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of
foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of
an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income
and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German
taxation (as outlined below under ‘‘—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents’’)
and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be
levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or
under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains**

**_Tax Residents_**

This subsection ‘‘—Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in
Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident
in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge
and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment
(Privatverm¨ogen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual
allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with
the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby
actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under
‘‘—Withholding Tax’’ above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of
Notes kept in custody abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the
withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the
disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and
capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25%
(plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may
apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an
assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses
(other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the
Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following
assessment periods.

Pursuant to a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance dated January 18, 2016 (as last
amended on June 16, 2016) a bad debt-loss (Forderungsausfall) and a waiver of a receivable
(Forderungsverzicht), to the extent that the waiver does not qualify as a hidden capital contribution, shall
not be treated as a disposal. Accordingly, losses suffered upon such bad debt-loss or waiver are not
tax-deductible if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). The same rules should apply
according to that tax decree, if the Notes expire worthless so that losses may not be tax-deductible at all.

422


-----

Losses suffered from a sale of Notes will only be recognized according to the view of the tax authorities if
the proceeds received in the sale exceed the respective transaction costs.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the
Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not
satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or
corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part
of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as
income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax
return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will
be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to
the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of
a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability
depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an
individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the
personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

**_Non-Tax Residents_**

This subsection ‘‘—Non-Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany
(i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and
control is not located in Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident
in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business
property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained
in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income
from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs property or income from capital investments directly
or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German
tax resident issuer, unless the Notes qualify as global certificates (Sammelurkunden) within the meaning of
Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they are held in
global form. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under ‘‘—Tax Residents’’
applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German
withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter payment by a German
Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject
to certain requirements a holder who is not tax-resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax
exemptions provided by an applicable tax treaty.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident
or deemed to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied
unless (i) the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is
maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii) the obligations under the
Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (unless the Notes qualify as fungible
notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen). We expect the Notes to qualify for this
exception so long as they are held in global form.). Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German
citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany.

**Other Taxes**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Verm¨ogenssteuer) is not levied in
Germany.

423


-----

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to
introduce a financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one
financial intermediary). The timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. Prospective
holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the financial
transaction tax.

**Payment by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions
of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that
such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for exemption from withholding tax.

**Netherlands Taxation**

The information set out below is a general summary of certain material Dutch tax consequences in
connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the Notes. This summary is not a
comprehensive or complete description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant for a
particular holder of Notes and it does not address the tax consequences that may arise in any jurisdiction
other than The Netherlands in connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the Notes. For
Dutch tax purposes, a holder of Notes may include an individual who or an entity that does not have the
legal title to the Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes, or the income thereof, are attributed based
either on such individual or entity holding a beneficial interest in the Notes or based on specific statutory
provisions.

This summary is based on the tax laws of The Netherlands as in effect on the date of this offering
memorandum, and as applied and interpreted in case law of the courts of The Netherlands and in
administrative guidance of the relevant authorities of The Netherlands, in each case as available in printed
form on or before the date of this offering memorandum, without prejudice to any developments or
amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Any reference in this summary to The Netherlands and to Netherlands or Dutch tax law are to the
European part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands and its law, respectively, only.

As this summary is intended as general information only, (prospective) holders of Notes should consult
their own tax advisors as to the Dutch or other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and transfer
of Notes, including, in particular, the application to their particular situations of the tax considerations
discussed below. Holders of Notes may be subject to a special tax treatment under any applicable law and
this summary is not intended to be applicable in respect of all categories of holders of Notes.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantors’’). Any payments to
be made by a Dutch Guarantor under the Notes may be made free of withholding or deduction for or on
the account of any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by The Netherlands or
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

This summary is not intended for any holder of Notes:

(i) for whom the income or capital gains derived from the Notes are attributable to a membership of a
management board or a supervisory board, an employment relationship, a deemed employment
relationship or a management role, the income of which is taxable in The Netherlands;

(ii) who has, or that has, a Substantial Interest or a deemed Substantial Interest (as defined and explained
below) in a Dutch Guarantor;

(iii) that is an entity that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands and that is, in whole or in
part, not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as qualifying pension funds);

424


-----

(iv) that is an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) or a fiscal investment
institution (fiscale beleggingsinstelling) as meant in Articles 6a and 28 of the Dutch Corporate Income
Tax Act 1969, respectively; or

(v) who is, or that is, not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Notes and/or the
income and/or capital gains derived from the Notes.

Generally a holder of Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in a Dutch Guarantor if
he holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily defined term in
Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, shares
representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital
of any class of shares) of a Dutch Guarantor, or rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued,
that represent at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and
outstanding capital of any class of shares) of a Dutch Guarantor, or the ownership of certain profit
participating certificates that relate to 5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of the liquidation
proceeds of a Dutch Guarantor (a ‘‘Substantial Interest’’).

A holder of Notes will also have a Substantial Interest in a Dutch Guarantor if one of certain relatives of
that holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in a Dutch Guarantor. If a holder of Notes does not
have a Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if (part of) a Substantial Interest
has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without recognizing a taxable gain.

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

(i) A holder of Notes who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Individual’’), will generally be subject
to Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from
the Notes at the progressive rates up to 52% (maximum rate for 2017) if: the holder derives profits
from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a
co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder),
to which enterprise the Notes are attributable or deemed to be attributable; or

(ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as
benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden, as defined in the Dutch
Income Tax Act 2001), which include the performance of activities with respect to the Notes, that
exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include
benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang).

If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will
generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, regardless of the actual income or capital
gains derived from the Notes. This deemed return is calculated by multiplying the individual’s yield basis
(rendementsgrondslag) insofar this exceeds a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen), with the progressive
statutory rates of return that are depending on such individual’s yield basis. For 2017, these rates of return
range from 2.87% to 5.39%, but please note that these rates of return are adjusted annually (it has been
indicated by the Dutch Underminister of Finance that the rates of return for 2018 should range from
2.65% to 5.38%). The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying
assets held by the Dutch Resident Individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both
determined on January 1 of the relevant year. The deemed return will be taxed at a rate of 30% (rate for
2017).

_Dutch Resident Entities_

A holder of Notes that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual fund, in each case to
the extent taxable as a corporate entity) and that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands
for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Entity’’), will generally be subject to Dutch corporate
income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes. The
Dutch corporate income tax rate is 20% for the first A200,000 of taxable profits and 25% for the taxable
amount exceeding A200,000 (rates for 2017).

425


-----

_Non-Dutch Residents_

A holder of Notes who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch Resident Entity
(a ‘‘Non-Dutch Resident’’), is generally not subject to Dutch income tax or Dutch corporate income tax
with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Notes, provided that:

(i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as
an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an
entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a
permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in
The Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case may be, the Notes are
attributable or deemed attributable;

(ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or
capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous
activities performed in The Netherlands’ which include the performance of activities in respect of the
Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management and also includes benefits resulting from a
lucrative interest;

(iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in the
profits of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of
securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Notes or payments in
respect of the Notes are attributable; and

(iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual
fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity), such entity is neither entitled to a share
in the profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in
The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the Notes or
payments in respect of the Notes are attributable.

**_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_**

_Dutch Residents_

Generally, gift taxes (schenkbelasting) and inheritance taxes (erfbelasting) may arise in The Netherlands
with respect to a transfer of the Notes by way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of Notes who is
resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the Dutch Gift and Inheritance
Tax Act 1956 at the time of the gift or his/her death.

_Non-Dutch Residents_

No Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will be levied on the transfer of Notes by way of gift by, or on the death
of, a holder who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the
relevant provisions, unless:

(i) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or bequest or as a gift made by or on behalf of a person
who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose
of the relevant provisions;

(ii) such holder dies while being resident or deemed resident in The Netherlands within 180 days after the
date of a gift of the Notes; or

(iii) the gift is made under a condition precedent and such holder is or is deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of the Dutch Gift and Inheritance Tax Act 1956, an individual who is of the Dutch nationality
will be deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if he has been resident in The Netherlands at any time
during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax, an individual will, irrespective of his nationality, be deemed to be resident
in The Netherlands if he has been resident in The Netherlands at any time during the twelve months
preceding the date of the gift. The same twelve-month rule may apply to entities that have transferred their
seat of residence out of The Netherlands. Applicable tax treaties concluded by The Netherlands may
override such deemed residency.

426


-----

**_Value Added Tax_**

No Dutch value added tax (omzetbelasting) is payable by a holder of Notes in respect of payments of
interest and principal under the Notes or on a transfer of Notes (other than value added tax due on fees
payable in respect of additional services not exempt from Dutch value added tax).

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty will be payable in The Netherlands
by a holder of Notes in respect of or in connection with the acquisition, ownership or transfer of the Notes.

**_Residence_**

A holder of Notes will not become or be deemed to become a resident of The Netherlands for tax purposes
solely by reason of the acquisition, ownership or transfer of the Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects. The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for
the discussions below under ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,’’ and does not address the effects of any
U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state,
local or non U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal tax consequences
described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) have been or are expected to
be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court
will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or
disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the
event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount,
timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, certain
financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred
accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency
is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships, S corporations, or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable for
alternative minimum tax, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, persons that actually or constructively
own more than 10% of our voting stock, and persons holding the Notes as part of a ‘‘straddle,’’ ‘‘hedge,’’
‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons
who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their ‘‘issue price’’ (i.e., the first price at which a
substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond
houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents
or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within
the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or
any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) any estate
the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) any trust if a
court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the
trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the

427


-----

activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a
partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the
U.S. federal income tax.

**Additional Payments**

In certain circumstances (see ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control,’’ ‘‘Description of
_the Senior Notes—Change of Control,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption,’’_
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’_
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—
_Withholding Taxes’’) we may be obligated or elect to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on_
the Notes. If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes
may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income
inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed
herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such
additional amounts payable on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of
applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being treated as
contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, we do not intend
to treat the potential payment of additional interest or the potential payment of a premium pursuant to the
optional redemption, redemption for tax reasons or withholding tax provisions as part of the yield to
maturity of the Notes. Our determination that this contingency is remote or incidental is binding on a U.S.
Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it
acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If
the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income
on its Notes in excess of stated interest, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any
income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisor
regarding the tax consequences if the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
discussion below assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Payments of Stated Interest**

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income the U.S.
dollar value of the Euro denominated interest payment on a Note based on the spot rate of exchange on
the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. No foreign
currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than
foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Euros so received, see ‘‘—Foreign
_Amount Tax Compliance,’’ below)._

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on a Note in
Euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

- the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within such
U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or

- at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or
the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one
taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five Business Days of the last day of the
accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments
held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or
thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference between (i) the value of the Euros
received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt,
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount
previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss

428


-----

will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source, and generally will not be
treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Notes.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible
for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that
depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the availability of foreign tax credits. Interest generally will be income from sources outside of
the United States.

**Original Issue Discount**

If the stated principal amount of a series of Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or
greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, [1]⁄4 of 1 percent of the principal amount of
the Notes of such series multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue
date), then the Notes of such series will be considered to be issued with OID for United States federal
income tax purposes. In such a case, the amount of OID on a Note will equal the excess of (i) the sum of
all principal and interest payments provided by the Note over (ii) the issue price (as defined above) of the
Note.

Under the rules governing OID, regardless of a U.S. Holder’s method of accounting, a U.S. Holder will be
required to accrue its _pro rata share of OID on the Notes on a constant yield basis and include such_
accruals in gross income, generally in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is
attributable whether or not such U.S. Holder receives a cash payment of interest on the Notes on the
scheduled interest payment dates.

The amount of OID that a U.S. Holder would be required to include in income is the sum of the ‘‘daily
portions’’ of OID with respect to the Notes for each day during the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder is
the beneficial owner of the Notes. The ‘‘daily portions’’ of interest in respect of the Notes are determined
by allocating to each day in an ‘‘accrual period’’ the ratable portion of interest on the Notes that accrues in
the ‘‘accrual period.’’ The ‘‘accrual period’’ for the Notes may be of any length and may vary in length over
the term of the Notes, provided that each ‘‘accrual period’’ is no longer than one year and that each
scheduled payment of interest or principal occurs on the first or final day of an ‘‘accrual period.’’

For these purposes, the amount of interest on the Notes that accrues in an ‘‘accrual period’’ will be the
product of the ‘‘yield to maturity’’ on the Notes (adjusted to reflect the length of the ‘‘accrual period’’) and
the ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ of the Notes. With respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes,
the ‘‘yield to maturity’’ is the discount rate that, when applicable to all payments under any such Note,
results in a present value equal to such Note’s issue price. The ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ of the Notes at the
beginning of the first ‘‘accrual period’’ will equal its ‘‘issue price’’ and for any ‘‘accrual periods’’ thereafter
generally will be (x) the sum of the ‘‘issue price’’ of the Notes and any OID previously accrued thereon
minus (y) the amount of any payments previously made on the Notes.

The accrual of OID on a Note will be computed in foreign currency, and the amount of accrued OID
determined for any accrual period then will be translated into U.S. dollars, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s
method of accounting and in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in
‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’

Upon receipt of a payment attributable to OID on a Note (whether in connection with a payment on such
Note or the sale, exchange or other disposition of such Note), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar
amount of OID that such holder has previously included in income and the U.S. dollar value of such
payment (determined by translating any foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such
payment is received). Generally, any such exchange gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source and will be
treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. For this purpose,
all payments on a Note generally will be viewed first as the payment of previously accrued OID (to the
extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and thereafter as the
payment of principal.

OID on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered ‘‘passive
category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income
tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits.
The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s

429


-----

particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or
deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, except
as noted below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, a U.S. Holder generally will
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such U.S. Holder
(except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as
described above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note. Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of
purchase, increased by previously accrued OID and decreased by the amount of any payments made on the
Note (other than payments of stated interest). The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the disposition
of a Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received calculated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of disposition.

If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax
accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine
the U.S. dollar values of its adjusted tax bases in the Note and the amount realized on the disposition of a
Note by translating Euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or
the disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be
applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only
with the consent of the IRS.

Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the
Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate
U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain
or loss is attributable to changes in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in which the
U.S. Holder held such Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the difference between
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date (1) the
Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot
rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued OID, which will be treated as discussed above
under ‘‘—Original Issue Discount.’’ The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in
this paragraph will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Note,
and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax
credit limitation purposes.

**Reportable Transactions**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in ‘‘reportable transactions’’ (as
defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its United States federal income tax return a disclosure
statement on IRS Form 8886. The Treasury regulations could be interpreted to cover transactions generally
not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the relevant rules, a
U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as a reportable
transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S. Holders should
consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax reporting obligations, if any, including any requirement
to file IRS Form 8886, with respect to the ownership or disposition of the Notes or any related transaction
such as the disposition of any Euros received in respect of the Notes.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest (including
the accrual of OID) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient
(such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may

430


-----

be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28%,
on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or to
establish an exemption from backup withholding; (2) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer
identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect; (3) there has been a ‘‘notified payee
underreporting’’ described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the U.S. Holder has not certified under
penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a United States
person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding under
the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the backup withholding rules on their particular
circumstances.

**Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’
(as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in the
Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by
certain financial institutions). Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for
purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any,
of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (‘‘FATCA’’)
generally impose a withholding tax of 30% on interest income (including accrued OID) paid on a debt
obligation and, after December 31, 2018, on the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a debt
obligation if such interest income or gross proceeds are treated as passthru payments attributable to
certain U.S. source payments, in each case, to (i) a foreign financial institution (as the beneficial owner or
as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the
United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial
information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain
equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with
United States owners) or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as
an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a
certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any
United States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity, in each case, unless
another exemption applies. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
implications of FATCA on their investment in a Note.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,
FATCA would apply to payments on a series of the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the
Notes of such series for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period.
Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S.
governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the
rules described herein.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE
INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 (the ‘‘Recast Insolvency Regulation’’),
replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended
(the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) and starting from June 26, 2017, the court which shall have jurisdiction
to open the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the
European Union, other than Denmark, (a ‘‘Regulated Member State’’) within the territory of which the
company concerned has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’

In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be its
centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary (Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation). That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
Regulated Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. In addition, that presumption is rebuttable, and the relevant court of a Regulated Member
State should carefully assess whether the centre of main interests is genuinely located in that Regulated
Member State. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut the presumption where the company’s central
administration is located in a Regulated Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third
parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its
interests is located in that other Regulated Member State (Recital (30) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation). When determining whether the centre of main interests is ascertainable by third parties,
special consideration should be given to the creditors and to their perception as to where a company
conducts the administration of its interests. This may require, in the event of a shift of centre of main
interests, informing creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in
due course, for example by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence, or
by making the new location public through other appropriate means (Recital (28) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation).

If the centre of main interests of the debtor is located in the Regulated Member State in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall be opened
in that Regulated Member State and accordingly the courts of that Regulated Member State shall have
jurisdiction to open any of the insolvency proceedings applicable in that Regulated Member State (see
Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation).

Notwithstanding the opening of a main insolvency proceeding in a Regulated Member State, ‘‘secondary
insolvency proceedings’’ may be opened in another Regulated Member State if such debtor possesses an
‘‘establishment’’ (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in that Member State.
The effects of these proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor in the territory of that
Regulated Member State.

If the debtor possesses an ‘‘establishment’’ in a Regulated Member State, ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ under
Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation may be opened prior to the opening of main insolvency
proceedings, where (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down
by the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the center of the debtor’s main
interests is situated or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor
whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the
territory of the Regulated Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a
public authority which, under the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the
establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main
insolvency proceedings are opened, the territorial insolvency proceedings shall become secondary
insolvency proceedings.

In the event that the Issuers or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability
of the obligations of the Issuers and the collateral provided by the Issuers or any other company. The
insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are
organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no

432


-----

assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation
to one another.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuers and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices
in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of a
Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in Germany
(any such Guarantor, a ‘‘German Notes Guarantor’’) at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be
initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain
circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law
over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the centre of main
interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over German Guarantors may be
opened in other jurisdictions. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests—European Union.’’_

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the
United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for
secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising and other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit),
meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period
longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on
their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly
likely based on a two-year forecast horizon (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich). If a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European
law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) _or any other company not having an_
individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or
over-indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such company and, in certain
circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without delay but not later than three
weeks after such illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness incurred or (as the case may be) was established.
Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as
sanctions under criminal law. A debtor is not considered over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value
of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business can survive as a
going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency
proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), if there is the imminent
risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas imminent illiquidity
does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and/or is over-indebted
(Uberschuldung[¨] ) it may also file for preliminary ‘‘debtor in possession’’ moratorium proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a
successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee
(vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable
assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement
actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which
ideally shall be implemented in formal ‘‘debtor in possession’’ proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal
insolvency proceedings have been opened.

433


-----

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these
protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the
debtor’s business.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the
court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary
insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary
administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include
safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be
sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even
the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary
insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by
unsecured creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a ‘‘preliminary creditors’
committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

(a) a balance sheet total in excess of A6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over-indebted);

(b) revenues of at least A12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

(c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the
selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for ‘‘debtor in possession’’ proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorl¨aufiger)_ _Sachwalter). The court opens_
formal insolvency proceedings (Er¨offnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met,
including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the
debtor), illiquidity and/or over-indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the
insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the
insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the
costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will
only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon
opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the
debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) will only
be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of
votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to
become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder,
i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case
of debtor- in-possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other
liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of
the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor.

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See
‘‘—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer’’).

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against
any Guarantor’s subject to the German insolvency regime would include the following:

(a) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer
and dispose of the Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the (preliminary) insolvency
administrator ((vorl¨aufiger) Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the
Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation
of law;

(c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the
debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null
and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings;

(d) claims against any Guarantors may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does
not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the
claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the
insolvency administrator.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the
occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte
_oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_
whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights (Wahlrecht des
_Insolvenzverwalters) applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not_
governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to
assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their
claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency
administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought
against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings
have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed
and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency
proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the
insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a _pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent_
sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security
interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have
only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured
creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization.
Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to
enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency
administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are
subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims
that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in
legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement
process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of
any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of
and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds

435


-----

(Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges for
(i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor
holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining
amounts (‘‘excess proceeds’’) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after
deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the insolvency
administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the creditors’ committee) and after
satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured
creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral
securing the Notes). If a German Notes Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency
proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security
may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential
treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The
excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes by the German Notes Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may
take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to
unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which
requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a
debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a
debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap. Under certain conditions, the
debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon
request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable
assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement
actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s
business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Given
the relatively recent enactment of these amendments, these provisions may not have been tested in
practice and no judicial precedents are available in such respect.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency
law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German
insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-`a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. As a
general principle, the claims arising from a guarantee may be enforced against a German Notes Guarantor
outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuers. Any insolvency proceeding over the
assets of the Issuers would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the
entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Notes
Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency. On April 13, 2017, the German legislator passed an act to
facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bew¨altigung von
_Konzerninsolvenzen), which will come into force on April 21, 2018. This act is mainly intended to facilitate_
the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. This act does
not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a
consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code
in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume
jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated;
(iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordinator’’ (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability
to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including,
but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of
repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and

436


-----

undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being
considered in a ‘‘shareholder-like position’’ (gesellschafter¨ahnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency
proceeding over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor, the claims arising from a Notes Guarantee
would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated
insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German
Notes Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing
these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency
cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only
after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured
creditors.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such
time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

_Limitations on Enforcement_

Some of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschr¨ankter_ _Haftung—‘‘GmbH’’)_ and/or a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft). Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these
companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend
_die Gesellschaften mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, ‘‘GmbHG’’), the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz)_
and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future German Notes Guarantor in the form of
a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG) or
Aktiengesellschaft.

GmbH Limitation Language

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net
assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its
stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by
a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be
considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to
issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures,
credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to
subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner
incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the
guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement
does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner,
such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are
already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced.
Accordingly, the Notes Guarantee, the Indentures and the Security Documents provided by the German
Notes Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Notes
Guarantees, the Indentures and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral is limited in the manner described.
This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German
Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes
Documents, in particular in the Indentures, will substantially be in the form as follows:

‘‘(a) The restrictions in this Clause shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and other
payment obligations under this Clause or any other provision in this Indenture and/or any
other documents in connection therewith granted by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of
Germany as a limited liability company (GmbH) (a ‘‘German GmbH Guarantor’’) to secure liabilities
of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a Subsidiary of such
shareholder (but excluding any direct or indirect Subsidiary of such Guarantor) (cross-stream) (a
‘‘Guarantee’’).

437


-----

(b) The restrictions in this Clause shall not apply:

(i) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent the German GmbH
Guarantor secures any indebtedness under this Indenture in respect of (i) loans to the extent
such loans are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant
German GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are
issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the
German GmbH Guarantor’s Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or
otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the
enforcement of the Guarantee; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (b) shall
have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip);

(ii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), if, at the time of enforcement of the
Guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) as per Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz,_
_AktG) (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit_
transfer agreements) exists between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated
company, and:

(A) that German GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the relevant Obligor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant Guarantee, that Guarantor; or

(B) the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by
the relevant Guarantee are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company
and such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen),

in each case to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling
agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) leads to the inapplicability of
section 30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liabilities Company Act (GmbHG);

(iii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent any payment under the
Guarantee demanded by the Trustee from the relevant German GmbH Guarantor is covered
(gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs- oder R¨uckgew¨ahranspruch) of the German GmbH Guarantor against the affiliate_
whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee; or

(iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the Guarantee has been
enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this Clause because the
Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination has not (or not in a timely
manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the Auditor’s
Determination has then been delivered within four months from its due date in accordance with
paragraph (e) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the German GmbH Guarantor repay any
amount received from the German GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s
Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination
had been delivered in a timely manner.

(c) The parties to this Indenture agree that if and to the extent payment under the Guarantee would
cause (i) the amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets, as calculated and defined pursuant
to paragraph (h) below, to fall below the amount required to maintain its registered share capital
(Stammkapital) or increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share
capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating §§ 30, 31 GmbHG (such event, a ‘‘Capital Impairment’’),
or (ii) a German GmbH Guarantor to be deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities
towards its creditors and thereby violating Section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liabilities
Company Act (GmbHG) (such event, a ‘‘Liquidity Impairment’’) then the Trustee shall not enforce
and the German GmbH Guarantor shall, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, have a defense
(Einrede) against any claim under the Guarantee if and to the extent such Capital Impairment or
Liquidity Impairment would occur.

(d) If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in (the ‘‘Management
Notification’’) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the making of a demand against that
German GmbH Guarantor under the Guarantee:

(i) to what extent such Guarantee is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and

438


-----

(ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result of an
enforcement of the Guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its Net Assets or to
which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet or
liquidity statement),

then the restrictions set out in this Clause shall cease to apply until a Management
Notification has been provided.

(e) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of
its receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty-five
(45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of
international standard and reputation (the ‘‘Auditor’s Determination’’) appointed by the
German GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount
in which the payment under the Guarantee would cause a Capital Impairment or Liquidity
Impairment, subject to the terms set out under this Clause . Save for manifest errors, the
Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(f) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any
or only partial payment under the Guarantee, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial
conditions of the German GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has
substantially improved, the Trustee may (acting reasonably), at the German GmbH Guarantor’s cost
and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the German GmbH
Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s
Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such Auditors
to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment
has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the German GmbH
Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to
the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s Determination.
The Trustee may only demand payment under the Guarantee to the extent the Auditors determine
that the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment have been cured.

(g) The net assets (Reinverm¨ogen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the ‘‘Net Assets’’) shall be
calculated in accordance with § 42 GmbHG, §§ 242, 264 of the HGB and the generally accepted
accounting principles applicable from time to time in Germany (Grunds¨atze ordnungsgem¨aßer
_Buchf¨uhrung) and for the purposes of calculating the Net Assets, the following balance sheet items_
shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH
Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became a party to
this Agreement and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerh¨ohung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall
be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant
German GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under this Indenture and has been carried
out without the prior written consent of the Agent;

(ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 253 subsection 6 of the HGB shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 268 subsection 8 of the HGB shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 272 subsection 5 of the HGB shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Assets; and

(v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly
negligent violation of this Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(h) Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this Clause
that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall (A) realize, to the extent lawful
and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the
balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the
assets and are not necessary (betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business,
and (B) use best efforts to realize, to the extent legally permitted in a situation where it does not have
sufficient liquidity to fulfil its liabilities to its creditors, any and all of its assets if the relevant asset is
not necessary for the German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

439


-----

(i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this
Indenture to the Trustee.

(j) Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming
in court that the provision of this Guarantee and/or making payments under this Guarantee by the
relevant German GmbH Guarantor does or does not fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31 and/or 64
sentence 3 of the GmbHG and/or § 826 German Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch).

(k) In addition to the restrictions set out in this Clause, if a German GmbH Guarantor
demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any
upstream or cross-stream guarantee or security interest against such German GmbH Guarantor would
result in personal liability of its managing director(s) (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) for a reimbursement of
payments made under the Guarantee (including, without limitation, pursuant to § 826 of the German
Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch)), the German GmbH Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede)
against the Guarantee to the extent required in order not to incur such liability.

(l) The provisions of this Clause shall apply to a limited partnership with a limited liability
company as its general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) _mutatis mutandis and all references to Capital_
Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets shall be construed as a reference to the Capital
Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets of the general partner (Komplement¨ar) of the
German GmbH Guarantor.

(m) For the purposes of this Clause, a reference to a ‘‘German GmbH Guarantor’’ includes any
limited liability company incorporated (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its
general partner) in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as that term is
used in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings is in
Germany.

(n) The parties are aware that—due to recent developments—it is currently discussed which point in time
is relevant when determining whether a managing director or other representative of a German
guarantor has complied with the capital maintenance provisions. In respect of a valuation of the Net
Assets which are available for enforcement of a guarantee without causing any liability for
management, the Parties consider the point in time of the enforcement of the Guarantee as being
relevant which is therefore the relevant point in time for calculating the available Net Assets purposes
of this Clause. Should new legislation or jurisprudence of a higher regional court (Oberlandesgericht)
or the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (including, without limitation, based on
proceedings initiated by the relevant Guarantor and/or its managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer)) be
published and/or come into force after the date of this Indenture and should such law or court ruling
lead to a different legal and/or factual assessment:

(i) of the granting of the guarantee by the relevant Guarantor, the Trustee shall, upon the relevant
Guarantor’s managing directors’ (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) request, enter into
good faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent necessary to
avoid the managing directors’ (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) personal liability
resulting from the granting of the guarantee (taking into account the initial intention of the
limitations set out in this Clause and, including but not limited to, amending reference
points for the assessment whether or not a violation of sections 30, 31 GmbHG has occurred); or

(ii) of the enforcement of the guarantee so that the limitations in this Clause are, are not, or
only partially be, required to protect the managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other
representatives) of the Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability from the enforcement of
the guarantee, the Guarantors shall, upon the Trustee’s request, enter into good faith
negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent such provisions are, or
are not required anymore to protect the managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other
representative’s) of the Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability arising from the
enforcement of the guarantee.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Clause and any rights and/or
obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.’’

_AG Limitation Language_

As a general rule, section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) prohibits the disbursement of
the deposits to the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenr¨uckgew¨ahr). In addition, pursuant to section 71 (a)
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) the relevant German public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft) may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the
acquisition of the stock in such German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Any
agreement in such respect is void.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating section 57 German
Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and/or section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), it
is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German public limited
liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees or the security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the
German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of section 57
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and/or section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz). Accordingly, the Notes Guarantee, the Indentures and the Security Documents relating to
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by the German Notes Guarantors will contain such
limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees, the Indentures and the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral is limited in the manner described below. This could lead to a situation in which
the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced
at all. In particular, the Target, which, together with the other Post-Control Date Guarantors, is expected
to provide a Notes Guarantee and certain Collateral under the Senior Secured Notes after the Control
Date under certain conditions set forth in the relevant Indentures, is incorporated in Germany in the form
of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Since all Post-Control Date Guarantors
are direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Target, all limitations applicable to a German public limited
liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) (whether by virtue of law or contractual limitation language) will
consequently also apply to such subsidiaries even if incorporated in a legal form other than a German
public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of
_Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral.’’_

The limitation language for any public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) to be incorporated into
the relevant Notes Documents, in particular in the security documents, will substantially be in the form as
follows:

(a) ‘‘Any guarantee or any liability, indemnity or other payment obligation (the ‘‘Guarantee’’) of a
Guarantor which is a public limited liability company under German law (Aktiengesellschaft) (an ‘‘AG
Guarantor’’) or by any Guarantor that is a Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall not be enforced to
the extent such Guarantee secures or relates to liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect
shareholders of that AG Guarantor or Subsidiaries of such shareholders (such Subsidiaries not to
include the AG Guarantor and the Subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) if the relevant AG Guarantor
is not party to a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) as the dominated party with a direct shareholder as the dominating party._

(b) If a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- _und/oder_
_Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) is in force between the relevant AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder_
(with the direct shareholder as dominating party) any Guarantee granted by such AG Guarantor or by
any Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor under this Agreement shall be enforceable except that it shall
not be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent (i) the payment by the AG Guarantor or by a
Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of those Guarantee Obligations which secure liabilities
which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of that AG Guarantor or Subsidiaries of such
shareholders (such Subsidiaries not to include the AG Guarantor and the Subsidiaries which are also
Subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) will, or must be expected to, result in an annual loss to that AG
Guarantor and (ii) such annual loss would not be, or cannot be expected to be, compensated for by a
compensation claim under the relevant domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement
(Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) that can be accounted for in the balance sheet of
that AG Guarantor at full value (vollwertig), unless the mere existence of a domination and/or profit

441


-----

and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) between the relevant
AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder (with the direct shareholder as dominating party) leads to the
inapplicability of Section 57 sub-section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in which case
sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) shall not be applicable and which shall be deemed to be the case if so
explicitly confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter dictum) by the Federal Court of
Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in a third party case.

(c) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor shall not be limited to
the extent any payment under the Guarantee demanded by a Finance Party from the relevant AG
Guarantor is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim
(vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder R¨uckgew¨ahranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the affiliate
whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee and would therefore not lead to a violation
of Section 57 sub-section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), unless this exception would
lead to a violation of Section 71 a of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee granted by an AG
Guarantor or of any Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are
owed by that AG Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and
(b) above.

(e) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor or of any Subsidiary of
that AG Guarantor shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and (b) above in an amount equal to the
amount drawn under the Facilities (the Drawn Amount) if and to the extent such Drawn Amount is
applied for the repayment, prepayment or other refinancing of any Financial Indebtedness of such AG
Guarantor or Subsidiary of such AG Guarantor, provided that exception does not lead to a violation
of section 57 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

(f) The restrictions set out in paragraph (b) above do not affect the rights of the Finance Parties to claim
any outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent paragraph (b) above would
allow such claim at that later point.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall no further apply
from the date the AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as a public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft) unless such Guarantor is a Subsidiary of another AG Guarantor in which case
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall apply in a way that the Guarantor shall be treated as a Subsidiary
of that other AG Guarantor in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In such event, the limits
set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply to the Guarantee granted by that Guarantor in
respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.

Any guarantee, indemnity or upstream benefit granted under any Finance Document by the Target or
any of its Subsidiaries in respect of liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect
shareholder(s) (upstream) or a Subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Target) (cross-stream) will in any case take effect not earlier than immediately after
the occurrence of the Control Date.

(h) German terms in this Clause (including any reference to German statutory provisions) shall be
construed in accordance with German law.’’

_General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect
to Sections 30, 31 and 64 sentence 3 GmbH and Sections 57, 71a and 92 para. 2 sentence 3 AktG), are
subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access
of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a GmbH or
a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Notes Guarantors to make
payments on the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees, the
Indentures and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral (i.e. the share pledges and any other
security interest) provided by the German Notes Guarantors.

442


-----

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding ‘‘destructive interference’’ (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in
which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations)
may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the
German Notes Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement
process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of
contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the
debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners.
It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Notes
Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Notes Guarantors (including in the legal form of an AG).

Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the
stated share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of
such guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case
if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the
other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such_
intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating
that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or
had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured
claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not
be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured
claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted
to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a
‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and
independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes. The
pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned)
secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly.
The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such
parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or
mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to
enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior
_Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes.’’_

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale
of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain
waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security
interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having
granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts
have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking)
in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right
to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other
creditors).

_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that
debtor-in-possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten)
transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were
effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. The
administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend

443


-----

to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of
insolvency proceedings. On March 29, 2017, the German legislator passed an act for the improvement of
legal certainty concerning clawback pursuant to the German Insolvency Code and the German Avoidance
Act (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und nach dem
_Anfechtungsgesetz), which entered into force on April 5, 2017 (subject to certain transitional provisions)._
The amendments to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the German Avoidance Act
(Anfechtungsgesetz) concern, inter alia, the provisions on avoidance for intentionally disadvantaging thirdparty creditors (Vorsatzanfechtung), cash transactions (Bargesch¨afte) and interest accruing on avoidance
claims.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to us, which would be based on and governed by the
insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of
collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential
challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of avoidance as set
forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes
or any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to
recover any amounts under the Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under
the Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to
be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of Notes would only have a general unsecured claim
under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases, as recently amended
by the act to improve legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under the German Insolvency Code
and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach
_der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz) which became effective on April 5, 2017:_

(a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the
last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such
illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the
debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such
illiquidity or filing);

(b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not
entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was
not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the
filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act
was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was
illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was
taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect);

(c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at
the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such
time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the
counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the
transaction;

(d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings;

444


-----

(e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice
the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such
knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that
the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or
enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled,
in which case such knowledge (solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was
illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting
an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which
such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings or at a time after the filing;

(f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an a related party
(nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged
unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities,
the term ‘related party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or
supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share
capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information
about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members
of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

(g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a
shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision
of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of
satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for
shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest
and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a
creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity
for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and

(h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to
a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder B¨urge) (in which case the
shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

We note that the pledge over the shares in the Target, which is included in the Senior Secured Notes Issue
Date Collateral, was granted by German Holdco. German Holdco was only incorporated after the date of
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement to which it subsequently acceded as guarantor.

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as
they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was
detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed
to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s
imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted
an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee)
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was
entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words ‘‘imminent illiquidity’’
(drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by ‘‘actual illiquidity’’
(eingetretene Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement
(Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to,
the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the
illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a ‘‘related party,’’ there is a general

445


-----

statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ Any amounts obtained from transactions that
have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an
enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a
levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the
payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz).
The conditions for avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the abovedescribed rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date
when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the
intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the
legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or
security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future due to the current
EU Commission’s proposal as of November 22 2016 for a directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of
restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and amending Directive 2012/30/EU which may, _inter_
_alia, stipulate that claims of the relevant creditors may be modified by majority vote and against the voting_
of a single creditor even outside formal insolvency proceedings.

**United Kingdom**

Each of the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of England and Wales is subject to an English law
debenture. Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Guarantors would likely be based on
English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation on Insolvency
Proceedings, where a company incorporated under English law has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in a
member state of the European Union other than England and Wales, then the main insolvency
proceedings for that company may be opened in the member state in which its centre of main interests is
located and be subject to the laws of that member state. The point at which this issue falls to be determined
is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model
Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., non-English) court
may have jurisdiction where any English company has its centre of main interests in such foreign
jurisdiction, or where it has an ‘‘establishment’’ (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction,
where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). To the
extent that the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation of the United
Kingdom under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will
prevail.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar and, in the event that Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales experience
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or
the holder of a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (discussed below) making an application for administration out
of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the
case of a liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into
administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably
likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se, but relies on the concept of a company being
‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86, a

446


-----

company is deemed unable to pay its debts in certain circumstances, including, among others, the
following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a
statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for
three weeks thereafter failed to pay, secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of
the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

The obligations under the Notes are secured by English law governed security interests over the Collateral
and therefore English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of security
interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the security interests over the Collateral that are governed by English law. The application
of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the Collateral
securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an
English company.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (a) an administrator
appointed to the company which granted the floating charge can dispose of floating charge assets for cash
or collect receivables charged by way of floating charge and use the proceeds and/or cash subject to a
floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the
charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder;
(b) a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may rank
prior to the floating charge over the relevant assets providing that the floating charge has not crystallized at
the time the fixed charge is granted; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s
remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the
assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to
certain restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating
charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating
charge security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) floating charge
security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme
contributions and salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to
employees) and, where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims
of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced amount of the proceeds.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security
interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have
the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the
proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the description given to the charges in the
relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the
secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in
question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**Spain**

Although the Notes will not be guaranteed by any guarantors incorporated in Spain due to applicable
financial assistance rules, certain of STADA’s subsidiaries in Spain guarantee the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities up to the amount drawn under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that is applied toward the
repayment of the Existing Debt (each, a ‘‘Spanish Guarantor’’). Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
any proceeds from the Spanish guarantees received by the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement will have to be shared with the lenders in respect of certain hedging obligations and
holders of the Senior Secured Notes on a pari passu basis and, to the extent that such obligations have been
discharged in full, the holders of the Senior Notes on a subordinated basis. As a result, the description of
Spanish law set forth below discusses the limitations applicable to the guarantees provided by the Spanish
Guarantors of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, because such guarantees may indirectly benefit the
holders of the Notes.

447

**_Spanish Insolvency Law_**

The Spanish Insolvency Act 22/2003, of July 9, as amended (the ‘‘Spanish Insolvency Act’’) regulates
insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-of- court liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish corporate law,
is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities). The Spanish full-blown
insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as ‘‘concurso de acreedores,’’ applies to all persons
or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Act). These
proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the
creditors and the debtor (the ‘‘Company Voluntary Agreement’’ or the ‘‘Composition Agreement’’) or to
the liquidation of the debtor’s assets.

_Insolvency Filing_

A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the bankruptcy petition upon inability
to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for
such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due.
Creditors do also have standing to petition bankruptcy when the debtor is unable to regularly pay its debts
as they come due.

Bankruptcy is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor requests the
bankruptcy, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a petition for
bankruptcy within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of
insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes
aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a
petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for bankruptcy within the
time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted
by a bankruptcy authority once the bankruptcy is declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) the
debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of action (including, _inter alia, the possibility of_
submitting a pre-arranged settlement proposal); and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired
claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should the debtor be liquidated and bankruptcy be
classified as ‘‘guilty.’’

Bankruptcy is considered mandatory or involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party. Under
article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if it can
prove that the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed. A
creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the court: (i) a generalized default on
payments by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets;
(iii) a misplacement, ‘‘fire sale,’’ hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (iv) a
generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable
statutory period (i.e. three months).

_Pre-Insolvency Filing_

Spanish law currently contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding known as article 5.bis
pre-bankruptcy proceeding, which is an insolvency proceeding under both Spanish and European
regulation. It protects the debtor, for a four-months period, from petitions for involuntary cases.

The general duty to file for bankruptcy within the referred two-months period does not apply if the debtor
notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support to reach a
pre-arranged composition agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado) or an out-of-court workout (a
refinancing agreement) set out in Section 71.bis.1 or in the Fourth Additional Disposition of the Spanish
Insolvency Act (the so-called 5 bis communication). Effectively, by means of the 5 bis communication, on
the top of those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-months period as from the date when the
debtor gives such notice, to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an
anticipated composition agreement and one further month to file for bankruptcy, if after the above
mentioned period of three months has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of
insolvency persists. During such period of time, creditors’ petitions for involuntary cases will not be
accepted.

Additionally, during the four-month protection period provided for by _5 bis notice (or three months_
according to certain case law), enforcement will be prevented: (i) by creditors, other than public, over
assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business; and (ii) by financial creditors

448


-----

referred to in the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act over any asset, provided financial
creditors holding at least 51% of the financial indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have
expressed their will to commence negotiations in order to reach a refinancing agreement and have
committed not to initiate or continue enforcement proceedings against the debtor.

Further, any outstanding enforcement action which falls into the above categories that was commenced
before the filing for a pre-insolvency moratorium will be suspended.

**_Enforcement and Termination in a Pre-Insolvency Scenario_**

The obligations under the Senior Notes and the Guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in
accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia,
the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the
discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish Law on
Civil Procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamento Civil) regarding remedies and enforcement
measures available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act and other principles of
law of general application. In this regard:

- Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Section 1,152 of the Spanish
Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cl´ausula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will
substitute damages (indemnizaci´on de da˜nos) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an
event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an
equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty
(liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be
disproportionate according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability in
Spain of punitive damages.

- Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in
Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.

- Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the
discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and
enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting
parties.

- Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on
the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or
complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment
obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such
termination.

- Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said
acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in
circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided
shall apply.

**_Effects of Bankruptcy Declaration_**

_Effects for the Debtor_

As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary case retains its management power, but is subject to the
intervention (intervenci´on) of the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal), who is appointed by the
court. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced
(sustituci´on) by the insolvency trustee. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime
subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency trustee’s request, the
court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried
out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null
and void.

_Effects on Contracts_

Bankruptcy declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by both
parties by bankruptcy declaration (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the
obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. The court can nonetheless

449


-----

terminate (reject) any such contracts at the request of the insolvency trustee (provided that management’s
powers have been solely conferred upon the insolvency trustee), the company itself (if its powers to
manage and dispose of its business are only subject to the intervention of the insolvency trustee) when such
termination is in the interest of the estate (resoluci´on del contrato en inter´es del concurso), or terminate for
breach at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract. The
termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return consideration received or
indemnify its counterparty against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). On the other hand, the
judge may decide to cure any breach of the insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency trustee’s
request (assumption) (mantenimiento del contrato en inter´es del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent
party shall have a estate claim.

Creditors will be able to accelerate, but not to terminate executory contracts based only on bankruptcy
declaration (declaraci´on de concurso) of the debtor. All clauses in contracts with mutual obligations that
entitle any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency
(ipso facto clauses) are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore, unenforceable,
except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws).

Additionally, bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in _rem_
right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in favor
of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State Budget
(Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

In any event, setoff is prohibited unless the requirements for the setoff were satisfied prior to the
declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law that permits set-off.

As a general rule, bankruptcy declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral
necessary to pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in Royal Decree
Law 5/2005, which can be enforced as any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain).

The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the
commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the
earlier of: (i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition
agreement does not affect such right; or (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency
without the opening of the liquidation phase.

Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is
the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of
that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the
foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not
bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic
exploitation of the relevant asset. When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and
creditors, the law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is, then,
legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets
(whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law).

_Ranking of Credits_

The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within
a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Bolet´ın Oficial del
_Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original documentation_
that justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor,
the insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the
categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims against the debtor’s estate; (ii) claims
benefiting from special privileges; (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges; (iv) ordinary claims; and
(v) subordinated claims.

(a) Claims against the insolvency estate (cr´editos contra la masa) from Section 84 of the Spanish
Insolvency Act sets out the so-called ‘‘estate claims’’ which are pre-deductible claims from the estate
(excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are generally payable when
due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against the
insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and
expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts deriving from executory contracts and
obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent

450


-----

debtor, (iv) those amounts that derive from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency
proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration
received by it, if tied to bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising
from obligations created by law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of
insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration
of insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a Composition
Agreements in accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, (viii) 50% of the new
funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set
forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act; and (ix) the new
funds lent by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor in the context of a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the
4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act, provided further that such new funds do not
result from a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose.

(b) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem
_security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem_
securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the
creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the
secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act
minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified
according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail
separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may
last up to one year from the declaration of the insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in
the Spanish Insolvency Act. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement
proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency trustee has the
option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged
creditors are not subject to Composition Agreement, unless they give their express support by voting
in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors
holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the
composition agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such
composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the
secured assets on which they are secured.

(c) Claims benefiting from general privileges include, among others, certain labor debts and certain debts
with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts and
social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency
proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized as privileged for up to
50% of the amount of such debts. New funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in
compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the
Spanish Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (cr´edito
_contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to_
be affected by the restructuring (under a Composition Agreement) except if they give their express
support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express
support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or
75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims
benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. If
they do not agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect
payment (in the order established by law).

(d) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a pro-rated basis from
the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of estate claims and
generally privileged claims.

(e) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue
of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor. In
the case of individuals, this includes their relatives, legal entities controlled by the debtor or its
relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal entities, any other legal entity forming part
of the same group of companies and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this
paragraph are their factual and legal administrators. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be
deemed as ‘‘specially related parties’’: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such
shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as

451


-----

described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the
insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed)—when the shareholder is an
individual, those who would be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the
debtor; or (iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and those holding general powers of
attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these position during the
two years prior to the insolvency declaration); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the
debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding
requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or
indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 71.bis or the
4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a special
relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing
granted under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are
presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken
place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they do not vote on the Composition Agreement and in
the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act
(once ordinary creditors have been paid in full).

_Hardening Periods_

There is no automatic claw-back by virtue of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency trustee
may only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being ‘‘detrimental’’ to the insolvent
debtor’s estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration, even
in the absence of fraudulent intent (in accordance with Article 71.7 of the Spanish Insolvency Act,
transactions taking place four years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the general regime of
rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code).

‘‘Detriment’’ does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on
the debtor’s interests. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption, without
admission of proof to the contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary
largesse (liberalidades de uso) and (ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency
declaration (except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption) in
the case of (i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the
creation of in rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace existing
obligations and (iii) the cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling due after the
declaration of insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party
seeking rescission.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other
group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests
may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there
was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or security
(beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or
the so-called ‘‘group interest’’). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the
guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by
case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees.

If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together
with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor,
the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the
time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith,
the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be
classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith,
the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and
rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts.

452


-----

The exercise of rescission actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance with law,
which may be brought before the bankruptcy judge.

Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary
course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under market conditions,
(ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of
values and derivative instruments, and (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits
in favor of the labor authorities.

Neither ‘‘Refinancing Agreements,’’ nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any
guarantees instituted in the performance of such ‘‘Refinancing Agreements,’’ will be subject to an action
for rescission, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section ‘Protection of
Certain Refinancing Agreements’.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to the bankruptcy clawback action, the insolvency trustee and any creditor
may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acci´on rescisoria pauliana) against its debtor and
the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided the same is performed or entered
into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although
case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in
order for a creditor to bring such action:

- the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place
after such debt was created;

- the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

- such act was fraudulent;

- there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

- debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements
under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code:
(i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for
consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose
assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent.
The presumption referred to in (i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence),
unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a _juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable_
presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the consideration
received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor
would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the
consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third
party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

**_Protection of Certain Refinancing Agreements_**

Certain refinancing agreements denominated ‘‘Collective Refinancing Agreements’’ may be protected
from claw-back risk provided that they comply with certain requirements further explained in the section
referred to as ‘‘—Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements.’’

In the case that such refinancing agreements are not subject to the procedure of judicial sanctioning
therein described (homologaci´on), they may still have certain (but not total) protection against clawback, if
they are backed by at least 3/5 (60%) of the total claims of the insolvent debtor (calculated on an individual
and on a consolidated basis but excluding intragroup claims). Among other requisites, the refinancing
agreements must be founded on a viability plan reflecting that the insolvent debtor will be viable in the
short and medium term and must comply with the rest of requirements explained below.

453


-----

**_Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements_**

In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements can be judicially sanctioned
(homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential bankruptcy
proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing
agreements, if (i) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure
by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones with longer maturity dates;
(ii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the
debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish
Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions in order to
calculate whether the required thresholds are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iii) the
debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the
case of a group a companies, pursuant to certain precedents, the majority arguably refers both individually
to each company and to the group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not taken into account-),
and when the company has no auditor, by the one appointed for this purpose; and (iv) the agreement is
formalized in a public instrument and the documents that validate its content must be attached. Judicially
sanctioned refinancing agreements will not be subject to the bankruptcy claw-back action, but they may be
challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law.

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an
interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably
voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in
the syndicated loan agreement. Whether or not dissidents can be extended effects beyond those provided
by the law or object to homologation, and whether they have standing to object to homologation, is
controversial.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting
or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that
part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in
accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of the Spanish Insolvency Act and (ii) dissenting
secured creditors in respect of their secured claims, provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below:

a. If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60%
of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt
converted into so-called profit participation loans (pr´estamos participativos) of term up to five years.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured
claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

b. If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the
debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

i. stays of payments for up to ten years;

ii. haircuts;

iii. capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing
agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may
choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or, as default
option, (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share
premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a
consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap;

iv. conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations,
subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking,
maturity and features different to the original debt; and

v. assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio
_pro solute or datio pro solvendo)._

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured
claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

454


-----

**_Applicable Jurisdiction_**

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has
its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’ This ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is deemed to be where the insolvent party
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third
parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ are considered
‘‘the principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent
party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If
the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in
Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the ‘‘territorial insolvency
proceedings’’).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 87.3 of the current Spanish Insolvency Act may apply,
in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may be
classified as ‘‘contingent’’ claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and
the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee
is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of
preference (excusi´on), order (orden) and division (divisi´on) apply.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests_**

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary
obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or
security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or
termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation
terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and void. In the event that
the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or
secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations
under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or
security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as
applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be
affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured
obligations.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were
of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration,
a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and
cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the
Spanish Civil Code.

Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes
or to grant security interests over its assets to secure the Senior Secured Notes. Recent Spanish rulings
which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with
a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure
indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and
operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of
such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court
recognizing the validity of upstream guarantees.

Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or under any security
instrument granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of
the Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor
under the Notes Guarantee or any security granted or executed by such Spanish Guarantor:

- shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes for the purpose of acquiring
shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share
capital of its direct or indirect parent company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the
acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing
the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company; and

- shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the
same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and Article 143
of the Spanish Companies Law and, in that case, all provisions of such Notes Guarantee or security

455


-----

shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Notes Guarantee or security given
by the Spanish Guarantor provides any such unlawful financial assistance.

    - Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies
(sociedades an´onimas (S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares
of any direct or indirect parent company, and (ii) for private limited liability companies
(sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the acquisition of their own
shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law
governed guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuers
for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct
or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that
such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of
Article 150 and 143 of Spanish Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 on Spanish Corporations (Ley de
_Sociedades de Capital). This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt,_
although this is widely debated between academics. Accordingly, any guarantee or security
interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used
to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuers if such existing indebtedness was used for the
purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the
guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that
are not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes.

    - Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into
account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee
causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall
below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse),
unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the
balance between its net equity and its share capital, and _provided that it is not required to_
declare its insolvency.

In addition, and whilst this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain
defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed
under the Notes Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share capital of the Spanish Guarantor and
the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral.

Under the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el
_texto refundido de la Ley, de Sociedades de Capital), Spanish companies (both public limited liability_
companies (sociedades an´onimas (S.A.)) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de
_responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes_
and other securities that recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to limited liability
companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to Section 401 of the
Spanish Companies Act, the Guarantee provided by Spanish Guarantors incorporated under the form of
limited liability companies (‘‘sociedades de responsabilidad limitada’’ or ‘‘S.L.s’’), is subject to the following
restrictions: (a) S.L.s can only issue and guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its
own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public
guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution (b) S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or
provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales).

In respect of the restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad
_limitada (S.L.)), there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding_
the interpretation of Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act.

Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (5 years being the general term established for
obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (C´odigo Civil)) or may be or become
subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are
of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be

456


-----

enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any
event be subject to:

- the nature of the remedies available; and

- the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of
law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

Spanish law does not recognize the concepts of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘security agent’’ and there is some uncertainty as
to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a security agent (including the Security Agent)
and whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce
the collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit
appointing the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty
as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an
enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue that a security agent (such as the Security Agent) or a
trustee (such as the applicable Trustee) would only be entitled to enforce its portion of the secured
obligation but not that of the other secured parties. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security
interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee,
and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, may be subject to a due and
express power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties in favor of the Security Agent and/or the
Trustee for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized (and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance
with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961).

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the
Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has
not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not
expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not
hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the
applicable Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may be challenged.

According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the
place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as
receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical
existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish scholars so as to
determine the _lex rei sitae (such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of_
pledgor, law governing the credit right being pledged, etc.). If a judge considered that any of the pledges
created over credit rights under the Spanish security documents is governed by the Catalonian Civil Code,
then this regulation would govern those pledges instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could
determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges.

The concept of ‘‘parallel debt’’ may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any court
precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court.

Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive
summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain,
having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in The Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding concerning
any of such Guarantors would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in The Netherlands
in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary
insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a
going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and
distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in
bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

457


-----

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will
be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a
court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator
(bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft
composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments,
the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more
than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more
than one-third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured
non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be
withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of
payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike
Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors
are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under
Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce
their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were
no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that
does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the
court can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which
can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by
secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition
(akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and
non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented
at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and
admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and
could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest
payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in
a composition.

_Parallel Debt_

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security
Agent (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal
obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the ‘‘Principal
Obligations’’), and a pledge under any Dutch Share Pledge will be granted to the Security Agent to secure
only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no
certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch Share Pledge posed by
Dutch law.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch Share Pledge is successfully challenged, holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch
Share Pledge. In addition, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the
aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and
payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The

458


-----

general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the _paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which_
means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings
shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as
secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the
rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a
Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their
terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch Guarantor will be accelerated and become due
and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver
(curator) to be verified. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of
the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the
purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been
payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest
payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking
of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.
Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and
all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or
value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of
their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such _renvooi proceedings_
could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims.
As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered
to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple
majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in
amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed
by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of
classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential
creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata
basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings.
The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ for a maximum of two months (which can be
extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors
are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge.
Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a
reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and
the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant.
Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against
an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set-off
relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or
other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be
subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for
set-off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including,
without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a
third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can
be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy. See below ‘‘—Fraudulent Transfer.’’

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of
judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to
secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law.
Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds
resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors
under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors

459


-----

have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically
stayed.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or
security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the
guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver
(curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment
proceedings (surseance van betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and
enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the
interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the
articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the
company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the
transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between
the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is
determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company
that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the
enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be
successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the
company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which
it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security
interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such
guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial
interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the
guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is
determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial
benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any
security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the
document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress
(bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment
pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an
insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden), force majeure (niet-toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness_
(redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off
(verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company
may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or
more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled
thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security
itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or
avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably
ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to
meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the
creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the
director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently
(voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a legal entity may, under
certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee or security interest was
granted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/
were prejudiced as a consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the

460


-----

time the guarantee or security interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee or
security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security
interest knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security
interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all
creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is
presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be
prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing
requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply _mutatis mutandis when_
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may
challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation
to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or
(ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the
debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a
Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can
be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on
collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be
subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of
payments prior to obtaining title thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created,
in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private
limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not
constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any pre-existing security.

**Republic of Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Ireland and have their registered offices in
Ireland (the ‘‘RoI Guarantors’’). Under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, each RoI Guarantor’s
centre of main interest (‘‘COMI’’) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the
absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the relevant RoI Guarantor did not move its registered
office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.

As each RoI Guarantor’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of
the relevant RoI Guarantor would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might
constitute ‘‘proof to the contrary’’ regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in
Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ((2004) 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); (2006) IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); (2006)
Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in
the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference
from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that ‘‘factors which are both
objective and ascertainable by third parties’’ would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual
situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance,
if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut
the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office
in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent
undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

If the relevant RoI Guarantor’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main
insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.

RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the RoI
Guarantors and any security interests granted by the RoI Guarantors.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of RoI insolvency laws relating to certain limitations
on the Guarantees and security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are provided by the RoI
Guarantors.

461


-----

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
Guarantees or the Collateral securing the Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive. The STADA
Group has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in RoI which are commonly created in RoI
over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Under RoI law, there are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating
charge security: (a) an examiner appointed to the charging company can deal with floating charge assets;
(b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the
floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s
remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the
assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating
charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to
give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;
(e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under Irish insolvency law (please see
‘‘—Challenges to Guarantees and Security—Grant of Floating Charge’’); and (f) floating charge security is
subject to the claims of preferential creditors in a winding-up (such as certain taxes, occupational pension
scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed
to employees).

Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to
be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the
parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security
interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee
has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the
proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor
is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court
is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it
may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the
assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold
that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.

**_Preferred Creditors Under RoI Law_**

Under Section 621 (Preferential Payments in a winding up) (‘‘Section 621’’) of the Companies Act 2014 (as
amended, the ‘‘Companies Act’’) in a winding-up of an RoI company certain preferential debts are
required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts
therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company
available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are
required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the
Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from June 9, 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a
floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding-up of that company,
even if that floating charge has crystallized. Under Section 440 (Preferential Payments when receiver
appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver
appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the
company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that
property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would
comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the
RoI Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employeerelated taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of
employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation.

In addition, there is a further limited category of super-preferential creditors which take priority, not only
over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These
super-preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner
of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s
requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts, (see
‘‘—Examinership’’ below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company

462


-----

by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE and VAT
arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created.

Furthermore, and as referred to above (see ‘‘—Fixed and Floating Charges’’), in the case of the application
of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a
winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of
floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.

**_Examinership_**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of the
whole or part of an RoI company the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of an
examiner and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.
In circumstances where an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the
directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of
that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the paid-up
voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an
examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate its survival (and all or part of its
undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the ROI company may be placed under the
protection of the relevant Irish court (the ‘‘Court’’) for a period of time whilst its affairs are investigated by
an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is capable of being rescued and to
supervise the restructuring process.

Where the Court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an
order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies Act to a related company
of such company. Once confirmed by the Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members
and creditors. During the protection period the day-to-day business of the company remains under the
control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the Court.

Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme
of arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme of
arrangement will involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured, contingent
and actual) that are in existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the company of new
funds. The examiner has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company
after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company
prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject
of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the
holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders
of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. Having formulated his proposals, he must
convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors as he thinks proper to consider acceptance of
his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on the outcome of his meetings within 35 days of his
appointment, although the 35 day period can be extended by the Court. There is acceptance by creditors or
by a class of creditors when a majority in number representing a majority in value of the claims represented
at the meeting vote in favor of the proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court if they are to
become effective and the Court can confirm the proposals only if, _inter alia: (a) at least one class of_
creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals have accepted
them; (b) the Court is satisfied that the proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members
or creditors that has not accepted them and whose interests and claims would be impaired by
implementation; and (c) they are not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party.

Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether
secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may
be, affected by the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified.

For as long as a company is under the protection of the Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or
execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the
consent of the examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors and others) of
the Companies Act provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the examiner:

- where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance or
a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or income of the ROI
company, no action may be taken to realize the whole or any part of such security;

463


-----

- no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the ROI company shall be appointed (and
if a receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to act); and

- no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for winding
up of the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect).

In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies Act,
no payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of satisfaction or
discharge of the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date upon which the
petition for the examiner’s appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s report under
Section 511 (Independent expert’s report) of the Companies Act that accompanied the petition
recommended that all or part of that liability be discharged or satisfied, or such payment is authorized by
the Relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any interested party) where the Relevant Irish
court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part that liability would considerably
reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as a going
concern.

Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be
under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending
70 days later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the
examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as the
Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s
final report). In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further
extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal.

Furthermore, the Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed
by the Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the
related contract amounted to an unfair preference.

_Primary Risks for Holders of Notes in an Examinership_

The primary risks to the holders of the Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if an examiner were appointed to
an RoI Guarantor and/or to a company related to such an RoI company and where any amounts due under
the Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of an
RoI Guarantor of the Notes and of any payment obligations contained in a guarantee given by any other
related company subject to the examinership proceedings; (b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of
arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by an RoI
Guarantor to the holders of the Notes; (c) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being
approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the
Notes by a company related to such an RoI Guarantor; (d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set
aside any negative pledge prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the RoI
Guarantor to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the guarantor or issuer during the protection period;
and (e) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved in respect of an RoI company guarantor
of the Notes and the guarantor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and
expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the guarantor and approved
by the RoI High Court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or
may become due, owing or payable by it to the holders of the Notes.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under RoI insolvency law in which the granting by an RoI company of security
and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is
appointed to the RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of
the security or giving of the guarantee and, in addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when
the security interest was granted or when the guarantee was given or ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ within the
meaning of the Companies Act as a result.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees:

_Unfair Preference_

Under Irish insolvency law, if an ROI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to
have certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604

464


-----

(Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the Companies Act
(‘‘Section 604’’) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other
act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they
become due in favor of any creditor of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a
view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over
the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid
accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within six months of the doing of the act and the
company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to pay its debts (taking into account
contingent and prospective liabilities).

_Improperly Transferred Assets_

Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred)
of the Companies Act (‘‘Section 608’’), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or
contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any
property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or
mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to ‘‘perpetrate a fraud’’ on the company, its creditors or
members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to
have ‘‘use, control or possession’’ of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development
of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the
High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets has been extended to
receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair
preference for the purposes of Section 604.

_Disclaimer of Onerous Contracts_

Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the Companies
Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the
company. ‘‘Onerous property’’ is defined to include any ‘‘unprofitable contract’’ and ‘‘any other property
(of the company) which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to
the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.’’

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating
charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favor of a ‘‘connected
person’’) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be
proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not
apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied
to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with
interest at the appropriate rate.

_General_

If an RoI Guarantor becomes subject to an RoI law insolvency proceeding and that company has
obligations to creditors that are treated under RoI law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to
the Noteholders, the Noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such
insolvency proceeding.

The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis that it is
prohibited under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and
unenforceable. Further, guarantees by the Irish guarantors for the obligations of another group company
must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish guarantors. If the giving of a
guarantee is not for the Irish guarantors’ corporate benefit, the guarantees could be held null and void.
The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given
to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is
particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees. The question whether or not the corporate
benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the
company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If
the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the

465


-----

company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantees could be declared
null and void. The validity and/or enforceability of the guarantees may also be subject to the statutes of
limitations, defences such as set-off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of
estoppel, and the fact that equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion.

Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the
Companies Act (‘‘Section 82’’), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and
whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for
the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for
any shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the notes may only be guaranteed by the
relevant ROI company to the extent that it would not result in such guarantee constituting the giving of
unlawful financial assistance under Section 82.

Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book
debts of an RoI tax-resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners to
pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by
the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI Revenue Commissioners of
the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of
certain outstanding RoI tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax)
arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners.

The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax-resident company by another
person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the
liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of
the RoI Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating)
over the debt in question.

**Northern Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Northern Ireland (the ‘‘NI Guarantor’’).
Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the NI Guarantor are likely to be governed by the laws of
Northern Ireland. Insolvency laws in Northern Ireland may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws
of the United States and other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Where the NI Guarantor
experiences financial difficulties, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or
similar proceedings.

Northern Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided
by the NI Guarantor and any security interests granted by the NI Guarantor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Northern Irish insolvency laws relating to certain
limitations on the Notes Guarantees and security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are
provided by the NI Guarantor.

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes
Guarantees or the Collateral securing the Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive. The Group
has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in Northern Ireland which are commonly created in
Northern Ireland over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges.

**_General_**

The laws relating to insolvency and the validity/enforceability of guarantees and security are broadly the
same as those in England and Wales but substantially different from those equivalent laws in Northern
Ireland.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Northern Irish company should be commenced
in Northern Ireland based on Northern Irish insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of
Northern Irish companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances. Formal
insolvency proceedings under the laws of Northern Ireland may be initiated in a number of ways, including
by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application for administration,
(ii) the company, its directors, or certain creditors appointing administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor
filing a petition to wind-up a Northern Irish company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the
case of liquidation).

466


-----

A Northern Irish company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into
administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably
likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended), a company is deemed to be unable to
pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is
unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a ‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt
(or similar court order).

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can (without the floating charge holder’s consent)
convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet
administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging
company) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge,
even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the
charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of a liquidator) properly
incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets the
subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security
crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the
ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging
company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise
to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) there are
particular challenge risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating charge security is subject to
the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries
(including holiday pay) owed to employees) and to ring-fencing (see below ‘‘—Northern Ireland—
_Administration and Floating Charges’’)._

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed
security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges
because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on
whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in
the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in
practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the
court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding
that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended by the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order
2005 and as otherwise amended) empowers courts in Northern Ireland to make an administration order in
respect of a Northern Irish company in certain circumstances.

An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to
become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order
1989 and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the statutory purpose of
administration.

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a
qualifying floating charge which has become enforceable. During the administration, no proceedings or
other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company in administration, or security
enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator
(the statutory moratorium). Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their
security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium.

In England and Wales the statutory moratorium does not apply to security interests created or arising
under a ‘‘financial collateral agreement’’ (generally, security/collateral in respect of cash or financial

467


-----

instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the ‘‘2003 Regulations’’).

The 2003 Regulations were implemented at a time when the Enterprise Act 2002 was in force in England
and Wales; however the equivalent provisions in Northern Ireland were not introduced until the Insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 2005 (the ‘‘2005 Order’’) came into force. The 2005 Order introduced Schedule
B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and replaced Part III of the Insolvency (Northern
Ireland) Order 1989 which the 2003 Regulations had amended as far as financial collateral arrangements
were concerned. Following this, the Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality and Financial
Collateral Arrangements) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (the ‘‘2010 Regulations’’) reflected the changes
brought about to the administration regime in Northern Ireland, as a consequence of the implementation
of the 2005 Order.

However, there appears to be one omission, which is the failure of the 2010 Regulations to disable the
effect of Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, in relation to a
receiver appointed pursuant to a financial collateral arrangement.

Therefore, if a Northern Irish company were to enter administration, it is possible that the security or the
guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or
consent of the administrator. In addition, as stated above, Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 has not been disapplied by the 2003 Regulations or the 2010
Regulations. Accordingly, there is a risk that any receiver appointed over an asset of a Northern Irish
company under a financial collateral arrangement may be required to vacate office by an administrator of
that entity if an administrator was appointed pursuant to the laws of Northern Ireland.

There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain this leave of court or consent of the
administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be
appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed receiver
must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no
other receiver may be appointed over that company’s fixed assets (commonly referred to as a fixed charge
receiver) without the leave of a court of a competent jurisdiction in Northern Ireland (the ‘‘Northern Irish
Court’’) or the administrator’s consent.

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the
company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Northern Irish obligor must constitute a ‘‘qualifying
floating charge’’ for the purposes of Northern Irish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint
an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates
March 27, 2006, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as
amended) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a
qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the
relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator
of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the
meaning given by Article 5(1) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). The
Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if
necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the
relevant Northern Irish obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating
charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is
the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989, as amended), which will apply if a Northern Irish obligor creates a debt of at least £50,000,000
for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a
‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as
amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver or
liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of
enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses
(floating charge realizations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to
50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a
maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other
security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant Northern Irish obligor’s assets at the time
that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

468


-----

**_Liquidation_**

The NI Guarantor may be wound up under the laws of Northern Ireland. This means that the NI
Guarantor would be placed into either Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation or Compulsory Liquidation, both
of which are insolvent liquidations. The NI Guarantor is not referring to the process of Members’
Voluntary Liquidation which is a solvent winding up and outside the scope of this analysis.

On the liquidation of a Northern Irish company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place
preventing, amongst other things, the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those
security interests. Where the NI Guarantor is placed into Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation, there are no
restrictions on the holder of security either by way of fixed or floating charge from taking steps to enforce
those security interests unless the liquidator or any creditor has applied to a court for a stay. However,
where the NI Guarantor is placed into Compulsory Liquidation, the consent of a Northern Irish Court is
strictly required before any security interest can be enforced. In addition, with compulsory liquidation
where the obligations under the Notes Guarantees are unsecured because of some inherent defect in the
security interest, that guarantor cannot take action or commence proceedings to recover the amounts due
on foot of the guarantee without the consent of a Northern Irish Court by virtue of Article 110(3) of the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended).

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under Northern Irish insolvency law in which the granting by a Northern Irish
company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the Northern
Irish company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the
guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed
to a Northern Irish company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or
guarantee given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Northern Irish law to guarantees and
security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could
apply to a Northern Irish Court for an Order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee
if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee
constituted a gift or transfer for no or significantly less consideration. There will only be a transaction at an
undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the Northern Irish company
was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989). The transaction is subject to potential challenge if the Northern Irish company enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Northern Irish
company grants the security interest or guarantee. However, a Northern Irish Court generally will not
intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business
and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the
company. The Issuers cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency, the granting of
the security by the NI Guarantor would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court
would support the analysis that (in any event) the guarantee was entered into in good faith for the
purposes described above. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction was a transaction at
an undervalue, a Northern Irish Court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it
would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent unless a
beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person
must demonstrate the solvency of the Northern Irish company in such proceedings.

_Preference_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could
apply to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if
such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee
constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into,
the Northern Irish company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)

469


-----

Order 1989, as amended) or the Northern Irish company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) as a consequence of its entry into the transaction.
The transaction can be challenged if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the Northern Irish
company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Northern Irish
company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the
event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would
otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If a Northern Irish Court determines
that the transaction constituted such a preference, a Northern Irish Court has very wide powers for
restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this
case, include reducing payments under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (although there is protection
for a third-party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for a
Northern Irish Court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Northern Irish
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent at the relevant
time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the
beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and
was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which
that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. An application to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the transaction
may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of
being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of a Northern Irish Court in the case of a company
in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time
limit in the Northern Irish insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant
company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If a Northern Irish Court determines
that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, a Northern Irish Court can make such orders as
it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into
and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the
transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was
acquired from a third-party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and
will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Avoidance of Floating Charge_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, if a Northern Irish company is unable to pay its debts at the time of
(or as a result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified
period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the value of the
money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
Northern Irish company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge.

The requirement for the Northern Irish company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting
the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the
floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified
period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
Northern Irish company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the
relevant Northern Irish company is solvent or insolvent.

470


-----

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant Northern Irish company enters
into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant
Northern Irish company grants the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security
financial collateral agreement’’ under the 2003 Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to
challenge as described in this paragraph.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the Notes and/or the Guarantees offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees (together, the ‘‘Securities’’) have not been and will not be registered under
the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the
Securities are registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction is available. Accordingly, the
Securities are being offered and sold only (i) to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A,
‘‘QIBs’’) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in an offshore
transaction (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Securities under the Securities Act and, therefore, the
Securities may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Securities to the Initial
Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms ‘‘U.S. person,’’ ‘‘offshore transaction’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to
have acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms
used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Securities are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (ii) the Securities may not be offered, sold
or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is either (a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account
of another QIB, or (b) it is a non-U.S. person and it is purchasing the Securities outside the United
States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that none of the Issuers, the Group, the Target Group, the Initial Purchasers, or any
person representing any of the foregoing, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the
offer or sale of any Securities, other than the information contained in or incorporated by reference in
this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is

financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask
questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither
the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum or the information
incorporated by reference herein;

(5) it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will
be deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Securities
or any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date which is, in the case of
Securities offered to QIBs, one year after the later of the original issue date of such Securities, the
original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last date on which the issuer or
any affiliate of the issuer was the owner of such Security (or any predecessor of such Security) and, in
the case of Securities offered to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S, 40 days after the
later of the original issue date of such Security and the date on which such Security (or any
predecessor of such Security) was first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in
Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S only (a) to the Issuers, the Guarantors or any
subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under
the Securities Act, (c) for so long as such Security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ as defined in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act that purchases for its own account or for the account of a
qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur
outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to compliance with any applicable state
securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the issuer’s right
prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (e) to require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to it, including a certificate of transfer in
the form appearing on the reverse of such Security.

(6) it understands that the Securities will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

If you purchase Securities, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities;

Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Registrar that
the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

(9) it acknowledges that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of its
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the

make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each
such investor account; and

(10) it understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of
the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under ‘‘Notice to U.S. Investors,’’
‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and ‘‘Plan of Distribution.’’

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers
have agreed to purchase from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the
Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Senior Notes. Each of the sales will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering
memorandum (together the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Notes Issuer, respectively, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the
Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Senior Secured Notes if they purchase any of them and will
purchase all the Senior Notes if they purchase any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that
appear on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may
change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice.
The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect
of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker
dealer intends to effect any sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S.
registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to
investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuers have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the
delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial
Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased
or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated.

Certain of the Sponsors or their affiliates have placed a purchase order for and been allocated Senior
Secured Notes and Senior Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue prices set forth on the
cover page of this offering memorandum, subject to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount in
respect of the Notes purchased by such persons.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers, German Holdco and each Post-Control Date
Guarantor (as of the date of its accession to the Purchase Agreement) will indemnify and hold harmless
the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have
agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the purchase
agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers, German Holdco and (as of the Control
Date) the Post-Control Date Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the
Notes during the period from the date of the purchase agreement through and including the date falling
45 days after the closing of the Offerings without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets
Limited and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days
after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or
sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or
not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in

475


-----

this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under ‘‘Important Information About This Offering Memorandum’’ and ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or any Guarantor;
and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale
of the Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer have also agreed that they will not at any
time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under
circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded
by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be
applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuers have applied,
through their listing sponsor, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of
the Exchange, however, the Issuers cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained,
maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the
Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series
_of Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_
_will be limited.’’_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be five Business Days (as such term is
used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + 5’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in two Business Days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this
offering memorandum or the next two succeeding Business Days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who
wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing
transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids
do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open

476


-----

market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the
Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by
that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or
maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the offering, creating a
syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate
short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making
transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may
stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise
prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these
activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for,
the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.’’_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on
or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these
activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of
the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in
the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide
in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to us and our
affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees
and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In
addition, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Barclays Bank PLC,
Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, ING Bank, a branch of ING-DiBA AG, Jefferies
International Limited, Nomura International plc, Soci´et´e G´en´erale and UBS AG, London Branch or their
respective affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities
and the Bridge Facilities that we have entered into as borrowers and drawn to provide financing for the
Acquisition. Barclays Bank plc is acting as agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Bridge
Facilities. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the proceeds from
the offering of the Senior Notes will be used to refinance the Bridge Facilities. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ The
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements we
expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions, and will receive customary fees for their services
in such capacities. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers advised the Sponsors on the Acquisition
and provided a cash confirmation of funding in respect of the Takeover Offer, and were paid fees in
connection with such services. Soci´et´e G´en´erale (or one of its affiliates) provides lending services to the
Target under various local facilities.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours
or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also
make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short
positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**Germany**

The Issuers and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. Our directors and
executive officers live outside the United States. Virtually all of our assets and the assets of our directors
and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an
agent for service of process under the Indentures governing the Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve
process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against
them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of
civil liabilities based on the state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an
action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and Germany currently do not
have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by
any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized
and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a
German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court,
except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is
conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

- the judgment being final under U.S. law;

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

- the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served
complaint;

- the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized
judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

- the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the procedure of a matter pending before a
German court, provided that such matter was pending before a German court before the U.S. court
entered its judgment;

- the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with German public policy,
including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce
judgments in Germany will be successful.

German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages. Moreover, a German
court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent
that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial
compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial
discovery process exists under German law.

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities
laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in
U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have
a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration
awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on
the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for
payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon

478


-----

U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment
by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before
a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in
section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did
not have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign
court which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a
proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtsh¨angig) before a German court before the U.S.
federal or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with fundamental principles of
German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the
effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(verm¨ogensrechtliche Anspr¨uche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court
would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal
securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as
incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as
being of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provided for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to
trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial
discovery process exists under German law.

In addition, it may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the
German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law
implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security,
which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the
civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and

479


-----

commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in
the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such
U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent
jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually
be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it).
Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without
proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an
action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that
the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction
according to the rules of English private international law);

- the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable
in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human
Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent
applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or
in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or
revenue law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or
other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior
inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention member state of the European Union or a
Member State which the English Court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention
Choice of Court Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the
Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007;

- the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.;

- the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court;
and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is
questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings
were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England
and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar
proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.
Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that
could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject
of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**Spain**

Although the Notes will not be guaranteed by any guarantors incorporated in Spain due to applicable
financial assistance rules, certain of STADA’s subsidiaries in Spain guarantee the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities up to the amount drawn under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that is applied toward the
repayment of the Existing Debt (each, a ‘‘Spanish Guarantor’’). Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
any proceeds from the Spanish guarantees received by the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement will be shared with the lenders in respect of certain hedging obligations and holders
of the Senior Secured Notes on a _pari passu basis and, to the extent that such obligations have been_
discharged in full, the holders of the Senior Notes on a subordinated basis. As a result, the description of
Spanish law set forth below discusses the service of process on, and enforcement of civil liabilities against,
the Spanish Guarantors of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, because such guarantees may indirectly
benefit the holders of the Notes.

A final judgment obtained against the Issuers or any of the Guarantors outside of Spain (and, in particular,
in the United States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council, would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Spain (unless
such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy) pursuant to the following regimes:

- according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between
Spain and the United States for these purposes);

- in the absence of any such treaty, if it could be proven that the jurisdiction in which the foreign
judgment was rendered recognizes Spanish judgments on a reciprocal basis (positive reciprocity) and
provided that certain minimum conditions are met (among others, that the matter is not exclusively
subject to Spanish jurisdiction, does not infringe public policy and does not contradict a previous
Spanish judgment). If it could be proven (usually by the defendant) that the U.S. jurisdiction in which
the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts, then the Spanish
courts would not recognize the U.S. judgment in Spain (negative reciprocity); and

- in the absence of any such treaty and where reciprocity has not been evidenced (and, according to
certain court precedents, even if positive reciprocity has been evidenced), the judgment would be
enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements in compliance with and subject to
Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuciamiento Civil) and
subject to Law 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015,
_de 30 de julio, de Cooperaci´on Jur´ıdica Internacional en materia civil) (the ‘‘Law on International Legal_
_Cooperation in Civil Matters’’) which repeals Articles 951 to 958 of the former Spanish Civil Procedure_
Act of 1881 (Real Decreto de Promulgaci´on de 3 de febrero de 1881 de Enjuciamiento Civil):

(i) such U.S. judgment is final and conclusive (firme);

(ii) the judgment is rendered as a result of an action in personam as opposed to an action in rem;

(iii) the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in
Spain;

(iv) the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement meets all the legal
requirements under the law of the jurisdiction in which the judgment was rendered in order to be
considered an authentic judgment and it also meets all requirements under the laws of Spain to
be admitted (the judgment is final, and a literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation and
apostilled copy is provided);

(v) there is not a pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in
Spain;

(vi) there is not a judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in
Spain or in another country; provided that, the judgment has been recognized in Spain;

(vii) where rendering the judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of
jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and
the choice of court is not fraudulent; and

(viii)the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including,
but not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to
prepare its defense.

-----

Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking
declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First
Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil).

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due
and payable by each Issuer or Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest
will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country
bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs:
(a) translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a
sworn translation into Spanish; (b) certain professional fees for the verification of the legal authority of a
party litigating in Spain, if needed; (c) judicial tax and fees; and (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating
in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent
(procurador). In addition, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by
agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the
Senior Secured Notes.

**The Netherlands**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantors’’). As a result, it may
be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantors.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court
in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal
securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to
obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a
competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the courts of The Netherlands may be expected to render
a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a
final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction vis-`a-vis the relevant
Dutch Guarantor on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been
rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the public policy
_(openbare orde) of The Netherlands, and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch_
court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court
rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the
same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in The
Netherlands.

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement
and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of
the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Republic of Ireland**

As the United States is not a party to a convention with the Republic of Ireland in respect of the
enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the
courts of the State of New York is enforceable in the Republic of Ireland. A judgment of the courts of the
State of New York will be enforced by the courts of the RoI if the following general requirements are met:

(i) the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant
according to the Republic of Ireland conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the
defendant would satisfy this rule); and

(ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court
which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if
an appeal is pending. Where however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to
stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be
actionable in the Republic of Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in
default of appearance is final and conclusive.

482


-----

However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York which
meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:

(i) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;

(ii) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;

(iii) the enforcement of the judgment in the Republic of Ireland would be contrary to natural or
constitutional justice;

(iv) the judgment is contrary to the Republic of Ireland public policy or involves certain United States laws
which will not be enforced in the Republic of Ireland; or

(v) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement
proceedings by personal service in the Republic of Ireland or outside the Republic of Ireland under
Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

**Northern Ireland**

The United States and the UK do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the UK are
both parties to the New York Convention on Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary
judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law
action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in
this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to the matters identified below)
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if:

- the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of
private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and

- the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum
payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or
otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other
public law).

A Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that:

- the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in
Northern Ireland;

- the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount
of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

- the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period;

- before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of
a final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is
enforceable in Northern Ireland;

- the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice
were breached;

- the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction
the judgment debtor did not submit); or

- an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments
(Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S.
court.

If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish
judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or
becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

**NOTES**

**1. General**

**1.1. Accounting policies**

This interim report of STADA complies with the requirements of Section 37w of the German Securities
Trading Act (WpHG) and, in accordance with Section 37w (3) of the WpHG, includes consolidated interim
financial statements and a group interim management report. The Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements have been prepared under consideration of the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) for interim reporting as applicable in the European Union (EU).

The Group Interim Management Report was prepared under consideration of the applicable WpHG
regulations. The Consolidated Interim Financial Statements as of June 30, 2017 were prepared under
consideration of the regulations outlined in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34. In accordance
with the provisions of IAS 34, an abridged scope of reporting as compared to the Consolidated Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2016 was selected.

All IFRSs published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU
which are mandatory for financial years starting as of January 1, 2017 have been observed by STADA.

In these Consolidated Interim Financial Statements—with the exception of the changed accounting
policies listed in Note 1.2.—the same accounting policies and methods of computation are applied as in the
Consolidated Financial Statements for financial year 2016. With regard to the principles and methods used
in the context of Group Accounting, we generally refer to the notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Annual Report 2016.

**1.2. Changes in accounting policies**

In the first six months of 2017, STADA observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and
amendments to pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, which were first
applicable as of January 1, 2017. The changes had no or no significant effect on the presentation of
STADA’s business, financial, earnings situation or cash flow.

**The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB:**

In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and
includes guidelines for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments. Furthermore,
IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be applied for
financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. An examination of
the impact of the application of IFRS 9 on the consolidated financial statements has not yet been
completed. As a result of the new guidelines for the impairment of financial instruments, in some cases
expected future losses may lead to earlier recognition of expenses.

In May 2014, IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs the revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular
replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. An
examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 15 on the consolidated financial statements has not
yet been completed. However, the new standard on the realization of sales will have little impact on sales
accounting, as sales are largely realized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of routine
transactions. There are no agreements in the Group which regulate multiple services within one contract
or within several contracts (multi-element arrangements). Changes may occur exclusively in the accounting
of licensing agreements, which amounted to less than 2% of the total sales revenue in financial year 2016.
However, this only affects license agreements which are not bound by the sales achieved by the licensee
and which grant the licensee the right to use the license, without further actions by STADA being required.
For such license agreements, as a result of the new IFRS 15 standard, in future sales will be realized in the
amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore not, as they are presently,
divided over the term of the license.

In January 2016, the IASB published the new IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ standard, which determines the recording
of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (liabilities) associated with leases in the balance sheet for
lessees. Lessees are no longer required to classify leases as finance leases or operating leases. IFRS 16 is to

be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. An
examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the consolidated financial statements has not
yet been completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet as
required by IFRS 16, an increase of the balance sheet total is expected at the point of initial application.
Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of the changes from IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization
and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on
EBITDA. Adoption into European law in accordance with IFRS 16 is still pending.

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected
from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**1.3. Scope of consolidation**

The Consolidated Interim Financial Statements of STADA have been prepared for STADA Arzneimittel
AG as a parent company.

As part of the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG, the most
up-to-date planning information available was used for STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd. for April to June
2017 as a result of a lack of financial information, although STADA retains legal control. The share of
financial information processed in this way in the Consolidated Financial Statements represents approx.
1% of Group sales, approx. 2% of EBITDA and approx. 1% of net income.

On January 1, 2017, STADA Pharmaceuticals Australia, Sydney, based in Australia, was included in the
scope of consolidation.

Furthermore, the acquisition of Serbian Velexfarm d.o.o., Belgrade, was completed in accordance with
corporate law in the first quarter of 2017. The company was consolidated as a subsidiary for the first time
on January 1, 2017.

STADA Import/Export International Ltd., Hong Kong, China, was also sold in the first quarter of 2017.
The transaction was completed on March 29, 2017. The assets and liabilities of the company were reported
as non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and associated liabilities as of December 31, 2016.
A gain of A 0.2 million was recorded with the deconsolidation of the company as of March 31, 2017.

Furthermore, on June 30, 2017, the legal merger of the German branded products companies
STADA GmbH and STADAvita GmbH, subsequently trading as STADA GmbH, was completed as was the
merger of STADApharm GmbH and cell pharm Gesellschaft f¨ur pharmazeutische und diagnostische
Pr¨aparate mbH, subsequently trading as STADAPHARM GmbH.

In the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements of the STADA Group, 83 companies were thereby
consolidated as subsidiaries and four companies as associates as of the balance sheet date of June 30, 2017.

**1.4. Business combinations**

In the first six months of 2017, the following significant business combinations as defined by IFRS 3
occurred, for which the preliminary purchase price allocations are described in more detail below.

The Serbian subsidiary of STADA Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm A.D., acquired Serbian pharmaceutical
wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o., based in Belgrade, Serbia, to strengthen the business activities on the Serbian
market. The acquisition was completed with the aim of vertical integration in the Serbian market. The
purchase price for the acquisition will total a maximum of A 1.0 million and will be or has already been fully
paid in cash. This includes certain conditional purchase price components to be paid following the
completion of operating tax inspections for the period before the acquisition. These components amount
to a maximum of A 0.3 million. The purchase was completed on January 6, 2017 after the competition
authorities approved the purchase contract signed in October 2016.

The provisional purchase price allocation from this merger resulted in goodwill of A 0.1 million, which was
attributable to the following:

Goodwill resulted primarily from vertical integration in the Serbian market.

For the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the context of the business combination, the following
fair values were recognized at the acquisition date:

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the evaluation of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

The gross figure of trade accounts receivable amounted to A 10.2 million, A 0.1 million of which was
deemed not recoverable. Trade accounts receivable were recorded at their fair value in the amount of
A 10.1 million.

Business relationships with Serbian Hemofarm A.D. had already existed before the acquisition. In financial
year 2016, these sales amounted to A 8.9 million.

Sales recorded in the first six months of 2017 amounted to around A 33.0 million. The operating profit of
this business combination adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (around A 0.3 million)
amounted to around A 0.2 million in this period.

**2. Notes to the Consolidated Income Statements**

**2.1. Sales**

The increase in sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year primarily resulted from
sales growth in Russia, Serbia and Belgium. The influences of exchange rate effects and portfolio changes
on the sales increase amounted to a total of 4.3 percentage points in the reporting period. Details on how
sales are broken down according to segments and regions can be found in segment reporting (see Note 5)
and in additional information (see Note 6).

**2.2. Cost of sales and gross profit**

Cost of sales increased in line with increased sales to A 575.8 million in the reporting period (1-6/2016:
A 529.3 million). The increase in cost of sales was lower than the increase in sales, particularly due to an
exchange-rate related improvement in purchasing conditions in the CIS subgroup.

**NOTES (Continued)**

**2. Notes to the Consolidated Income Statements (Continued)**

Gross profit increased to A 567.4 million in the first six months of 2017 (1-6/2016: A 505.4 million). The
gross margin improved to 49.6% (1-6/2016: 48.8%). This was particularly attributable to an improved
discount rate in the German Generics segment, for example as a result of the STADApharm discount
agreements, which fully expired in December 2016, as well as the Generics and Branded Products
segments in the Serbian subgroup.

**2.3. Selling expenses**

Selling expenses increased to A 243.6 million in the reporting period (1-6/2016: A 232.8 million). This
development was primarily based on increased marketing and sales expenses in the Branded Products
segment, particularly in Russia, the United Kingdom and Italy.

**2.4. Other income**

Other income recorded growth to A 11.7 million in the reporting period (1-6/2016: A 8.4 million). This
development was primarily attributable to write-ups on non-current assets in the Branded Products
segment.

**2.5. Other expenses**

Other expenses increased to A 64.5 million in the first six months of 2017 (1-6/2016: A 22.9 million). This
development was primarily due to increased impairments on non-current assets in the Branded Products
segment, of which Fultium-D3 vitamin drops are the largest single item, as well as consultancy expenses in
connection with the takeover process and write-downs on trade accounts receivable.

**2.6. Financial expenses**

The decline in financial expenses to A 23.1 million in the first six months of 2017 (1-6/2016: A 27.0 million)
was primarily attributable to the measurement of derivative financial instruments and lower interest
expenses.

**2.7. Income taxes**

Income tax expenses increased slightly to A 24.9 million (1-6/2016: A 24.7 million) in the reporting period.
The reported tax rate improved to 20.7% (1-6/2016: 22.2%). This development primarily resulted from the
reversal of tax provisions, among other things, in connection with a completed agreement procedure.

**2.8. Earnings per share**

Earnings per share increased in the first six months of 2017 by A 0.13 to A 1.45 compared to the same
period of the previous year (1-6/2016: A1.32).

**3. Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet**

**3.1. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets decreased by A 24.5 million to A 1,557.9 million as of June 30, 2017 (December 31, 2016:
A 1,582.4 million). This development was attributable to currency effects as well as write-downs. As of
June 30, 2017, intangible assets included goodwill in the amount of A 405.6 million (December 31, 2016:
A 404.6 million).

**3.2. Property, plant and equipment**

As of June 30, 2017, property, plant and equipment increased to A 345.6 million (December 31, 2016:
A 322.7 million). The increase was primarily attributable to investments in production facilities in the
Serbian subgroup as well as reclassifications of former non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
in accordance with IFRS 5.

**NOTES (Continued)**

**3. Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Continued)**

**3.3. Inventories**

Inventories increased to A 539.4 million as of June 30, 2017 (1-6/2016: A 484.9 million). This development
was particularly attributable to reclassifications of former non-current assets and disposal groups held for
sale in accordance with IFRS 5, as well as additions from the acquisition of the Serbian wholesaler
Velexfarm.

**3.4. Other financial assets**

Current other financial assets decreased to A29.3 million as of June 30, 2017 (December 31, 2016:
A39.9 million). This development was mainly attributable to the expiration of a derivative financial
instrument.

**3.5. Other assets**

The increase in current other assets by A 16.9 million to A 45.6 million as of the reporting date of June 30,
2017 (December 31, 2016: A 28.7 million) was particularly due to advance payments made.

**3.6. Retained earnings and other reserves**

Retained earnings including net income comprise net income for the first six months of 2017 as well as
earnings generated in previous periods, provided these were not distributed, including amounts transferred
to retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized
through other comprehensive income are reported under this item, taking deferred taxes into account.

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are reported in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve. The decrease in other provisions in the first six months of 2017 can
be allocated primarily to the depreciation of the Russian ruble and British pound sterling since
December 31, 2016 and the resulting expenses with no effect on income from the currency translation of
companies accounted for in this currency.

**3.7. Financial liabilities**

As of June 30, 2017, the Group’s current and non-current financial liabilities in the amount of
A 443.9 million and A 987.8 million (December 31, 2016: A 134.3 million and A 1,336.4 million) particularly
include promissory note loans that have a nominal value in the amount of A 665.0 million (December 31,
2016: A 709.0 million), a bond with a nominal value in the amount of A 350.0 million and a bond with a
nominal value in the amount of A 300.0 million (December 31, 2016: a bond with a nominal value in the
amount of A 350.0 million and a bond with a nominal value in the amount of A 300.0 million). The increase
in non-current financial liabilities primarily resulted from the reclassification of a bond in accordance with
its maturity. In addition, promissory note loans in the amount of A 44.0 million were repaid in the first six
months of 2017.

**3.8. Trade accounts payable**

Trade accounts payable increased as of the balance sheet date of June 30, 2017 by A 11.9 million to
A 348.7 million (December 31, 2016: A 336.8 million). This development was particularly a result of the
acquisition of the Serbian wholesaler Velexfarm, as well as reclassifications of former non-current assets
and disposal groups held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.

**3.9. Other financial liabilities**

Current other financial liabilities decreased by A 50.8 million to A 163.2 million as of June 30, 2017
(December 31, 2016: A 214.0 million), primarily as a result of declining accruals for health insurance
organization discounts.

**3.10. Other liabilities**

Current other liabilities decreased by A 23.7 million to A 95.2 million as of June 30, 2017 (December 31,
2016: A 118.9 million), primarily due to declining accruals for personnel-related liabilities in Germany.

**3.11. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and related liabilities**

As of June 30, 2017 there was no recognition of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
(December 31, 2016: A 83.0 million) as well as related liabilities (December 31, 2016: A 14.6 million) in a
separate line item. On December 31, 2016, this related to reported disposal groups for two subsidiaries.
The subsidiary STADA Import/Export International Ltd. was sold in the first quarter of 2017. The sale of
the second subsidiary is no longer considered highly likely as a result of current strategic considerations.

The following table includes a reclassification based on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of December 31,
2016 for comparison, which only shows the STADA Import/Export International Ltd. subsidiary as
recognized as held for sale. In this Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, non-current
assets and disposal groups held for sale in the amount of A 3.8 million as well as related liabilities in the
amount of A 0.8 million are reported, which consequently relate exclusively to STADA Import/ Export
International Ltd. that was sold in the first quarter of 2017.

**4. Notes to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement**

**4.1. Cash flow from operating activities**

Cash flow from operating activities, which consists of changes in items not covered by investments,
financing, exchange differences on the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in foreign
currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement, decreased to A 89.5 million
in the first six months of 2017 (1-6/2016: A 113.0 million). The change of A 23.5 million compared with the
same period of the previous year is particularly due to a significantly higher cash-effective increase in
inventories in the reporting period, as well as a cash-effective increase in trade accounts receivable
compared with a cash-effective decrease in the previous year, which was particularly attributable to a lower
increase in the factoring volume in the reporting period compared with the same period of the previous
year. An improved gross cash flow compared with the previous year as well as a lower cash-effective
decrease in trade accounts payable partially compensated for these reduction effects on cash flow from
operating activities.

**4.2. Cash flow from investing activities**

Cash flow from investing activities—which reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the
inflows from disposals—amounted to A �73.2 million in the reporting period (1-6/2016: A �98.1 million).
In the first six months of 2017, the cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by
payments for investments in intangible assets. Within the scope of business combinations, there were
pay-outs for the final purchase price payment from the acquisition of the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier
as well as for the acquisition of the Serbian pharmaceutical wholesaler Velexfarm. In the corresponding
period of the previous year, there were significantly higher pay-outs for business combinations, mainly for
the acquisition of the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier and the British BSMW. Proceeds from the disposal
of shares in consolidated companies exclusively related to the sale of shares in the Chinese STADA
Import/Export International Ltd., Hong Kong. The sale price amounted to A 6,000 and was paid in cash
and cash equivalents. Assets in the total amount of A 1.7 million and liabilities in the total amount of
A 1.7 million were hereby disposed of.

**4. Notes to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement (Continued)**

**4.3. Cash flow from financing activities**

Cash flow from financing activities amounted to A �44.1 million in the reporting period
(1-6/2016: A 229.3 million). This development was primarily attributable to a significantly lower borrowing
of funds compared with the same period of the previous year.

**4.4. Cash flow for the period**

Cash flow for the period is the balance of cash inflows and outflows from cash flow from operating
activities, cash flow from investing and financing activities as well as from changes in cash and cash
equivalents due to exchange rates and/or the scope of consolidation and amounted to A �31.8 million in
the first six months of 2017 (1-6/2016: A 242.3 million).

**5. Segment Reporting**

**5.1. General information**

The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting
methods used in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Services between the segments are charged
based on market prices.

The reported segment result corresponds to the operating profit of the Income Statement of the STADA
Group in accordance with IFRS. Reporting of individual non-current assets according to segment as well
as segment liabilities is waived, as this information is not used for Group monitoring.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, STADA reviews the allocation to the
respective hierarchy levels according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If the
need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the
reporting period.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FAHfT) and derivative financial liabilities (FLHfT) include positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (interest rate/currency swaps and foreign exchange
swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards were calculated using
financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as
spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous
year, these fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties. This
continued to be the case for interest/currency swaps in the reporting year. This includes the application of
discounted cash flow methods, which are largely based on input parameters observable in the market. The
cash flows which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve are discounted to the
measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the balance
sheet date. The same applies for the calculation of the fair values of the derivative financial liabilities with
a hedging relationship in the previous year, which reflected the negative market values of the interest rate
swaps used as hedging instruments.

As STADA utilizes pricing information from external third parties without further correction in the
determination of the fair value, and therefore does not produce any quantitative, non-observable input
factors, the option of IFRS 13 to waive the disclosure of quantitative information on such input factors is
taken.

**NOTES (Continued)**

**7. Disclosures about fair value measurements and financial instruments (Continued)**

The following disclosures are made for financial assets and financial liabilities whose fair value differs from
the carrying amount as of June 30, 2017:

**Carrying amount** **Fair Value** **Carrying amount** **Fair Value**
**in E 000s** **June 30, 2017** **June 30, 2017** **Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2016**

Financial liabilities shown in the table are allocated to the valuation category ‘‘Financial liabilities
measured at amortized cost’’ in accordance with IAS 39. There have been no changes regarding the
division of financial assets and financial liabilities into valuation categories in accordance with IAS 39 in
the first six months of 2017 as compared to the presentation in the Annual Report 2016.

For all other financial assets and liabilities not displayed in the table above, the carrying amounts—
approximately or based on valuation methods taking the listed prices on active markets or observable input
parameters in the market as a basis—correspond to the respective fair values of the individual assets and
liabilities.

**8. Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations with respect to third parties resulting from past events
and which may lead to a future outflow of resources depending on specific events. As of the balance sheet
date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are therefore not recognized.

Along with contingent liabilities described in the Annual Report 2016, in the first six months of 2017, there
were also additional potential liabilities of A 12.8 million. This increase was primarily due to an outstanding
assessment of the tax treatment of trading conditions as well as possible liabilities due to a ban on business
activities between Russia and Ukraine. The revision of the assessment of a patent risk for an active
pharmaceutical ingredient resulting in a reduction in contingent liabilities of A 3.3 million had an opposing
effect.

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there were other future financial obligations, which can be broken
down as follows:

**in E 000s** **June 30, 2017** **Dec. 31, 2016**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62,776 69,111
Other financial obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49,797 42,460

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **112,573** **111,571**

As of June 30, 2017, other financial obligations primarily included a guarantee amounting to A 25.0 million
toward Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, in connection with a supply agreement between Hospira
and the shares in the associated company BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which are recognized using
the equity method.

STADA, as guarantor, has continued to recognize this guarantee as a financial guarantee in accordance
with IAS 39 with a fair value in the amount of only A 0.3 million in the reporting period (December 31,
2016: A 0.3 million), as STADA is currently not expecting utilization of this guarantee.

Furthermore, additional guarantees assumed by the STADA Group are included in other financial
liabilities, among other things.

**9. Related party transactions**

In the scope of the ordinary course of business, STADA Arzneimittel AG and/or its consolidated
companies have entered into related party transactions. In accordance with IAS 24, ‘‘related parties’’ refers

**9. Related party transactions (Continued)**

to directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries that are not consolidated due to lack of material
significance, associates and joint ventures as well as persons in key positions and their close relatives. In
principle, all trades are settled with related companies and natural persons at market-rate conditions.

No significant changes occurred with regard to related companies in the first six months of 2017 compared
with the situation as described in the Annual Report 2016.

No significant changes occurred with regard to related parties in the first six months of 2017 compared
with the situation as described in the Annual Report 2016.

**10. Significant events after the balance-sheet date**

At the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, changes were made to the STADA Executive Board. At its
meeting of July 4, 2017, the STADA Supervisory Board consented to Dr. Wiedenfels resigning from office
as Chairman and member of the Executive Board and to Mr. Kraft resigning from office as a member of
the Executive Board.[(1)] Both resigned from office with immediate effect. At the same time, the Supervisory
Board appointed Mr. Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink as a member and Chairman of the Executive Board
and Dr. Bernhard D¨uttmann as a member of the Executive Board as Chief Financial Officer. Both of the
new Executive Board members were appointed with immediate effect and for a period up to December 31,
2017.

reporting as adopted by the EU, and of the group interim management report in accordance with the
requirements of the WpHG applicable to interim group management reports, is the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements and on the Group Interim Management Report based on our review.

We conducted our review of the condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and of the Group
Interim Management Report in accordance with the German generally accepted standards for the review
of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the review such that we can preclude through critical evaluation, with a certain
level of assurance, that the condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have not been prepared,
in material respects, in accordance with those IFRS applicable to interim financial reporting as adopted by
the EU, and that the Group Interim Management Report has not been prepared, in material aspects, in
accordance with the requirements of the WpHG applicable to interim group management reports. A
review is limited primarily to inquiries of company employees and analytical assessments and therefore
does not provide the assurance attainable in a financial statement audit. Since, in accordance with our
engagement, we have not performed a financial statement audit, we cannot issue an auditor’s report.

Based on our review, no matters have come to our attention that cause us to presume that the condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance
with those IFRS applicable to interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU, or that the Group Interim
Management Report has not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance with the requirements of
the WpHG applicable to interim group management reports.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**General Information**

**1. Corporate information**

STADA Arzneimittel Aktiengesellschaft (STADA Arzneimittel AG) as the parent company of the STADA
Group (hereafter referred to as ‘‘STADA’’), based at Stadastrasse 2–18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is an
internationally-oriented company based in Germany and active throughout the world in the health care
and pharmaceuticals markets, especially in the Generics and Branded Products segments.

The consolidated financial statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2016 were approved
for publication by the Executive Board on March 27, 2017.

**2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements prepared for STADA Arzneimittel AG as parent company as of
December 31, 2016, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union
(EU), as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a(1) of the
German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The separate financial statements of the companies
included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same reporting date as the consolidated
financial statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their maturities.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
notes are shown in euro thousands (A 000s). Rounding is necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2016, STADA observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to
pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which were first applicable as of
January 1, 2016. The changes had no or no significant effect on the presentation of STADA’s net assets,
financial position and results of operations.

**The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB. Adoption into**
**European law in accordance with IFRS 16 is still pending:**

In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and
includes guidelines for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments. Furthermore,
IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be applied for
financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. An examination of
the impact of the application of IFRS 9 on the consolidated financial statements has not yet been
completed. As a result of the new guidelines for the impairment of financial instruments, in some cases
expected future losses may lead to earlier recognition of expenses.

In May 2014, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular
replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. An
examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 15 on the consolidated financial statements has not
yet been completed. However, the new standard on the realization of sales will have little impact on sales
accounting, as sales are largely realized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of routine
transactions. There are no agreements in the Group which regulate multiple services within one contract

or within several contracts (multi-element arrangements). Changes may occur exclusively in the accounting
of licensing agreements, which amounted to less than 2% of the total sales revenue in financial year 2016.
However, this only affects license agreements which are not bound by the sales achieved by the licensee
and which grant the licensee the right to use the license, without further actions by STADA being required.
For such license agreements, as a result of the new IFRS 15 standard, in future sales will be realized in the
amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore not, as they are presently,
divided over the term of the license.

In January 2016, the IASB published the new IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ standard, which determines the
recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (financial liabilities) associated with leases in the
balance sheet for lessees. Lessees are no longer required to classify leases as finance leases or operating
leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier
application is permitted. An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the consolidated
financial statements has not yet been completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the
lessee’s balance sheet, as required by IFRS 16, an increase of the balance sheet total is expected at the
point of initial application. Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of the changes from IFRS 16, future
depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a
corresponding positive impact on EBITDA.

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected
from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

With the exception of the changed accounting policies listed in Note 3., there were no changes to
accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of STADA’s net assets, financial
position and results of operations or cash flow in financial year 2016.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated financial
statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by STADA and are
therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if STADA Arzneimittel AG or its subsidiaries are in control of
an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to
substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of
voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the consolidated
financial statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which STADA is able to exercise significant influence and which are not
subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity
method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net
assets, financial position and results of operations situation of the STADA Group is immaterial, are not
consolidated or accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for
either at fair value or at amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet
total of these companies make up about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and

The acquisition of the Argentinian company Laboratorio Vannier S.A. was completed in accordance with
corporate law in the first quarter of 2016. The initial consolidation of the company as a subsidiary occurred
on January 1, 2016. In addition, the acquisition of the British company BSMW Limited was completed in
accordance with corporate law and was consolidated as a subsidiary for the first time as of February 1,
2016.

Furthermore, the Finnish company Oy STADA Pharma Ab was deconsolidated in the second quarter of
2016 as a result of the completed liquidation.

In addition, the Egyptian company STADA Egypt Ltd. was deconsolidated due to liquidation initiated in
the third quarter of 2016.

Furthermore, the British company Natures Aid was included in the scope of consolidation as a result of the
acquisition in accordance with corporate law. The initial consolidation was on November 21, 2016.

In the consolidated financial statements of the STADA Group, 84 companies were consolidated as
subsidiaries and four companies as associates as of the reporting date on December 31, 2016.

As in the previous year, the aforementioned chart includes BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which is
included in the consolidated financial statements as an associate according to the equity method. STADA
holds 15.86% of the shares in this company. The significant influence is therefore not directly due to the
amount of shares held, but instead is a result of STADA’s representation in the supervisory body of
BIOCEUTICALS as well as distribution rights granted for Epo-zeta in Germany through cell pharm
Gesellschaft f¨ur pharmazeutische Pr¨aparate mbH and the associated significant business transactions.

As in the previous year, the aforementioned chart also includes both French companies Pharm Ortho
Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS, pursuant to shareholdings of 25.0% and 20.0% acquired by STADA, which
are included in the consolidated financial statements as an associate in accordance with the equity method.
The initial inclusion of the Russian Dialogfarma LLC as an associate took place as of August 1, 2015. The
following condensed financial information is given for these four associates:

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the
historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the
acquiree, STADA recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the
period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a
revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares
of non-controlling interests are reported in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity
investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables and financial liabilities, expenses and income, as
well as earnings between the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are eliminated,
intragroup value allowances and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in
deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax
liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at historical cost on the date when joint
control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associate) and carried
forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A
positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the

F-38

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (Continued)**

carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the
period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is
recognized in the consolidated financial statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IAS 39 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of STADA Arzneimittel AG is the euro and represents the reporting currency of
the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every reporting date, monetary items are translated using the closing rate
and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

The translation of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements with a functional
currency other than the euro into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and also the resulting
translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different foreign exchange rates are recognized
through other comprehensive income in the equity in the ‘‘reserves for currency translation’’. These
reserves are released and recognized in income if Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

The exchange rate development of currencies important to STADA to the euro can be seen in the
following chart:

**Closing rate on Dec. 31 in local**

Sales generated in the Branded Products segment with the Socialites group amounted to around
A 10.1 million in financial year 2016. The operating profit of this business combination adjusted for the
effects of the purchase price allocation (around A 1.9 million) amounted to around A 0.8 million in the
reporting year.

In order to strengthen the Generics segment, STADA and the STADA subsidiary BEPHA
Beteiligungsgesellschaft f¨ur Pharmawerte mbH signed a contract for the purchase of the Argentinian
generics producer Laboratorio Vannier in the fourth quarter of 2015. The purchase price amounted to
USD 13.0 million (according to the foreign exchange rate at the date of acquisition approx. A 11.9 million)
and was or will be paid in cash or cash equivalents. This includes certain conditional purchase price
components, which are to be paid upon reaching a fixed earnings figure. This is guaranteed to reach a
minimum of USD 1 million, with a maximum of USD 1.5 million. The seller was a private individual. The
purchase was completed in the first quarter of 2016. STADA achieved control on January 4, 2016.

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the evaluation of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

Sales generated in the Branded Products segment with BSMW amounted to around A 3.9 million in the
eleven months since the initial consolidation. The operating profit of this business combination adjusted
for the effects of the purchase price allocation (around A 0.2 million) amounted to around A 2.1 million in
the reporting year. If STADA had acquired BSMW on January 1, 2016, sales of around A 4.2 million and
operating profit, adjusted for effects from the purchase price allocation (around A 0.2 million), of around
A 2.3 million would have been achieved on a straight-line basis in 2016.

In the third quarter of 2016, the Serbian subsidiary of STADA Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm A.D., acquired
a local product portfolio that primarily includes drugs for treating inflammations of the gastrointestinal
tract, including the related processes.

The purchase price for the acquisition of the product portfolio including the associated sales structure
amounted to a total of A 21.6 million and will be or has already been completely paid in cash or cash
equivalents. The acquisition includes a portfolio of 50 product presentations for the sales in Serbia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro, the corresponding IP rights and license agreements and
a local production and packaging facilities. In addition, Hemofarm will take over 104 employees. STADA
achieved control upon conclusion of the contract on August 1, 2016, as a result of which the acquired
business has been consolidated within the STADA Group since August 1, 2016.

In the context of the final purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of A 0.4 million resulted from
this business combination and was broken down as follows:

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the evaluation of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

The acquired sales amounted to approx. A 3.5 million in the five months after initial consolidation. The
operating profit of this business combination adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation
(around A 0.7 million) amounted to around A 1.5 million in the reporting year. If STADA had acquired the
Serbian product portfolio on January 1, 2016, sales of around A 8.4 million and operating profit, adjusted
for effects from the purchase price allocation (around A 1.7 million), of around A 3.6 million would have
been achieved on a straight-line basis in 2016.

During the negotiations with the seller of the rights for the product portfolio, Hemofarm A.D. acquired
inventories for a purchase price of A 1.9 million in May 2016. This will be settled entirely in cash. The

corresponding obligation was recognized as trade payables. Since the acquisition date, the acquired
inventories have been billed to third-party customers.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, STADA acquired the British Natures Aid, based in Preston. STADA
achieved control upon conclusion of the contract on November 21, 2016. The purchase price for the
acquisition amounted to GBP 16.8 million and was completely paid in cash or cash equivalents.

In the context of the final purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of A 4.7 million resulted from
this business combination and was broken down as follows:

could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the evaluation of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

Sales generated in the Branded Products segment with Natures Aid amounted to around A 1.2 million in
the first month and a half of 2016 since the initial consolidation. The operating profit of this business
combination adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (around A 0.2 million) amounted to
around A 0.3 million in the reporting year. If STADA had acquired British branded product company on
January 1, 2016, sales of around A 9.9 million and operating profit, adjusted for effects from the purchase
price allocation (around A 1.4 million), of around A 2.0 million would have been achieved on a straight-line
basis in 2016.

As part of the negotiations with the seller of the company, parallel to the agreed merger, Natures Aid
acquired the building belonging to the production location and the site at a purchase GBP 1.7 million. The
purchase price was fully paid by the company in cash and cash equivalents.

The Serbian subsidiary of STADA Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm A.D., acquired Serbian pharamaceutical
wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o. Beograd, based in Belgrade, Serbia, to strengthen the business activities on the
Serbian market. The acquisition was completed with the aim of vertical integration in the Serbian market.
The purchase price for the acquisition will total a maximum of A 1.0 million and will be or has already been
fully paid in cash or cash equivalents. The purchase was completed on January 6, 2017 after the
competition authorities approved the purchase contract signed in October 2016. The purchase price
allocation is not yet finalized. In financial year 2016, the company achieved sales of A 33.6 million and a

**8. Business combinations (Continued)**

profit of approximately A 0.1 million. Total assets amounted to approximately A 30.2 million at the end of
financial year 2016, which primarily related to the net current assets. Business relationships with Serbian
Hemofarm A.D. had already existed before the acquisition. In financial year 2016, these sales amounted to
A 8.9 million.

**9. Accounting policies**

STADA’s consolidated financial statements are based on uniform financial reporting policies. The basis for
these are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the consolidated
financial statements and which are described in more detail below.

**Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered, provided that it is probable**
that measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to the buyer. It must also be possible to reliably measure the Company’s
own costs incurred or to be incurred.

Sales are recognized before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions (rebates or discounts) at fair
value of the consideration received or receivable. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties
are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience
regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined
as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction
on sales based on the respective contract in force.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally accounted in the same period. Expenses
related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to commercial goods (e.g. cost
of materials and personnel expenses), overheads (e.g. depreciation of production equipment and
regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as valuation allowances of excess or obsolete inventories.

**Research expenses are costs that are incurred in relation to the research activity of a company that aims to**
provide new scientific or technical findings. The product portfolio of the STADA Group continues to focus
on products that do not require the Group to conduct its own research. As in previous years, no research
expenses were incurred in financial year 2016.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process at STADA is to obtain national or multinational
regulatory drug approval. Development costs relative to approvals for new drugs obtained by STADA
result in capitalization as intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory drug approval), enabling
it to become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use or
sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It must be possible to reliably determine the development costs of the intangible asset.

STADA immediately recognizes development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense in the periods
in which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
marketed.

**Interest income is reported in the income statement as a component of financial income. In this regard, both**
interest income and interest expenses for all financial instruments measured at amortized cost as well as
interest-bearing financial assets classified as available for sale are recognized on the basis of the effective
interest rate.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

Dividends received from companies not included in the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
within the investment income. This shall be recognized when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is
established.

**Income taxes include actual taxes on income as well as deferred tax liabilities. The tax receivables and**
liabilities recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and
outside Germany from financial year 2016 as well as from previous years, if applicable. The tax receivables
and liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the reporting date or known and
already concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable profit is generated.

Deferred tax liabilities are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities
and their valuation rate in the IFRS financial statements as well as for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will result against which the
temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences
taxable in the future. STADA determines deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the
reporting date or those that have already been resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax
receivables and liabilities are offset if these relate to the same taxation authority.

The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that
are recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with
an effect on deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to one of the two operating
segments of the STADA Group for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill.

STADA carries out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also
take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount
of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in
use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order to
determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions,
investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made
individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on
internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the recoverable
amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the
carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups
are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of
these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. At STADA, this affects the umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in the context of the acquisition

F-45

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

of the Hemofarm group, the umbrella brand Pymepharco capitalized in the context of achieving control
over Pymepharco, and the umbrella brand Vannier capitlalized in the context of the acquisition of
Laboratorio Vannier. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through
annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether
the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized according the criteria of IAS 38. Capitalized development costs
consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in
development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overheads. Internally created
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life, generally 20 years.

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives must be depreciated separately, is not applied at STADA due to a lack of
relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are
reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset and property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original historical
costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, STADA assesses whether
indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for two operating segments with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are reported under ‘‘Other expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units within the STADA Group are defined at the level of individual assets within the
reportable segments of Branded Products and Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Leases are classified either as operating leases or as finance leases, depending on whether the significant**
risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor or with the lessee. The lease is not recognized in the
lessee’s balance sheet in case of operating leases. STADA records the lease payments for these leases
through profit or loss over the lease term. Assets from finance leases are, on initial recognition, recognized
at the lower of the fair value of the lease and the present value of minimum lease payments, and are
depreciated according to their estimated useful lives or shorter contractual period. An amount is reported
as lease liability, when, on initial recognition, it corresponds to the lease’s carrying amount and is
extinguished and carried forward in subsequent periods with a constant effective interest rate. The interest
that is part of the lease installment is recognized as an expense.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

In addition, in case of sale and leaseback transactions that represent a finance lease, any surplus of sales
proceeds over the carrying amount is deferred and recognized in the income statement over the lease term.

The total value of capitalized leases is not of material significance for STADA when compared with the
total volume of fixed assets.

Under **financial assets, STADA recognizes shares in non-consolidated, affiliated companies and other**
investments. Shares in associated companies and other investments are classified as available-for-sale
financial assets and are generally reported at fair value with no effect on income. If no quoted market
prices in an active market are available to measure these shares and their fair value therefore cannot be
determined reliably, they are measured at amortized cost. If any objective indications of impairment are
determined, these are quantified by means of an impairment test and recognized in income in accordance
with IAS 39.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods)**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at
the lower of historical costs or costs of sales and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of sales are
determined based on weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in
production and overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable
depreciation on production facilities. Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an
expense in the period in which they occur. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the
sale.

**Financial assets can be broken down into the following categories in accordance with IAS 39: Loans and**
receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and
held-to-maturity investments. Financial assets are accounted for and measured pursuant to IAS 39.
Accordingly, financial assets are, as a rule, initially recognized at fair value. In addition, for financial assets
that are subsequently measured at amortized cost, transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition
are to be taken into account. Different measurement policies apply for subsequent measurement in
accordance with the applicable categories for financial assets pursuant to IAS 39.

**Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not**
quoted in an active market. They are allocated to current assets to the extent that they are due for
settlement within twelve months after the reporting date. STADA reports loans and receivables under
‘‘Trade accounts receivable’’, ‘‘Other financial assets’’ and ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’. They are
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

STADA reports receivables from derivatives which, if applicable, may also be part of hedge accounting, as
**financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Assets in this category are reported under the ‘‘Other**
financial assets’’ item. They are measured at fair value. If these assets do not have a quoted market price in
an active market, fair value is determined with appropriate measurement models. This includes the
application of discounted cash flow methods. These are largely based on input parameters observable in
the market. Changes in the fair values are recognized in income at the time of the increase or impairment
in value.

**Held-to-maturity financial investments include non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments**
and a fixed term that STADA intends to hold to maturity. They are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. STADA reports these assets in financial assets under the item ‘‘Other financial
assets’’.

**Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative assets that are not allocated to any of the above**
categories. In particular, they comprise, in addition to shares in affiliated companies and other investments
included in financial assets, equity securities and are recognized under ‘‘Other financial assets’’. They are
measured at fair value, with changes reported under ‘‘Provisions available for sale’’ directly in equity with
no effect on profit or loss. These measurement results are reclassified through profit and loss upon sale or
valuation allowance of these assets. There must be objective evidence that there is a significant or
continuing decrease in fair value below historical cost. Published market price quotations usually can be
used for determining fair value.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the
expected default risk, STADA determines the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by
debtor. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of
receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to
be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces
the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are classified as held for sale, if the related carrying**
amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and if
the sale is regarded as highly probable. Measurement of these assets is based on the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell. In addition to assets held of sale, associated liabilities are also
reported separately in the balance sheet.

**Cash and cash equivalents include cash and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid financial**
investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. These can be converted to cash
immediately and are subject only to minor price fluctuation risks. They are measured at amortized cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are reported in accordance with their definition as financial resources in IAS 7.

Other assets, which are not based on any contractual rights involving the direct or indirect exchange of
cash, are reported under the item Other assets.

STADA maintains defined benefit plans in various countries, according to which the amount of pension
benefits depends on the employees’ pensionable remuneration and the length of their service or which
contain guarantees not permitting recognition as defined contribution plan. **Pension obligations are**
measured in accordance with actuarial principles using the projected unit credit method. The pension
provisions recognized in the balance sheet correspond to the present value of the defined benefit
obligation on the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets adjusted for the effect resulting from
any effect of limiting the benefit asset. In addition to earned pensions and entitlements, the calculation
also includes future salary and pension increases. For German Group companies, pension obligations are
calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. Outside
Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual
pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality
corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market
in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government
bonds.

The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized with no effect on income. It
differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions, due to changes in
financial assumptions as well as due to experience-based amendments. They are recognized directly in
equity with no effect on income in the period in which they occur (‘‘other comprehensive income, OCI’’).
The relevant amounts are reported separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For
the calculation of the portion of the interest income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, the
standard IAS 19 requires the application of the discount rate underlying the obligation. The remainder of
the actual income from plan assets is to be recognized directly in other comprehensive income with no
effect on profit or loss. The current service cost is recognized in staff costs of the individual functional
areas. All past service cost that arises in the financial year shall be recognized immediately through profit
or loss.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans
are recognized as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas.

The **other non-current provisions contain anniversary provisions as other long-term employee benefits.**
Commitments to anniversary payments are accounted in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 as other
long-term employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not
recognized without an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately
reported as income or expenditure in the relevant functional area. Furthermore, there is a working time
accounts plan that is accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.

**Other provisions are made by STADA if there are current legal or constructive obligations to third parties**
arising from past events that will probably lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
that can be reliably determined. An outflow of assets embodying economic benefits is considered as
probable if it is more likely than not. Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into
account all recognizable risks, offers the best possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the
obligations. Any existing reimbursement claims by third parties are not netted with other provisions.
Expenses from the creation of provisions are allocated to functional costs according to where they arise. If
changes in estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other provisions are reversed on a pro rata
basis and recognized through profit and loss under the item where the original expense was recognized.

STADA reports all other provisions as current financial liabilities because a settlement date within twelve
months of the reporting date is expected. The amounts recognized are not discounted. Liabilities incurred
due to outstanding accounts or obligations to personnel and taxation authorities, as well as other liabilities
are not reported as provisions, but under ‘‘Trade payable’’ or ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

Differentiated from provisions, there are contingent liabilities for possible obligations based on past events
but which will not become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not under
STADA’s control. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for which
however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the obligation
cannot be adequately estimated. In accordance with IAS 37, such contingent liabilities are not recognized.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values that are not part of an
effective hedging relationship and allocated to the category ‘‘at fair value through profit or loss’’ in
accordance with IAS 39. STADA reports these financial liabilities in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item.
Here, those derivative financial instruments are also included which serve to hedge interest rate and
currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments, and which are also
measured at fair value in accordance with the regulations of IAS 39 on hedge accounting. Unless market
prices are available, fair value is determined with measurement models based on discounted cash flow
models.

**Derivative financial instruments exist at STADA in the context of derivatives measured at fair value through**
profit or loss as well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. In each case, depending on
whether the market value of the derivatives is positive or negative, they are recognized under the item
‘‘Other financial assets’’ or ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ (see financial reporting policies for financial assets
and financial liabilities). Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging instruments in the context of hedge accounting
in accordance with IAS 39.

At STADA, cash flow hedges are used to hedge against fluctuations of cash flows associated with an
accounted asset or an accounted financial liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the
fair value of these hedging instruments are recognized with no effect on income in the amount of the
effective part of the hedging relationship directly in equity under ‘‘Provisions for cash flow hedges’’. A
transfer to the income statement takes place in the period when the underlying hedged item becomes
effective. The ineffective part of the changes in value is, however, recognized directly in the income
statement.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of accounted assets or accounted
liabilities or fixed off balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions
are recorded in profit and loss like changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. If the
requirements for hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously hedged items
are adjusted on the basis of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign operation are
treated according to the same accounting policies as cash flow hedges.

STADA regularly reviews the effectiveness of the hedging relationships as a prerequisite for hedge
accounting pursuant to IAS 39. A hedging relationship is in general considered to be effective, if changes
in fair value of the hedging transaction are both prospectively and retrospectively within a range of 80% to
125% of the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item.

STADA measures all other financial liabilities, in particular trade payable as well as financial liabilities, at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

STADA has so far not made use of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as
financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

Other financial liabilities, which are not based on any contractual rights involving the direct or indirect
exchange of cash, are reported under the item ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

At STADA, share-based payments are used as long-term oriented remuneration components in the context
of performance-related remuneration of Executive Board members and are paid in cash. These payments
are recognized at the fair value of the liability in accordance with IFRS 2. Until the liability is settled, the
fair value of the liability is to be reclassified on each reporting date and on the settlement date, and all
changes in the fair value are to be recognized through profit and loss. STADA uses the Monte Carlo model
to determine the fair value of share-based payments. The fair value of share-based payments to the
Executive Board from deferrals are recognized under the item ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated Group
financial statement is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, STADA
makes estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other
factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and
assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual
circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting
issues concerned are detailed below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

STADA carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain
assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine
the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning
period of three years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year detailed planning
horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed.
The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable
future legal developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters
determined in the context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the
assessment of impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the
reporting year an impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or

F-50

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ credit-worthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction.
In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred tax liabilities in the Group, the expected
income tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain balance
sheet item according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined
on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a
corresponding effect on current and deferred taxes and thus on the net assets, financial position and results
of operations of the Group in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the
STADA Group is being allotted to a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the renumeration of
intragroup services. Possible risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes are limited
by the introduction of appropriate communication methods and an overarching definition of transfer
pricing in the form of a Group guideline.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension costs.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and
a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success of these methods. The
determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due
to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for warranties may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

Sales at STADA primarily resulted from the supply of products and, to a much lesser extent, from license
revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please refer to details included in Financial Reporting
Policies.

In 2016, the increase in sales compared to 2015 was primarily based on strong sales development in the
markets Germany, Italy and Vietnam. This development was primarily attributable to the strong growth in
the German Branded Products segment as well as the sales increase in the two core segments in the Italian
and Vietnamese markets. Exchange rate effects and portfolio changes had a total influence of
A 28.0 million on sales in the reporting year. For information on how sales are broken down according to
segments, please refer to the ‘‘Segment reporting’’ in Note 42.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in E 000s** **2016** **2015**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 883,480 874,066
Impairment, depreciation and amortization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100,976 101,497
Expenses from inventory write-downs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28,207 36,545
Remaining cost of sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 92,650 89,601

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,105,313** **1,101,709**

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A 101.0 million (previous year:
A 101.5 million) mainly includes amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a
necessary condition for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value offset with
reversals. The reversals amounted to A 7.7 million in financial year 2016 (previous year: A 7.2 million).

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and sales force, selling expenses also comprise the costs for
advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics
that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts
in kind,—if possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not included. The resulting
expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing expenses in the amount of A 210.4 million (previous year: A 210.0 million)
corresponded to a share of 43% in selling expenses (previous year: 44%). In addition, selling expenses
included depreciation in the amount of A 6.9 million (previous year: A 7.1 million).

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2016, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A 7.0 million
(previous year: A 7.9 million).

General and administrative expenses increased in the reporting year by a total of A 4.3 million. The
increase primarily resulted from the subsidiaries consolidated for the first time in the reporting year or at
the end of the previous year.

**15. Research and development costs**

For information on the composition of research and development costs, please refer to the details included
in Financial Reporting Policies.

F-52


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**15. Research and development costs (Continued)**

In financial year 2016, research and development costs increased by A 0.1 million compared to the previous
year.

The research and development costs include depreciation in the amount of A 2.3 million (previous year:
A 2.1 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A 28.4 million (previous year:
A 26.1 million) were capitalized in financial year 2016 (see the note on the item ‘‘Intangible assets’’).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

**in E 000s** **2016** **2015**

Income from write-ups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 —
Income from disposals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 2,317
Remaining other income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19,276 17,715

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **19,279** **20,032**

The remaining other income includes a milestone payment received in the Branded Products segment in
the United Kingdom, income from insurance compensation, income from damage claims payments as well
as other other income not directly associated with functional costs that comprise many immaterial
individual items in the Group companies.

Furthermore, the income from disposals mainly resulted from the deconsolidation of the French subsidiary
Laboratoires d’´etudes et de recherches en oligo ´el´ements th´erapie SA in the previous year.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

**in E 000s** **2016** **2015**

Expenses from valuation allowances on accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,972 9,367
Currency translation expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,379 19,549
Impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65,480 32,790
Impairment losses on goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 410
Remaining other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58,102 21,593

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **138,933** **83,709**

Expenses for valuation allowances on accounts receivable were reported offset with the corresponding
income from their reversal.

Other expenses include impairment losses in the amount of A 65.5 million (previous year: A 32.8 million)
that exclusively relate to impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill in the reporting year.
In the previous year, impairments to goodwill resulted from an impairment for the Asia/Pacific & MENA
region. The increase in comparison with the previous year was primarily due to reorganization decisions in
connection with the adapted corporate strategy. These impairment losses were considered by STADA as a
special item of financial year 2016.

The item also included net currency translation expenses in the amount of A 9.4 million in the reporting
year (previous year: A 19.5 million). This development was particularly attributable to the strong
devaluation of the major currencies in the CIS region and the resulting currency translation expenses,
reported as special items.

Within remaining other expenses, personnel expenses are recognized in the amount of A 24.8 million
(previous year: A 4.4 million). The increase in comparison with the same period of the previous year was
particularly due to a severance payment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board as well as further
personnel expenses in connection with the merging of the German sales companies. Furthermore,

F-53


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**17. Other expenses (Continued)**

remaining other expenses also increased due to the termination of a distribution agreement with the
Belgian sales partner OMEGA and the associated damage claim payment.

The item other expenses includes expenses in the amount of A 21.6 million in connection with the
termination of substantial parts of the aesthetics business. These expenses particularly resulted from
impairments to intangible assets, impairments to financial assets, a payment for the termination of the
distribution agreement, the reduction in inventories, outstanding rental payments and severance payments.

**18. Financial result**

The **result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2016 relates to the companies**
BIOCEUTICALS Arznei-mittel AG, Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS as well as
Dialogfarma LLC since last year, and are accounted for using the equity method.

**Investment income primarily relates to profit distributions from companies not included in the consolidated**
financial statements.

**Financial income and financial expenses are composed of the interest result and other financial income and**
other financial expenses.

The interest result developed as follows:

**in E 000s** **2016** **2015**

Interest income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,716 1,142

- Financial liabilities measured at amortized costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �39,120 �46,349

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2016 includes an interest expense from other non-current
provisions, which comprises interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from pension
obligations and other non-current provisions, in the amount of A 1.1 million (previous year: A 1.0 million).

In financial year 2016, the Group refinanced itself at interest rates of between 0.7% p.a. and 26.0% p.a.
(previous year: between 0.7% p.a. and 16.6% p.a.). On the reporting date of December 31, 2016, the
weighted average interest rate for non-current financial liabilities was approx. 1.66% p.a. (previous year:
approx. 2.0% p.a.) and for current financial liabilities approx. 3.12% p.a. (previous year: approx.
5.1% p.a.). For all of the Group’s financial liabilities the weighted average interest amounted to approx.
1.78% p.a. (previous year: approx. 2.6% p.a.).

Interest payments partially resulting from interest rate swaps designated by STADA as hedging
instruments in cash flow hedges are not netted for each swap contract and are recognized as interest
income or interest expense in the valuation category of the associated underlying hedged item. For the
reporting year, this exclusively concerns financial liabilities which were valued at amortized costs.

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A 1.4 million in financial
year 2016 (previous year: A 1.0 million). A capitalization rate of 2.0% for intangible assets (previous year:
2.3%) was taken as a basis.

The result from the measurement of financial instruments in the reporting year resulted from interest rate
swaps and interest rate/currency swaps measured at fair value through profit or loss. There was a net
burden on earnings in the amount of A 0.5 million before or A 0.4 million after taxes. In the previous year,
there was a net burden on earnings from the measurement of derivative financial instruments in the
amount of A 3.1 million before and A 3.1 million after taxes. The measurement of interest rate hedge
transactions depends on the development of the money market interest rate.

The result from the disposal of financial instruments was due to the early utilization of interest rate swaps
in financial year 2016.

**19. Income taxes**

The item income taxes includes taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as
well as deferred tax liabilities. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to the sales,
administration or research and development functions are included in other expenses.

Actual income taxes can be divided according to timing as follows:

The effective income tax rate amounted to 25.1% for financial year 2016. The effective income tax rate in
the previous year was 25.8%. The nominal income tax rate amounted to 28.3% in financial year 2016 for
STADA Arzneimittel AG in Germany, this includes corporation tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the
solidarity surcharge in the amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 357%. In
the previous year, the nominal income tax rate of STADA Arzneimittel AG amounted to 27.4%. The
difference resulted from the increase in the assessment rate for corporation tax of 27 percentage points in
Bad Vilbel.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement
was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes. The

Deviations in the local tax rate primarily resulted from lower nominal tax rates in the United Kingdom.

Tax effects from loss carryforwards primarily resulted from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards for
which no deferred tax assets have been reccognized so far.

The effects from tax rate changes in the previous year primarily resulted from a decrease in the tax rate in
the United Kingdom and the associated remeasurement of deferred taxes.

Deferred tax liabilities reported by STADA resulted, among other things, from deferred taxes in the
context of purchase price allocations carried out under IFRS 3. The reduction in deferred tax liabilities
compared with the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization on intangible assets with
purchase price allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as a decrease in the tax rate in the
United Kingdom and the associated remeasurement of deferred taxes.

Tax advantages that are highly probable and expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards
are reported under ‘‘Tax loss carryforwards’’.

Tax loss carryforwards are only capitalized if their future utilization is highly probable. Tax loss
carryforwards capitalized as of the December 31, 2016 reporting date amounted to A 30.9 million in
financial year 2016 (previous year: A 73.2 million).

Income taxes decreased by a total of A 6.1 million (previous year: Increase of income tax expense by
A 6.6 million) through the utilization of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards from previous years
for which no deferred taxes have been recognized so far and through tax loss carryforwards from the
current financial year for which no deferred taxes have been recognized.

The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to
their expiry date:

outstanding.

(1) On August 26, 2016, the STADA Annual General Meeting resolved to eliminate restrictions on the transferability of registered
shares by means of a change to the Articles of Incorporation. The change to the Articles Incorporation was entered in the
commericial register on December 9, 2016 and took effect on this date. The authorization of the approved capital in accordance
with Section 6 (1) of the Articles of Incorporate therefore no longer refers to registered shares with restricted transferability.

**Personnel expenses (in** E million) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **365.7** **342.7**

The average number of employees in the reporting year was above the level of the previous year at 10,839
(previous year: 10,441). The most substantial reasons for the increase in the number of employees in
financial year 2016 include the consolidation of the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier S.A. the acquisition
of the British company BMSW Limited and Natures Aid Limited, as well as the acquisition of a local
product portfolio, the Serbian IVANCIC I SINOVI I DOO with a total of 218 employees. On the reporting
date, the STADA Group’s number of employees in 2016 totaled 10,923 (previous year: 10,532).

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their
functional relevance, increased in financial year 2016 to A 365.7 million (previous year: A 342.7 million).
The increase was primarily attributable to expenses from reorganization decisions and structural measures
resulting from a changed coporate structure.

**23. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are included in expenses of the individual functional
areas according to their functional relevance and can be attributed to intangible assets, property, plant and

The impairment of intangible assets concerns various drug approvals and trademarks.

Impairments of financial assets recorded in the financial year particularly resulted from the termination of
further parts of the aesthetics business. The impairments in the previous year primarily related to the
carrying amounts of Hetmak FZCO in Dubai.

Depreciation and amortization decreased by 1.2% as compared to the previous year. More information on
amortization, depreciation and impairment losses is included in the Notes on non-current assets.

Additions from business combinations according to IFRS 3, which are based on fair values determined as
part of the purchase price allocation, primarily relate to A 18.8 million from the acquisition of a Serbian
product portfolio to strengthen the position in the consumer healthcare area, A 11.5 million from the
purchase of the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier S.A. and A 3.5 million and A 17.4 million from the
acquisitions of the British BSMW Limited and Natures Aid Limited.

In the reporting year, reclassifications of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale relate to two
subsidiaries in Asia.

The umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the Hemofarm
group is included in recognized trademarks as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as STADA
intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2016, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount
of A 37.4 million (previous year: A 45.4 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31,
2016, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 13.2% were used. There was a necessity for impairment
for the reporting year in the amount of A 7.4 million. In addition, the change compared to the previous year
figure of A 0.6 million is a result of different foreign exchange rates.

Furthermore, in the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in 2013, the umbrella brand
Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as STADA
intends to continue to use the trademark. As of December 31, 2016, it has a carrying amount of
A 9.7 million (previous year: A 9.5 million). The change is a result of different foreign exchange rates. In the

context of the impairment test of December 31, 2016, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 13.8%
were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

As part of the acquisition of Laboratorio Vannier in the reporting year, the umbrella brand Vannier was
capitalized as an intangible asset with a carrying amount of A 0.3 million and an indefinite useful life as a
trademark as STADA inteds to continue to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2016, it has a carrying
amount of A 0.3 million. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2016, a royalty rate of 2%
and a discount rate of 21.9% were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2016 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A 1.4 million (previous year: A 1.0 million). In financial year
2016, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
2.0% (previous year: 2.3%).

Development costs of A 31.0 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A 27.5 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life, generally 20 years. STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization as expense in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year 2016,
these development costs amounted to A 65.1 million (previous year: A 65.0 million).

Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is
recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an
amount of A 83.5 million (previous year: A 84.4 million).

In financial year 2016, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A 61.8 million (previous year: A 32.9 million). No valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the
reporting year. In the previous year, this related to valuation allowances on goodwill for market region
Asia/Pacific & MENA in the amount of A 0.4 million.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation
(see Note 5.).

In accordance with the fundamental change to reporting structures in the third quarter of 2016 agreed by
the Executive Board, the STADA Group no longer reports by segments and market regions, but by
operating segments, i.e. the two segments Generics and Branded Products. This measure is in line with the
growth strategy, including central management of the segements, an increasing internationalization of the
product portfolio as well as a stricter cost control and is first applied in the reporting and planning process
as part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. In the course of the change, the non-core activity
Commercial Business was integrated into the Generics segment.

**24. Intangible assets (Continued)**

In the course of converting the internal reporting and the associated aggregation of cash-generating units,
an impairment test was carried out on June 30, 2016 based on the cash-generating units from the previous
year due to an indication of a possible impairment. No necessity for impairment was identified.

In the previous year, the capitalized goodwill for cash-generating units was as follows:

**Residual carrying amount as of Dec. 31, 2015**
**in E million**

Generics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 187.8

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **391.6**

In comparison with the previous year[(1)], there were the following significant changes in the carrying
amounts of goodwill:

- The increase in goodwill in the cash-generating unit Branded Products was primarily attributable to
the finalizing of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of the British company Natures Aid

In the context of the regular impairment tests for capitalized goodwill of September 30, 2016, the
discounted cash flow method is used to determine anticipated cash inflows, applying the following
parameters defined for the individual cash-generating units according to segment:

**Growth rates**
**of the**
**forward-project**
**According to segment, defined as** **phase 2016** **WACCs 2016**
**cash-generating unit** **in %** **in %**

Generics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4% 10.3%
Branded Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.7% 10.0%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and medium-term market
developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth
rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for
the determination of the value in use is based on assumptions in light of past experience, supplemented by
current internal developments and verified through external market data and analyses. The most important
assumptions include the development of future selling prices, amounts and costs, the influence of the
regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth rates. Significant
changes to the above-described assumptions would influence the determination of the value in use of the
cash-generating units. The discount rates applied are determined on the basis of external factors derived
from the market and adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the cash-generating units.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the different cash-generating
units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage
points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no
necessity for an impairment to any cash-generating unit.

(1) It should be noted here that as a result of the redefinition of the cash-generating units in financial year 2016, the results of the
impairment test in financial year 2015 are not comparable with those of financial year 2016.

Financial assets are primarily the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated investments which
are entirely measured at amortized cost for lack of available market prices. There is currently no intention
to sell these financial assets. Held-to-maturity financial investments were included under other financial
assets. The impairment of financial assets recorded in the reporting year resulted in particular from the
termination of substantial parts of the aesthetics business.

**31. Inventories**

Inventories can be subdivided as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2015**

Materials and supplies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 93,156 97,992

In financial year 2016, impairments offset with reversals were made on the net realizable value of
inventories in the amount of A 28.2 million (previous year: A 36.5 million), which were already deducted
from the amounts shown above through profit and loss. In financial year 2016, reversals here amounted to
A 7.7 million (previous year: A 7.2 million).

**32. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subjected to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the
respective national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash
equivalents amount to A 2.3 million (previous year: A 2.3 million) and, as in the previous year, exclusively
relate to cash and cash equivalents in China.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents from A 143.2 million as of December 31, 2015 to A 352.6 million
as of December 31, 2016 is primarily due to reporting date effects. Further details on the development of
cash and cash equivalents can be found in the consolidated cash flow statement.

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated debts**

As of December 31, 2016, assets in the amount of A 83.0 million and liabilities in the amount of
A 14.6 million held for sale in the context of a disposal group were reported in a separate line item in the
balance sheet. The disposal group relates to two subsidiaries STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd., Ho-Chi-Minh

As the carrying amount of the disposal group was below fair value less disposal costs as of December 31,
2016, no impairment expense was recorded.

**34. Equity**

Group equity amounted to A 1,047.1 million as of the reporting date (previous year: A 1,018.5 million). This
corresponds to an equity-to-assets ratio of 30.4% (previous year: 31.0%).

**34.1. Share Capital**

As of December 31, 2016, share capital amounted to A 162,090,344.00 (December 31, 2015:
A 162,090,344.00) and was divided into 62,342,440 registered shares (December 31, 2015: 62,342,440), each
with an arithmetical share of share capital of A 2.60 per share, and is fully paid. Each share grants one vote
in the Annual General Meeting.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**34. Equity (Continued)**

As of December 31, 2016, authorized share capital and conditional capital were comprised as follows:

**Amount in** E **Shares** **Purpose**

Authorized capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . 77,134,304.00 29,667,040 Increase of share capital (until
June 4, 2018)

Conditional Capital 2013 . . . . . . . . 69,188,340.00 26,610,900 Settlement of options and/or
conversion rights (until June 4,
2018) in connection with issued
bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds, participation
rights and/or participating bonds in
the total nominal amount of up to
A 1.0 billion, or in the scope of a
guarantee assumed for bonds with
warrants and/or convertible bonds,
participation rights and/or
participating bonds issued by
subordinate Group companies

**34.2. Capital reserve**

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and particularly include the capital reserve of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Differences from the capital
reserve determined according to the provisions of German commercial law primarily result from the
recognition at their market value of the shares of STADA Arzneimittel AG newly issued in 2003 as well as
the associated treatment of issuing costs, which were deducted from the capital reserve.

Changes in the capital reserve were solely the result of the change in treasury shares in fiancial year 2016.
In the previous year the increase of capital reserve in particular resulted from STADA warrants 2000/2015
in the context of the exercise of options, which expired at the end of June 26, 2015.

**34.3. Retained earnings including net income**

Retained earnings including net income comprise net income for the financial year as well as earnings
generated in previous periods, provided these were not distributed, including amounts transferred to
retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized
through other comprehensive income are reported under this item, taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2016, net income in the
amount of A 4.8 million after deferred taxes—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling
interests—resulted from the remeasurement. It is mainly based on the reduction of discount rate on which
the remeasurement is based for various defined benefit plans in the STADA Group underlying the
measurement of December 31, 2016 in comparison with December 31, 2015.

**34.4. Other reserves**

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are reported in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve. The reserve ‘‘available for sale’’ and the reserve for cash flow
hedges include the results from the measurement at fair value of financial instruments categorized as
available for sale, and the measurement results from cash flow hedges from the effective portion of the
hedge, allowing for respective deferred taxes.

The reduction of other reserves compared with the previous year is primarily composed of the following
opposing effects: On the one hand, the devaluation of the British pound sterling since December 31, 2015
led to expenses recognized directly in equity from the currency translation of financial statements of

**34. Equity (Continued)**

companies reporting in British pound sterling. On the other hand, the appreciation of the Russian ruble
since December 31, 2015 has resulted in income recognized in equity from the currency translations of
financial statements of companies reporting in the respective currency, which only partially compensated
for the previously described expenses.

**34.5. Treasury shares**

As of the reporting date, the Company held 85,043 treasury shares (previous year: 87,259), each with an
arithmetical par value of A 2.60 per share, which is equivalent to 0.14% (previous year: 0.14%) of the share
capital. In financial year 2016, 2,216 treasury shares were sold at an average price of A 36.31 per share
within the scope of an employee share ownership plan.

**34.6. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares of non-controlling shareholders relate to minority interests of other shareholders in the subsidiaries
STADA Thailand, STADA Import/Export International, STADA Vietnam, Pymepharco, STADA
Pharmaceuticals (Beijing), Well Light Investment Services, Hemomont and Hemofarm Banja Luka.

**35. Other non-current provisions**

Other non-current provisions made by STADA as of the reporting date in Germany and outside Germany
include pension provisions and other non-current provisions in the form of anniversary provisions and
provisions for working time accounts as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2015**

Germany . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,157 11,464

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among others, insurances, government bonds and securities funds.

In financial year 2016, the plan assets of one international subsidiary exceeded their pension obligations,
with the result that these assets in excess were reported under other assets as assets from overfunded
pension plans in the amount of A 0.02 million (previous year: A 0.1 million including Germany).

Plan assets were divided according to investment type as follows:

**Share of plan assets**

settlements relate to positive effects from the acquisition of retirement benefits from old contracts as well
as, to a lesser extent, to principle payment benefits in Ireland.

Reclassifications carried out in the reporting year in the amount of A 0.5 million relate to two Asian
subsidiaries, the pension obligations for which were reclassified as liabilities associated with current assets
and disposal groups held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. Furthermore, one plan was removed from the
scope of consolidation due to the deconsolidation of the company STADA Egypt and reported under the
corresponding disposals.

The income from plan assets amounted to A 7.3 million in financial year 2016 (previous year: expense of
A 2.2 million) for German group companies and A 9.0 million for international group companies (previous
year: expense of A 0.1 million). The increase in plan assets for German Group companies is mainly due to
an increase of the plan assets of an approval to the level of the gross obligation as a result of existing
reinsurance; this is a consequence of a decreased measurement rate in financial year 2016. The increase in
the plan assets abroad particularly results from an increase in the plan assets in the United Kingdom and
the Netherlands.

The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and
pension costs:

The increase in the salary trend is due to the fact that the last active plan participant in a pension plan will
receive a pension from 2017 and this pension plan will no longer have a negative influence on the average
salary trend.

As of December 31, 2016, the weighted duration of the pension obligations amounts to 20 years (previous
year: 21 years) for German Group companies and 17 years (previous year: 17 years) for international
Group companies.

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan, are expected in the amount of A 0.7 million for German Group companies and
A 3.6 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the
company. For the STADA Group, retirement benefit plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 83%. Accordingly, the
following details focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG), in which the minimum legal requirements for company pension plans
are embedded. Regulation and legal pre cedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement

**35. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees.
Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension.

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2016, plan assets amounted to A 44.4 million and were composed of
three different plans. There are no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally.
Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development and the risk that the real
future salary development exceeds the salary development derived from assumptions taken in the
evaluation.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board was transferred to a pension
fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability
of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and
recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to
offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the
pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future.

Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that
the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands
is, in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned
requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement
or early death.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan is partially financed via contributions to an insurance company.
Assets received by the insurance company cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The
assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the
amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2016, plan assets amounted to A 26.9 million.

The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest
rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of
investing the proceeds. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the
contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should
change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future
proceeds received.

Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law for example specifies that former
employees have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If
the evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the
insurance, the company could be required to pay an additional contribution payment.

In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees with defined benefit plans that are concluded for
new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator and are monitored by trustees who
determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required
pension plan funding and ensuring sufficient assets to cover the technical provision of the plan. The
pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and participant life expectancy as well as
inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low, the level of
funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in
plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only
compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

In the long-term, 40% of the plan assets in the United Kingdom should be invested in so-called matching
assets, which guarantee the fulfillment of future pension obligations under changing market conditions. In
accordance with target allocation, the remaining 60% should be invested in so-called growth assets, for
which an above-average rate of return is expected in comparison with the obligation development. As of
December 31, 2016, plan assets amounted to A 23.3 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an
active market.

In Switzerland, all employers must offer their employees a pension plan according to federal pension law
(Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option.

The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in
the relevant functional areas, amounted to A 23.2 million in financial year 2016 (previous year:
A 22.4 million).

**36. Financial liabilities (Continued)**

The increase in financial liabilities was attributable to the securing of additional promissory note loans in
the total amount of A 350.0 million, which will be used for the financing of the promissory note loans,
which expired in financial year 2016 in the total amount of A 188.0 million.

The contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows, as of the reporting date December 31, 2016, from
interest payments and repayment of financial liabilities for the coming years can be seen in the following
table:

For the financial liabilities existing as of the reporting date, a repayment in accordance with the maturity
disclosed in the balance sheet was generally assumed. For current liabilities due to banks, an extension of
existing credit lines was partly assumed. The variable interest payments from the promissory note loans
were determined based on the interest rate last fixed before December 31, 2016.

Internal measures to ensure the necessary liquidity for repayment of financial liabilities are detailed in the
Notes on the capital management of liquidity risk (see Note 46.5.).

**37. Trade payables**

Of the total amount of trade payables, A 0.0 million (previous year: A 0.0 million) are due after one year.

The change in trade payables primarily resulted from effects related to the reporting date, especially
relating to deferrals for outstanding invoices. Furthermore, financial year 2016 saw an increase in
comparison to the previous year resulting from business combinations reported in accordance with IFRS 3.

As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding purchase price liabilities were primarily attributable to
outstanding contingent consideration for the acquisition of Argentinean company Laboratorio Vannier and
product acquisitions in Italy and the United Kingdom.

As of December 31, 2015 the outstanding purchase price liabilities had mainly comprised amounts from
the acquisition of the British Socialites group and various products in the United Kingdom, which were not
yet due.

Finance lease liabilities, such as for vehicles and passenger vehicles, amount to A 3.3 million (previous year:
A 2.2 million). Considering interest in the amount of A 0.6 million (previous year: A 0.3 million), lease
installments payable in subsequent years total A 3.9 million (previous year: A 2.5 million). The lease
liabilities are due as follows:

In addition, the negative market values of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss were
reported in liabilities from derivative financial instruments. In financial year 2016, this related to crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards (see Note 45.1.). Within the scope of the maturity date analysis, the
following contractually agreed remaining terms result for these derivative financial liabilities:

Remaining financial liabilities include liabilities from discount agreements of German STADA companies
in the amount of A 166.3 million (previous year: A 178.3 million) and furthermore comprise many
insignificant individual items in the Group companies. The remaining financial liabilities fall due in the
amount of A 197.2 million (previous year: A 215.2 million) within one year, in the amount of A 0.1 million
after one year and up to five years.

Among other things, other liabilities include the share-based Executive Board remuneration from
deferrals, which is calculated at fair value. Until the liability is settled, the fair value is to be calculated at
each financial statement reporting date and at the date of settlement, and the changes in current fair
values are to be recognized in the income statement through profit or loss.

In addition, personnel-related liabilities increased primarily due to reorganizational decisions and
structural measures resulting from a changed corporate structure.

Remaining liabilities comprise many insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

**Other Disclosures**

**41. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by investments, financing,
exchange differences on the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in foreign currencies
or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from operating activities
improved to A 333.5 million in the reporting year (previous year: A 311.7 million). The increase in cash flow
from operating activities of A 21.8 million compared to the previous year is primarily due to a
comparatively significantly lower cash-effective increase of inventories and a cash-effective increase in
trade accounts payable, although in the previous year a significant cash-effective decrease was recorded
here. This positive effect on cash flow from operating activities was partly compensated by cash flows from
other net assets that were significantly higher than the previous year.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from
disposals. It amounted to A �172.7 million in the reporting year (previous year: A �178.2 million).

In financial year 2016, payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A 76.1 million
(previous year: A 81.4 mil-lion) were made, of which A 33.4 million (previous year: A 32.3 million) related to
significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio.
Acquisition-related sales growth was generally associated with these investments in the reporting year.
Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A 11.0 million (previous year: A 11.8 million)
in the financial year.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**41. Notes to the cash flow statement (Continued)**

The cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by payments for investments in
intangible assets in the financial year 2016, primarily relating to advance payments made for the
development of approvals, trademarks and licence acquisitions in Germany and the United Kingdom.
Furthermore, payments were also made for business contributions, in particular from the purchase of a
product portfolio in Serbia, as well as the purchase of the British Natures Aid and the Argentinean
Laboratorio Vannier.

Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A 55.2 million in financial year 2016 (previous
year: A �155.1 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend
distribution payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. This
development was primarily attributable to the securing of additional promissory note loans in the total
amount of A 350.0 million, which will be used for the refinancing of the promissory note loans expiring in
financial year 2016 in the total amount of A 188.0 million. In addition, significantly fewer financial liabilities
were repaid in the reporting year than in the previous year.

Dividend distribution payments of A 43.6 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders
of STADA Arznei-mittel AG for financial year 2015.

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities
amounted to A 160.9 million in financial year 2016 (previous year: A 133.5 million) and is therefore still
significantly characterized by a high volume of acquisitions.

Free cash flow, adjusted for effects from payments for significant investments and acquisitions and effects
of proceeds from significant disposals is calculated as follows:

**42. Segment Reporting**

The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting
methods used in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Services between the segments are charged
based on market prices.

Segmentation within the STADA Group is based on sales differentiation. Thus, the allocation to the
individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for
parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reclassified.

In the previous year, STADA aggregated business segments into the reportable segments of Generics and
Branded Products, because the type of products, the sales methods and the regulatory framework
conditions are largely comparable. According to the new reporting structure, which was introduced in the
third quarter, the Group is now only managed by operating segment, i.e. according to the two segments
Generics and Branded Products. This measure is primarily designed to take account of the growth strategy
including central management of the segments, increasing internationalization of the Branded product
portfolio as well as stricter cost control. As part of the changes to the reporting structures over the course
of the current financial year, the non-core Commercial Business segment was integrated into the Generics
segment. Therefore, the figures reported for the Generics segment for financial year 2016 as well as those
for the previous year include the non-core activity Commercial Business, which was previously disclosed
separately.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**42. Segment Reporting (Continued)**

Generics are products for the health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or
several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning
complies with one of the two following criteria:

- The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another
supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient,

or

- the product is an integral part of a marketing concept targeting more than one product and indication
for primarily prescription products with active ingredients whose commercial property rights have
expired,

or

- the product is sold under its international non-proprietary name (INN).

Branded Products are products for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients
whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two
following criteria:

- The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products,

or

- the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly
sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products.

All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be directly allocated to the segments, as well as the
elimination of sales between segments are recognized under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and
consolidation.

Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not,
however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In
addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance
organization billings are included here. Reporting of the segment liabilities and non-current segment assets
is waived, as this is without relevance for Group monitoring and for Group reporting.

In the presentation of sales by the company’s business premises, sales to third parties are shown according
to the invoicing company’s registered office of the countries listed.

Disclosures on assets by country relate to parts of the non-current assets (intangible assets, property, plant
and equipment).

**42.5. Information about major customers**

In accordance with IFRS 8.34, a company must provide notification when sales revenues from business
activities from a single external customer amount to at least 10% of the company’s total sales revenues. As
in the previous year, this related to no customer in the reporting year.

**43. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations with respect to third parties which result from past
events and which may lead to a future outflow of resources depending on specific events. As of the balance
sheet date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are therefore not accounted.

STADA has contingent liabilities, among other things, in connection with patent risks for certain active
pharmaceutical ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The resulting possible
obligations amounted to approx. A 12.9 million (previous year: A 12.4 million). The development compared
with the previous year was primarily attributable to the elimination of possible liabilities in the amount of
A 5.1 million, but also possible liabilities in the amount of A 4.5 million being recognized. Furthermore, a
changed estimation relating to the high imminent outflow of resources for patent risks, which existed in the
previous year, led to a further increase of contingent liabilities in the amount of A 1.1 million.

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under
50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**44. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there were other future financial obligations, which can be broken
down as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2015**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69,111 81,288

Liabilities from operating leases relate particularly to IT equipment and vehicles. In addition, there are
liabilities from long-term rental agreements for office buildings with an average contract term of four
years.

The total of future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to A 69.1 million as of the
end of the financial year (previous year: A 81.3 million) and can be broken down according to remaining
term as follows:

**Operating leases**
**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2015**

Remaining terms up to 1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28,673 32,151

Lease payments in the amount of A 32.4 million (previous year: A 30.5 million) were recognized as an
expense in financial year 2016.

There is still a guarantee amounting to A 25.0 million towards Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, in
connection with a supply agreement between Hospira and the shares in the associate BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG which are recognized under the equity method.

STADA, as guarantor, has continued to recognize this guarantee as a financial guarantee in accordance
with IAS 39 with a fair value in the amount of A 0.3 million in the reporting year (previous
year: A 0.3 million). Utilization of this guarantee granted is currently not expected.

Furthermore, additional guarantees assumed by the STADA Group are included in other financial
liabilities, among other things.

**45. Disclosures about financial instruments (Continued)**

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade receivables mainly have short remaining terms, their
carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to the fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of
promissory note loans, bonds, as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the
current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the fair values.

Available-for-sale financial assets are primarily the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated
investments which are entirely measured at amortized cost for lack of available market prices.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables as well as of held-to-maturity financial investments with
remaining terms of more than a year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade payables as well as remaining financial liabilities
also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair values.

For the disclosures according to class of financial instrument necessary in accordance with IFRS 7, STADA
defines each valuation category as a class.

The table below shows how the valuation rates of financial instruments measured at fair value were
determined for the respective classes of financial instruments:

**Level 2** **Level 3**
**Valuation methods** **Valuation methods**
**with input** **with input**
**Level 1** **parameters** **parameters**

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, STADA reviews the allocation to the
respective hierarchy levels according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If the
need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the
reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy
levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FAHfT) and derivative financial liabilities (FLHfT) include positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (interest rate/currency swaps and foreign exchange
swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards were calculated using
financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as
spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous
year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties. This
continued to apply for interest rate/currency swaps in the year under review. This includes the application
of discounted cash flow methods, which are largely based on input parameters observable in the market.
The cash flows which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve are discounted to
the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the
balance sheet date. The same applies for the calculation of the fair values of the derivative financial

liabilities with a hedging relationship, which reflect the negative market values of the interest rate swaps in
the previous year used as hedging instruments.

As STADA utilizes pricing information from external third parties without further correction in the
determination of the fair value, and therefore does not produce any quantitative, non-observable input
factors, the option of IFRS 13 to waive the disclosure of quantitative information on such input factors is
taken.

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result. Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from interest rate/currency swaps and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value through
profit or loss, which are reported under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the
currency translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other
income or other expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to currency swaps
expired in financial year 2016 and the partial fulfillment of cross-currency swaps.

Valuation results from financial assets held for sale and cash flow hedges, which are reported under other
comprehensive income in equity, are not included in this presentation as they had no effect on income.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**

**46.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Executive Board in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all
transactions above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Executive Board must first be approved
by the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount
of current risks.

**46.2. Currency risks**

STADA’s Group and balance sheet currency is euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, STADA is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

However, STADA is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters risks from
currency-related fluctuations, alongside natural hedges, through the use of derivative financial instruments,
which are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In
the reporting year, STADA made use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest / currency swaps.
The maturity dates of futures contracts are thereby selected to match the Company’s anticipated cash
flows. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year.

In the context of consolidated financial statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to
an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of
earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro
(translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally negative
and devaluation is generally positive.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In case of hedging transactions they are compared with the positive
or negative balances from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign
currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the foreign currency item
due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% depreciation of the euro in comparison respective functional currency
are as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2015**

functional currency by 10% . . . . . . . . �2,126 +2,780 �3,089 �1,694 +1,341 �3,721
Income (+) / expense (�) from a

comparison to the respective
functional currency by 10% . . . . . . . . +2,552 �2,796 +2,669 +2,053 +2,054 +3,740

Here, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items in Kazakhstani tenge, US dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia relate to a
balance from international Group companies in euro and outstanding foreign currency reserves in
Kazakhstani tenge, US dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia. The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign
currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective, results from the functional currency of the
respective international Group company. Overall, based on outstanding foreign currency items as of the
reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the respective functional currency by 10% compared to
the currencies of relevance for the Group would have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an
expense of A 2.6 million (previous year: A 6.8 million) or in the amount of earnings of A 2.6 million
(previous year: A 6.8 million).

**46.3. Interest rate risks**

STADA is subject to interest risks from financial assets as well as financial debts, primarily in the Euro
zone and Russia.

In order to minimize the effects of significant interest rate fluctuations, STADA manages the interest rate
risk for the financial liabilities denominated in euro with hedging transactions. In financial year 2016, to
hedge the interest rate risk, there were cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps in the first six
months. Taking into account these hedging transactions, an average of 85% (previous year: 85%) of
financial liabilities denominated in euro and 100% (previous year: 100%) of those denominated in ruble
had fixed interest rates in 2016.

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

STADA calculates existing interest rate risks using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors—if relevant—are generally included in the calculation:

- changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments in
the context of cash flow hedges,

- changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are
not hedged against interest rate risks, and

- changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

**46.4. Default risks**

STADA is exposed to a default risk in its operating business or as a result of financing activities if
contracting parties fail to meet their obligations. Alongside the implementation of appropriate credit
management processes, such transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable
financial standing to avoid default risks in financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. STADA therefore strives to maintain
business relations only with partners of impeccable financial standing. In addition, STADA partly uses
suitable measures such as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard itself against
default risk. Overdue receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored and potential default
risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation adjustments. In addition, there is the risk that in a
difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments
to STADA or business partners of STADA and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks
arise.

STADA’s maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amounts of the financial assets
accounted. In addition, STADA granted guarantees, which amounted to a total nominal volume of
A 25.3 million (previous year: A 25.3 million) as of the reporting date (see Note 44.). STADA has various
forms of collateral for credit securities such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of
receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets
and customers.

**46.5. Liquidity risks**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of
the liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of the STADA Group at all times by
way of maintaining a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves and having free credit lines. STADA finances
itself with short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring.
Furthermore, STADA has solid operating cash flow and further bilateral credit contracts with various
banks (credit lines), which can be utilized as needed.

**46.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

STADA counters risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are
exclusively used to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial
transactions and investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation
purposes.

In financial year 2016, there are cash flow hedges exclusively in the form of payer interest rate swaps in the
first six months. Here, variable interest payments were transformed into fixed interest payments and the
cash flow risk of variable interest liabilities is thus hedged. In the context of these hedging relationships,
interest rate related cash flow changes of the hedged items are netted with cash flow changes of interest
rate swaps.

In financial year 2016, no new payer interest-rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in order to
secure interest payments from promissory note loans. The payer interest rate swap, accounted in the
previous year, has expired in the current reporting year.

The total volume of currency and interest rate related derivatives is comprised as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2016** **Dec. 31, 2015**
**Nominal** **Nominal**
**in E 000s** **value** **Fair Value** **value** **Fair Value**

All of the above hedging relationships presented above were effective until expiration. All changes in the
fair value of the derivative hedging instruments were therefore recognized directly in equity under
‘‘Provisions for cash flow hedges’’ with no effect on profit or loss. In financial year 2016, the resulting
earnings amounted to A 0.9 million after consideration of deferred taxes (previous year: A 1.1 million).

**46.7. Disclosures on capital management**

The objectives of the STADA capital management are the safeguarding of the business operation, the
creation of a solid equity base for financing profitable growth as well as guaranteeing attractive dividend
payments and the capital service. The STADA capital management consistently aims for the Group
companies to have an equity basis that corresponds to the local requirements. When implementing and
checking the Group’s capital and liquidity the legal requirements are taken into account.

Capital is monitored on the basis of net debt, which results from current and non-current financial
liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents as well as available-for-sale securities. An important key figure
for capital management at STADA is the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which amounted to 2.8 in
financial year 2016 (previous year: 3.1).

**47. Related party transactions**

In the scope of the ordinary course of business, STADA Arzneimittel AG and/or its consolidated
companies have entered into related party transactions. In accordance with IAS 24, ‘‘related parties’’ refers
to directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries that are not consolidated due to lack of material
significance, associates and joint ventures as well as persons in key positions and their close relatives. In
principle, all trades are settled with related companies and natural persons at market-rate conditions.

**47.1. Transactions with related persons**

Persons in key positions are the members of governing bodies of STADA Arzneimittel AG, the
remuneration of whom, including further information on the principles of the remuneration system, is
presented in detail in the Group Management Report (see ‘‘Remuneration Report’’), as well as the
summary in Note 47. in relation to quantitative disclosures.

In the course of their normal professional activities, individual members of the Supervisory and Advisory
Boards who are self-employed have business relations with STADA. These are not significant in regards to
volume and nature.

In view of the fact that Steffen Retzlaff, the son of former Chairman of the Executive Board Hartmut
Retzlaff, focuses on his responsibilities as Senior Vice President of the region Asia/Pacific & MENA, his
other mandates—with the exception of his position as member of the Board of Directors of STADA
MENA DWC-LLC and STADA Pharmaceuticals (Asia) Ltd.—ended in June 2016.

**AUDITOR’S REPORT**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by STADA Arzneimittel
Aktiengesellschaft, Bad Vilbel, comprising the balance sheet, the income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, the cash flow statement and the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, together with the group management report for the business year from
January 1 to December 31, 2016. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315a Abs. (paragraph) 1 HGB (‘‘Handelsgesetzbuch’’: German
Commercial Code) are the responsibility of the legal representatives of the company. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and on the group management report
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and
German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of net assets, financial
position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with
reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit
procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting related internal control system and the evidence
supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are
examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit.

The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the
determination of the entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements and the group management report.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the consolidated financial statements comply with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
§ 315a Abs. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with the legal requirements and as a whole
provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future
development.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**General Information**

**1. Corporate information**

STADA Arzneimittel Aktiengesellschaft (STADA Arzneimittel AG) as parent company of the STADA
Group (hereafter referred to as ‘‘STADA’’), based at Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is an
internationally oriented company based in Germany, which is active worldwide in the health care and
pharmaceuticals market, especially in the core segments of Generics and Branded Products.

The consolidated financial statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2015 were approved
for publication by the Executive Board on March 21, 2016.

**2. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements prepared for STADA Arzneimittel AG as parent company as of
December 31, 2015, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International
Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union (EU), as well as
in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial
Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies
included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the consolidated financial
statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their maturities.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
notes are shown in euro thousands (A 000s). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2015, STADA has implemented the following change from the pronouncements and
amendments to pronouncements of the IASB published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which were
first applicable as of January 1, 2015, which did not have any significant impact on the presentation of the
business, financial and earnings situation or cash flow of STADA:

- **Amendments in the course of the ‘‘Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle’’:**

IFRS 8 ‘‘Operating Segments’’: If business segments are aggregated to reportable segments, the
judgments made by management for the identification of the reportable segments shall be disclosed.
Furthermore, there was a clarification that a reconciliation of segment assets to the amounts
recognized in the balance sheet shall only be carried out if this information is regularly reported to the
chief operating decision maker.

**The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB. The adoption**
**into European law is still pending:**

In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and
includes guidelines for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments. Furthermore,
IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be applied for
financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. An examination of
the impact of the application of IFRS 9 on the consolidated financial statements has not yet been
completed. As a result of the new guidelines for the impairment of financial instruments, in some cases
expected future losses can lead to earlier recognition of expenses.

In May 2014, IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs the revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular

F-108

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued)**

replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. An
examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 15 on the consolidated financial statements has not
yet been completed. Impacts are possible for the measurement dates of revenue in connection with
licensing agreements.

In January 2016, the IASB published the new IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ standard, which determines the recording
of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (liabilities) associated with leases in the balance sheet for
lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating leases. IFRS 16 is to
be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. An
examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the consolidated financial statements has not
yet been completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet, as
required by IFRS 16, an increase of the balance sheet total is expected at the point of initial application.
Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of amendments to IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization
and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on
the EBITDA.

From today’s perspective no or no significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected
from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

With the exception of the changed accounting policies listed in Note 3., there were no changes to
accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of STADA’s business, financial and
earnings situation or cash flow in financial year 2015.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies are included in the consolidated
financial statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by STADA and
are therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if STADA Arzneimittel AG or its subsidiaries are in control
of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to
substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of
voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the consolidated
financial statements using the equity method.

Associated companies are companies over which STADA is able to exercise significant influence and which
are not subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the consolidated financial statements using the
equity method.

As of January 1, 2015, the subsidiary located in the United Arab Emirates, STADA MENA DWC-LLC,
Dubai, as well as the Egyptian subsidiary STADA Egypt Ltd., Cairo, were included in STADA’s scope of
consolidation.

In financial year 2015 there were also changes in the scope of consolidation due to the merger of the
consolidated subsidiary Hemofarm Sabac d.o.o, Sabac, Serbia, with Hemofarm A.D., Vrsac, Serbia, also a
consolidated subsidiary.

In addition, the acquisition of the Austrian company SCIOTEC Diagnostic Technologies GmbH was
completed in accordance with corporate law in the third quarter of 2015. The initial consolidation of the
acquired company as a subsidiary occurred on September 1, 2015. The initial inclusion of the Russian
Dialogfarma LLC as an associated company took place as of August 1, 2015.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, British STADA UK Holdings, with its headquarters in Reading, United
Kingdom, was able to expand its OTC business with the acquisition of six additional companies, which
represent a business operation as defined in IFRS 3.

December 2015 saw the sale and therefore deconsolidation from the STADA scope of consolidation of the
French STADA subsidiary Laboratoires d’´etudes et de recherches en oligo ´el´ements th´erapie SA,
Boulogne-Billancourt, France.

In the consolidated interim financial statements of the STADA Group, 83 companies were thereby
consolidated as subsidiaries and four companies as associated companies as of the balance sheet date on
December 31, 2015.

As in the previous year, the aforementioned chart includes BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which is
included in the consolidated financial statements as an associated company according to the equity
method. STADA holds 15.86% of the shares in this company. The significant influence is therefore not
directly due to the amount of shares held, but instead is a result of STADA’s representation in the
supervisory body of BIOCEUTICALS as well as distribution rights granted for Epo-zeta in Germany
through cell pharm Gesellschaft f¨ur pharmazeutische Pr¨aparate mbH and the associated significant
business transactions.

As in the previous year, the aforementioned chart also includes both French companies Pharm Ortho
Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS, pursuant to shareholdings of 25.0% and 20.0% acquired by STADA, which
are included in the consolidated financial statements as associated companies in accordance with the
equity method. The initial inclusion of the Russian company Dialogfarma LLC as an associated company
took place as of August 1, 2015. The following condensed financial information is given for these four
associates:

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full—
irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the
acquisition costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the
acquiree, STADA recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the
acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a revaluation through
profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares of non-controlling
interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies**
**(Continued)**

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
directly in equity in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables and payables, expenses and income, as well as
earnings between the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are eliminated,
intercompany value adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in
deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax
liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associated companies are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the
date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established
(associated company) and carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of
earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is
recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associated company. A negative
difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associated
companies. Profit and loss from transactions with associated companies is recognized in the consolidated
financial statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IAS 39 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associated company.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of STADA Arzneimittel AG is the euro and represents the reporting currency of
the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing
rate and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

The translation of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements with a functional
currency other than the euro into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the
resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the
period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in
equity in the ‘‘Provisions for currency translation’’. These provisions are released and recognized in income
if Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

**8. Business combinations**

In financial year 2015, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for
which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in more detail below.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, STADA acquired the British company Internis Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,
London, United Kingdom, which is active in the prescription area of therapeutic treatment of vitamin D3
deficiency. STADA achieved control upon conclusion of the contract on December 19, 2014. The company
has been consolidated since this time.

The purchase price amounted to GBP 49.0 million and was completely paid in cash or cash equivalents. It
contained certain contingent purchase price components. The conditional purchase price components
amounted to a total of GBP 20.0 million and divided equally into two purchase price conditions. The first
purchase price condition was to obtain a regulatory drug approval. The final purchase price was
determined by the date of achieving the approval. The determination of the final purchase price of the
second contingent purchase price component depended on certain changes regarding competitive
parameters and determined sales targets. The amount recognized as of the acquisition date for the
conditional consideration amounted to GBP 19.8 million. Due to the achievement of the regulatory drug
approval at an early date and to unchanged competition parameters, the final purchase price amounted to
GBP 49.0 million and included conditional purchase price components in the amount of GBP 20.0 million.
The difference between the amount recognized for the conditional consideration and the final value of the
conditional purchase price components in the amount of GBP 0.2 million was recognized under other
expenses in the income statement.

In the context of the final purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of A 7.9 million resulted from
this business combination and was broken down as follows:

**in E million**

Purchase price for 100% of the shares in the company approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62.0
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 54.1

Goodwill here resulted primarily from the expansion of the presence and the sales activities in the market
region Central Europe, as well as from the takeover of a highly qualified workforce.

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the measurement of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.

Sales generated in the market region Central Europe with the company Internis Pharmaceuticals
amounted to approx. A 24 million in financial year 2015. The operating profit of this business combination
adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (approx. A 2 million) amounted to approx.
A 9 million in the reporting period.

Moreover, in financial year 2015, there was an additional significant business combination in the context of
the purchase of SCIOTEC Diagnostic Technologies, an Austrian pharmaceuticals company based in Tulln,
which is primarily specialized in the development and marketing of non-prescription (OTC) products
against enzymatic food intolerances, including relevant sales structures in order to strengthen STADA’s
branded product portfolio. The purchase price for this business was A 16.9 million.

In the context of the final purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of A 6.6 million resulted from
this business combination and was broken down as follows:

**in E million**

Purchase price for 100% of the shares of the company approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16.9
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.3
**Goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **6.6**

Goodwill thereby resulted primarily from strengthening the sales presence in the Austrian market, which
belongs to the market region Central Europe, particularly in the area of branded products and the entry
into a new field of activity.

For the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the context of the business combination, the following
fair values were recognized at the acquisition date:

**Fair values in E million**

Intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.8

**8. Business combinations (Continued)**

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the measurement of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.

Sales achieved with the company SCIOTEC Diagnostic Technologies in the market region Central Europe
have amounted to approx. A 2 million since September 1, 2015. The operating profit of this business
combination adjusted for effects from purchase price allocations (approx. A 0.2 million) amounted to
approx. A 0.2 million in the reporting period. If STADA had already purchased SCIOTEC Diagnostic
Technologies as of January 1, 2015, sales of approx. A 6 million and operating profit, adjusted for effects
from the preliminary purchase price allocation (approx. A 1 million), of approx. A 1 million would have
been achieved in 2015 assuming a linear development.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, STADA acquired the British Socialites group, based in Chesterfield. STADA
achieved control upon conclusion of the contract on December 4, 2015. The purchase price amounted to
GBP 21.0 million and will be/was completely paid in cash or cash equivalents.

In the context of a preliminary purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of A 12.2 million resulted
from this business combination and was broken down as follows:

**in E million**

Purchase price for 100% of the shares of the company approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29.5
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17.3

Goodwill thereby primarily resulted from an expansion of presence and sales activities in the Central
European market region and in the British market in particular.

The following fair values were applied at the acquisition date for the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the context of business combinations:

**Fair values in E million**

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the measurement of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.

Sales generated in the market region Central Europe with the Socialites group amounted to approx.
A 1 million in financial year 2015. The operating profit of this business combination adjusted for the effects
of the purchase price allocation (approx. A 0.0 million) amounted to approx. A 0.2 million in the reporting
period. If STADA had acquired the Socialites group on January 1, 2015, sales of approx. A 12 million and
operating profit, adjusted for effects from the purchase price allocation (around A 1 million), of approx.
A 2 million would have been achieved on linear extrapolation in 2015.

For the strengthening of the core segment Generics, STADA and STADA subsidiary BEPHA
Beteiligungsgesellschaft f¨ur Pharmawerte mbH signed a contract in the fourth quarter of 2015 to purchase
the Argentinian generics producer Laboratorio Vannier S.A., which sells its products in niches which are

subject to few price regulations, particularly in the area of CNS (conditions of the central nervous system),
cardiology and diabetes.[(1)] The purchase price amounted to USD 13.0 million (according to the exchange
rate at the date of acquisition approx. A11.9 million) and was to be paid in cash or cash equivalents. The
seller was a private individual. The purchase was completed in the first quarter of 2016. Through the
acquisition, STADA also expanded its international sales network in a country, where the Group had not
yet been represented with its own sales company.

With the goal of expanding its business activities in the area of dermatological treatments, STADA
Arzneimittel AG started a co-operation with the Austrian company CROMA-PHARMA GmbH through
its subsidiary STADA Aesthetics AG[(1)], as part of which two sales companies were acquired on January 31,
2015. The long-term cooperation relates to the existing product portfolio as well as the CROMAPHARMA product pipeline. Exclusive brand licensing rights and other distribution rights for STADA
currently apply to Germany, Belgium, Italy, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway,
Hungary, Croatia and Hong Kong. In Germany and Belgium, STADA purchased the existing sales
companies of CROMA-PHARMA with a total of five employees. It also includes the well-filled product
pipeline, with products containing the active ingredient Botulinumtoxin A, which is currently in the clinical
study phase 3 for application in cosmetic dermatology. The purchase price paid by STADA for the existing
products and the pipeline as well as the two purchased sales companies in Germany and Belgium is in the
single-digit million euro area. Once an approval of botulinum toxin A has been issued, a further payment
in the single-digit million euro range will be due.

**9. Accounting policies**

STADA’s consolidated financial statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these
are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the consolidated
financial statements and which are described in more detail below.

**Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered, provided that it is reasonably**
probable that measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that the substantial risks and
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. It must also be possible to reliably measure the
Company’s own costs incurred or to be incurred.

Sales are recognized before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions (rebates or discounts) at fair
value of the consideration received or receivable. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties
are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience
regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined
as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction
on sales based on the respective contract in force.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses
related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods
(e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead costs (e.g. depreciation of production equipment
and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value adjustments of excess or obsolete inventories.

**Research expenses are costs that are incurred in relation to the research activity of a company that aims to**
provide new scientific or technical findings. The product portfolio of the STADA Group continues to focus
on products that do not require the Group to conduct its own research. Just as in previous years, no
research expenses were thus incurred in financial year 2015.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Development expenses consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process at STADA is to obtain national or multinational
regulatory drug approval. Development costs relative to approvals for new drugs obtained by STADA
result in capitalization as intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to
become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability exist as well as the necessary resources to complete the asset and to use or
sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It must be possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

STADA immediately recognizes development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense in the periods
in which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
sold.

**Interest income is reported in the income statement as a component of financial income. In this regard, both**
interest income and interest expenses for all financial instruments measured at amortized cost as well as
interest-bearing financial assets classified as available for sale are recognized on the basis of the effective
interest rate.

Dividends received from companies not included in the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
within the investment income. This shall be recognized when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is
established.

**Income taxes include actual taxes on income as well as deferred taxes. The tax receivables and liabilities**
recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and outside
Germany from financial year 2015 as well as from previous years, if applicable. The tax receivables and
liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the balance sheet date or known and
already concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable income is generated.

Deferred taxes are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities and
their valuation rate in the IFRS financial statements as well as for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will result against which the
temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences
taxable in the future. STADA determines deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the balance
sheet date or those that have already been resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax
receivables and liabilities are offset if these relate to the same taxation authority.

The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that
are recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with
an effect on deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
aggregated into market regions below the segment level, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a
market region within the three operating segments of the STADA Group for the purpose of an impairment
test of goodwill.

STADA carries out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also
take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount
of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions which are taken in
order to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory
conditions, investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions
are taken individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly
based on internally determined assumptions which reflect both past experience and include external
market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. If on the balance sheet date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the
recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the
difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist,
corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of
these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. At STADA, this affects the umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in the context of the acquisition
of the Hemofarm group, as well as the umbrella brand Pymepharco capitalized in the context of achieving
control over Pymepharco. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through
annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether
the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized
development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of
individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs.
Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally
20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance which do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives must be depreciated separately, is not applied at STADA due to a lack of
relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are
reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset and property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each balance sheet date, STADA assesses whether

F-123


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for various market regions with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under ‘‘Other expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units within the STADA Group are defined at the level of individual assets within the
reportable segments of Branded Products, Generics and Commercial Business.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Leases are classified either as operating leases or as finance leases, depending on whether the significant**
risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor or with the lessee. The lease is not recognized in the
lessee’s balance sheet in case of operating leases. STADA records the lease payments for these leases in
the income over the lease term. Assets from finance leases are, on initial recognition, recognized at the
lower of the fair value of the lease and the present value of minimum lease payments, and are depreciated
according to their estimated useful lives or shorter contractual period. An amount is reported as lease
liability, when, on initial recognition, it corresponds to the lease’s carrying amount and is extinguished and
carried forward in subsequent periods with a constant effective interest rate. The interest that is part of the
lease installment is recognized as an expense.

In addition, in case of sale and leaseback transactions that represent a finance lease, any excess of sales
proceeds over the carrying amount is deferred and recognized in the income statement over the lease term.

The total value of capitalized leases is not of material significance for STADA when compared with the
total volume of fixed assets.

Under **financial assets, STADA recognizes shares in non-consolidated, affiliated companies and other**
investments. Shares in associated companies and other investments are classified as available-for-sale
financial assets and are generally reported at fair value with no effect on income. If no quoted market
prices in an active market are available to measure these shares and their fair value therefore cannot be
determined reliably, they are measured at amortized cost. If any objective indications of impairment are
determined, these are quantified by means of an impairment test and recognized in profit or loss in
accordance with IAS 39.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods),**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at
the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs are calculated based on weighted average costs. Costs of
sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and overheads that can be allocated to the
production process, including reasonable depreciation on production facilities. Financing costs are not
included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. Net realizable value is
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be broken down into the following categories in accordance with IAS 39: loans and**
receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and
held-to-maturity investments. Financial assets are accounted for and measured pursuant to IAS 39.
Accordingly, financial assets are, as a rule, initially recognized at fair value. In addition, for financial assets
which are subsequently measured at amortized cost, transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition are to be taken into account. Different measurement policies apply for subsequent
measurement in accordance with the applicable categories for financial assets pursuant to IAS 39.

**Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not**
quoted in an active market. They are allocated to current assets to the extent that they are due for

F-124

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

settlement within twelve months after the balance sheet date. STADA reports loans and receivables under
‘‘Trade accounts receivable’’, ‘‘Other financial assets’’ and ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’. They are
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

STADA reports receivables from derivatives which, if applicable, may also be part of hedge accounting, as
**financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Assets in this category are reported under the ‘‘Other**
financial assets’’ item. They are measured at fair value. If these assets do not have a quoted market price in
an active market, fair value is determined with appropriate measurement models. This includes the
application of discounted cash flow methods, which are largely based on input parameters observable in
the market. Changes in the fair values are recognized in profit and loss at the time of the increase or
decrease in value.

**Held-to-maturity financial investments include non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments**
and a fixed term that STADA intends to hold to maturity. They are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. STADA reports these assets in financial assets under the item ‘‘Other financial
assets’’.

**Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative assets that are not allocated to any of the above**
categories. In particular, they comprise, in addition to shares in affiliated companies and other investments
included in financial assets, equity securities which are recognized under ‘‘Other financial assets’’. They are
measured at fair value, with recognition of changes under ‘‘Provisions available for sale’’ directly in equity.
These measurement results are reclassified through profit and loss upon sale or valuation allowance of
these assets. There must be objective evidence that there is a significant or continuing decrease in fair
value below cost. Published price quotations usually can be used for determining fair value.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the
expected default risk, STADA determines the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by
debtor. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of
receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to
be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment thus determined
reduces the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are classified as held for sale, if the related carrying**
amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and if
the sale is regarded as highly probable. Measurement of these assets is based on the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**Cash and cash equivalents include cash and call deposits as well as short-term and highly liquid financial**
investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date, which can be converted to cash
immediately and are subject only to minor price fluctuation risks. They are measured at amortized cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are reported in accordance with their definition in IAS 7.

Other assets, which are not based on any contractual rights involving the direct or indirect exchange of
cash, are recognized under the item Other assets.

STADA maintains defined benefit plans in various countries, according to which the amount of pension
benefits depends on the employees’ pensionable remuneration and the length of their service or which
contain guarantees not permitting recognition as defined contribution plan. **Pension obligations are**
measured in accordance with actuarial principles using the projected unit credit method. The pension
provisions recognized in the balance sheet correspond to the present value of the defined benefit
obligation on the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets adjusted for the effect resulting from
any effect of limiting the benefit asset. In addition to earned pensions and entitlements, the calculation

F-125


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

also includes future salary and pension increases. For German Group companies, pension obligations are
calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. Outside
Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual
pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term market yields on high quality corporate
bonds with fixed interest rates at the end of the reporting period. In countries where there is no liquid
market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on
government bonds.

The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized directly in equity. It
differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions, due to changes in
financial assumptions as well as due to experience-based amendments. They are recognized directly in
equity in the period in which they occur (‘‘other comprehensive income, OCI’’). The relevant amounts are
reported separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the calculation of the
portion of the interest income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, the standard IAS 19
requires the application of the discount rate underlying the obligation. The remainder of the actual income
from plan assets is to be recognized directly in other comprehensive income. The current service cost is
recorded in staff costs of the individual functional areas. All past service cost that arises in the financial
year shall be recognized immediately through profit or loss.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements
or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans
are recognized as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas.

The **other non-current provisions contain anniversary provisions as other long-term employee benefits.**
Commitments to anniversary payments are recognized in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 as other
long-term employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not
recognized without an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately
recognized as income or expenditure in the relevant functional area. Furthermore, there is a working time
accounts plan which is accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.

**Other provisions are made by STADA if there are current legal or constructive obligations to third parties**
arising from past events, which will probably lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
that can be reliably determined. An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered
probable if it is more likely than not. Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into
account all recognizable risks, offers the best possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the
obligations. Any existing reimbursement claims by third parties are not netted with other provisions.
Expenses from the creation of provisions are allocated to functional costs according to where they arise. If
changes in estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other provisions are reversed on a pro rata
basis and recognized in profit and loss under the item where the original expense was recognized.

STADA reports all other provisions as current liabilities, because a settlement date within twelve months
of the balance date is expected. The amounts recognized are not discounted. Liabilities incurred due to
outstanding accounts or obligations to personnel and tax authorities, as well as other liabilities are not
recorded as provisions, but under ‘‘Trade accounts payable’’ or ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

Differentiated from provisions, there are contingent liabilities for possible obligations based on past events
but which will not become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are
not under STADA’s control. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for
which however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the
obligation cannot be adequately estimated. In accordance with IAS 37, such contingent liabilities are not
recognized.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values that are not part of an
effective hedging relationship and allocated to the category ‘‘at fair value through profit or loss’’ in

F-126


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

accordance with IAS 39. STADA reports these liabilities in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item. Here,
those derivative financial instruments are also included which serve to hedge interest rate and currency
risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments, and which are also
measured at fair value in accordance with the regulations of IAS 39 on hedge accounting. Unless market
prices are available, fair value is determined with measurement models based on discounted cash flow
models.

**Derivative financial instruments exist at STADA in the context of derivatives measured at fair value with an**
effect on income as well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. In each case, depending on
whether the market value of the derivatives is positive or negative, they are recognized under the item
‘‘Other financial assets’’ or ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ (see accounting policies for financial assets and
financial liabilities). Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging instruments in the context of hedge accounting
in accordance with IAS 39.

At STADA, cash flow hedges are used to hedge against fluctuations of cash flows associated with a
recognized asset or a recognized liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the fair
value of these hedging instruments are recognized in the amount of the effective part of the hedging
relationship directly in equity under ‘‘Provisions for cash flow hedges’’. A transfer to the income statement
takes place in the period when the underlying hedged item becomes effective. The ineffective part of the
changes in value is, however, recognized directly in the income statement.

In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of recognized assets or recognized
liabilities or fixed off balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions
are recorded in profit and loss like changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. If the
requirements for hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously hedged items
are adjusted on the basis of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign operation are
treated according to the same accounting policies as cash flow hedges.

STADA regularly reviews the effectiveness of the hedging relationships as a prerequisite for hedge
accounting pursuant to IAS 39. A hedging transaction is in general considered to be effective, if changes in
fair value of the hedging transaction are both prospectively and retrospectively within a range of 80% to
125% of the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item.

STADA measures all other financial liabilities, in particular trade accounts payable as well as financial
liabilities, at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

STADA has so far not made use of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as
financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

Other liabilities, which are not based on any contractual rights involving the direct or indirect exchange of
cash, are recognized under the item ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the business, financial and earnings situation in the consolidated financial statements
is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, STADA makes estimates and
assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are
considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are
constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual circumstances. The significant
estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed
below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this, which are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

F-127

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

STADA carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units aggregated to market regions below the segment level, which are
based on certain assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. The discounted cash flow method is
used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a
detailed planning period of three years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year
detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term
inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some
uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal developments and developments in the health care market,
as well as the parameters determined in the context of current market information but also as a best
possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and
despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment may be necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are recognized as advance payments, the
growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of
active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment
tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
situation of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction.
In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income
tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to
IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of
assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding
effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group
in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the STADA Group is being allotted to
a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Possible risks of
non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes are limited by the introduction of appropriate
communication methods and an overarching definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the balance sheet date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension expenses.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and

F-128


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success of these methods. The
determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates, which can change
due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for warranties may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements, which are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

STADA’s sales primarily result from the supply of products. For information on the reporting of sales,
please refer to the details included in Accounting Policies.

In 2015, the increase in sales compared to 2014 was primarily based on the good sales development in the
market regions Central Europe and Asia/Pacific & MENA. This development was mainly characterized by
the acquisition of the British company Internis as well as an increase in sales in the United Kingdom,
Spain, Italy and Vietnam. Exchange rate effects and portfolio changes had a total influence of
A 28.7 million on sales in the reporting year. For information on how sales are broken down according to
segments and market regions, please refer to the Segment Reporting in Note 42.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in E 000s** **2015** **2014**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 874,066 853,464
Impairment, depreciation and amortization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101,497 100,779
Expenses from inventory write-downs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36,545 33,747
Remaining cost of sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 89,601 82,451

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,101,709** **1,070,441**

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A 101.5 million (previous year:
A 100.8 million) mainly includes amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a
necessary condition for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with
reversals. The reversals amounted to A 7.2 million in financial year 2015 (previous year: A 9.3 million).

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and sales force, selling expenses also comprise the costs for
advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics
that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts
in kind,—if possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not included. The resulting
expenses are recognized as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing expenses in the amount of A 210.0 million (previous year: A 186.4 million)
corresponded to a share of 44% in selling expenses (previous year: 41%). In addition, selling expenses
included depreciation in the amount of A 7.1 million (previous year: A 7.4 million).

F-129

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2015, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A 7.9 million
(previous year: A 10.2 million).

General and administrative expenses increased in the reporting year by a total of A 25.5 million. The
increase primarily resulted from net earnings in the amount of A 15.9 million from 2014, mainly from past
service cost in connection with a change in the defined benefit plan for the Chairman of the Executive
Board and the resulting changes with regard to the benefits awarded in accordance with the former benefit
plan.

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details
included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2015, research and development expenses increased by A 8.1 million compared to the
previous year.

The research and development expenses include depreciation in the amount of A 2.1 million (previous
year: A 2.6 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A 26.1 million (previous year:
A 27.5 million) were capitalized in financial year 2015 (see the note on the item ‘‘Intangible assets’’).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

**in E 000s** **2015** **2014**

Income from disposals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,317 43
Remaining other income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17,715 20,024

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **20,032** **20,067**

The income from disposals mainly resulted from the deconsolidation of the French subsidiary Laboratoires
d’´etudes et de recherches en oligo elements th´erapie SA.

The remaining other income includes such items as income from damage claim payments received and
other income not directly associated with functional costs, which comprises many insignificant individual
items in the Group companies.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

**in E 000s** **2015** **2014**

Expenses from valuation allowances on accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,367 3,809
Currency translation expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19,549 29,415
Impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32,790 47,723
Impairment losses on goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 410 59,808
Remaining other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21,593 14,488

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **83,709** **155,243**

Expenses for valuation allowances on accounts receivable were recognized netted with the corresponding
income from their reversal.

Other expenses include impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill in the amount of
A 32.8 million (previous year: A 47.7 million). In addition, impairment losses on goodwill regarding the

F-130

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**17. Other expenses (Continued)**

market region Asia/Pacific & MENA were recorded in the reporting year. These impairment losses were
considered by STADA as a special effect of financial year 2015.

The item also included net currency translation expenses in the amount of A19.5 million in the reporting
year (previous year: A 29.4 million). This development is especially attributable to the strong devaluation of
the significant currencies of the market region CIS/Eastern Europe and the resulting currency translation
expenses.

Within remaining other expenses, personnel expenses are recognized in the amount of A 4.4 million
(previous year: A 5.8 million).

**18. Financial result**

The **result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2015 relates to the companies**
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS as well as

As part of a change in reporting, interest rate expenses from currency swaps are reported as part of the
interest result for the first time in financial year 2015. If this reporting had been implemented in the
previous year, the interest expense would have increased by A 2.7 million.

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2015 includes an interest expense from other non-current
provisions, which comprises interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from pension
obligations and other non-current provisions, in the amount of A 1.0 million (previous year: A 2.0 million).

In financial year 2015, the Group refinanced itself at interest rates of between 0.7% p.a. and 16.6% p.a.
(previous year: between 0.9% p.a. and 12.0% p.a.). On the balance sheet date of December 31, 2015, the
weighted average interest rate for non-current financial liabilities was approx. 2.0% p.a. (previous year:
approx. 3.3% p.a.) and for current financial liabilities approx. 5.1% p.a. (previous year: approx. 4.6% p.a.).
For all of the Group’s financial liabilities the weighted average interest amounted to approx. 2.6% p.a.
(previous year: approx. 3.7% p.a.).

Interest payments partially resulting from interest rate swaps designated by STADA as hedging
instruments in cash flow hedges are not netted for each swap contract and are recognized as interest
income or interest expense in the valuation category of the associated underlying hedged item. For the
reporting period, this exclusively concerns financial liabilities which were valued at amortized costs.

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A 1.0 million in financial
year 2015 (previous year: A 0.7 million). A capitalization rate of 2.3% for intangible assets (previous year:
3.1%) was taken as a basis.

Other financial income and other financial expenses consist of the following:

The result from the measurement of financial instruments in the reporting period resulted from interest
rate swaps and interest rate/currency swaps measured at fair value through profit or loss. There was a net
burden on earnings in the amount of A 3.1 million before or A 3.1 million after taxes. In the previous year,
there was a net relief on earnings from the measurement of derivative financial instruments in the amount
of A 3.6 million before or A 3.6 million after taxes. The measurement of interest rate hedge transactions
thereby depends on the development of the money market interest rate.

**19. Income taxes (Continued)**

The effective income tax rate amounted to 25.8% for financial year 2015. The effective income tax rate in
the previous year was 43.8%. The nominal income tax rate amounted to 27.4% in financial year 2015 for
STADA Arzneimittel AG in Germany, this includes corporation tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the
solidarity surcharge in the amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 330%. In
the previous year, the nominal income tax rate of STADA Arzneimittel AG amounted to 26.3%. The
difference mainly results from an increase of the assessment rate for the trade income tax in the amount of
30 percentage points in Bad Vilbel.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement
was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes. The
tax effects of the respective tax rates to be applied locally depending on their applicable national and legal
forms are reported in a separate reconciliation.

Tax effects from non-deductible impairments of investment and goodwill in the previous year hereby
resulted mainly from impairments of goodwill in the market regions CIS/Eastern Europe and
Asia/Pacific & MENA.

Tax effects from loss carryforwards mainly result from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards for which no
deferred tax assets have been recognized so far.

The effects from tax rate changes mainly result from a reduction of the tax rate in the United Kingdom and
the corresponding re-measurement of deferred taxes.

Deferred tax liabilities reported by STADA resulted, among other things, from deferred taxes in the
context of purchase price allocations carried out under IFRS 3. Deferred tax liabilities decreased as
compared to the previous year primarily as a result of a reduction of the tax rate in the United Kingdom
and the corresponding remeasurement of deferred taxes.

Tax advantages that are highly probable and expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards
are recognized under ‘‘Deferred taxes from loss carryforwards’’.

Tax loss carryforwards are only capitalized if their future utilization is highly probable. Tax loss
carryforwards capitalized as of the December 31, 2015 reporting date amounted to A 73.2 million in
financial year 2015 (previous year: A 60.1 million).

Income taxes decreased by a total of A 6.6 million (previous year: increase of income tax expense by
A 0.1 million) through the utilization of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards from previous years
for which no deferred taxes have been recognized so far and through tax loss carryforwards from the
current financial year for which no deferred taxes have been recognized.

The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to

Diluted earnings per share are generally calculated with the formula used to calculate the basic earnings
per share. They are also adjusted for the effect of outstanding share options on the basis of the average
share price of the financial year. This is carried out based on the assumption that all potentially dilutive
share options are exercised. Details on currently valid equity instruments are included in the Notes on
equity. The share options from the STADA warrants mentioned had expired as of June 26, 2015.

The average number of employees in the reporting year was above the level of the previous year at
10,441 (previous year: 10,209). The most substantial reasons for the increase in the number of employees
include the consolidation as of January 1, 2015 of the subsidiary STADA Egypt Ltd., the acquisition of
British company Internis Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and the purchase of Austrian company SCIOTEC
Diagnostic Technologies with a total of 52 employees. On the balance sheet date, the STADA Group’s
number of employees in 2015 totaled 10,532 (previous year: 10,363).

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their
functional relevance, increased in financial year 2015 to A 342,7 million (previous year: A 305.1 million).
The increase was primarily a result of earnings recorded in the previous year within personnel expenses
from past service cost in connection with a change in the defined benefit plan for the Chairman of the
Executive Board and the resulting changes with regard to the benefits awarded according to the former
benefit plan.

**23. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are included in expenses of the individual functional
areas according to their functional relevance and can be attributed to intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment as follows:

The impairment of intangible assets concerns various drug approvals and trademarks.

The impairments on goodwill recorded in the previous year relate to goodwill of the market region
CIS/Eastern Europe as well as of the market region Asia/Pacific & MENA.

The impairments of financial assets in the reporting year primarily relate to the carrying amounts of
Hetmak FZCO in Dubai. The impairments in the previous year primarily related to the carrying amounts
of STADApharm AB in Sweden.

Depreciation and amortization decreased by 1.9% compared to the previous year. More information on
amortization, depreciation and impairment losses is included in the Notes on non-current assets.

Additions from business combinations according to IFRS 3, which relate to the fair values determined in
the context of the purchase price allocations, mainly resulted from the acquisition of the British Socialites
Group with A 32.3 million and with A 18.4 million from the purchase of the Austrian company SCIOTEC
Diagnostic Technologies GmbH.

The umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the Hemofarm
group is included in recognized trademarks as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as STADA
intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2015, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount
of A 45.4 million (previous year: A 47.6 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31,
2015, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 13.0% was used. This resulted in a necessity for
impairment in the amount of A 2.0 million for the reporting year. In addition, the change compared to the
previous year figure of A 0.2 million is a result of different exchange rates.

Furthermore, in the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in 2013, the umbrella brand
Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as STADA
intends to continue to use the trademark. As of December 31, 2015, it has a carrying amount of
A 9.5 million (previous year: A 9.1 million). The change is a result of different exchange rates. In the context
of the impairment test of December 31, 2015, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 14.9% were used.
There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2015 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A 1.0 million (previous year: A 0.7 million). In financial year
2015, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
2.3% (previous year: 3.1%).

**24. Intangible assets (Continued)**

Development costs of A 27.5 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A 28.7 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life, generally 20 years. STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization as expense in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year 2015,
these development costs amounted to A 65.0 million (previous year: A 56.9 million).

Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is
recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an
amount of A 84.4 million (previous year: A 87.7 million).

In financial year 2015, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A32.9 million (previous year: A 104.8 million). These include value adjustments of goodwill in the market
region Asia/Pacific & MENA in the amount of A 0.4 million, which resulted in the context of the
impairment test carried out in the reporting year due to the existing knowledge and expectations related to
the market and competitive environment. In addition, further intangible assets in the amount of
A 32.5 million were impaired, mainly as a result of unchanged higher risks in the market region CIS/
Eastern Europe.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation
(see Note 5.).

For the purposes of impairment tests for capitalized goodwill, STADA defines cash-generating units as the
respective market regions within the operating segments in accordance with the strategic planning and
control of the Group.

In comparison with the previous year, there were the following significant changes in the carrying amounts
of goodwill:

- The increase in goodwill of the cash-generating unit market region Central Europe, Branded Products
segment, primarily resulted from the acquisitions of the Austrian company SCIOTEC and the British
Socialites group.

- The increase in goodwill of the cash-generating unit market region Asia/Pacific & MENA, Branded
Products segment, primarily resulted from the appreciation of the Vietnamese dong. In opposition, an
impairment in the amount of A 0.4 million resulted from the impairment tests carried out in the
reporting year due to existing knowledge and expectations related to the market and competitive
environment. The value in use of the cash-generating unit as of September 30, 2015 was at
A 73.5 million.

In the context of the regular impairment tests for capitalized goodwill of September 30, 2015, the
discounted cash flow method is used to determine anticipated cash inflows, applying the following
parameters defined for the individual cash-generating units according to segment:

**WACCs 2015**
**Growth rates of** **WACCs 2015** **WACCs 2015** **Commercial**
**forward-projection** **Generics** **Branded Products** **Business**

Market region Asia/Pacific & MENA . . . . 4.4% 16.3% 16.3% 16.4%

In the previous year, the applied parameters were as follows:

**WACCs 2014**
**Growth rates of** **WACCs 2014** **WACCs 2014** **Commercial**
**forward-projection** **Generics** **Branded Products** **Business**

Market region Asia/Pacific & MENA . . . . 4.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.6%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and medium-term market
developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth
rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for
the determination of the value in use is based on assumptions in light of past experience, supplemented by
current internal developments and verified through external market data and analyses. The most important
assumptions include the development of future sales prices, amounts and costs, the influence of the
regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth rates. Significant
changes to the above-described assumptions would influence the determination of the value in use of the
cash-generating units. Possible changes to these assumptions would negatively influence the
cash-generating units as a result of continued strong competition and regulatory interventions. The
discount rates applied are determined on the basis of external factors derived from the market and
adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the cash-generating units.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. The following table shows what additional impairments would have come for the
different cash-generating units as a result of a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the
growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points:

**Generics segment sensitivity analysis** **WACC** **Growth rate** **EBIT**

as a result of the sensitivity analysis.

With a reduction in discount rates of 1.0 percentage points, an increase in the growth rate of
0.5 percentage points and an increase in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points, impairments in the market region

**33. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as short-term and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subjected to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the
respective national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash
equivalents amount to A 2.3 million (previous year: A 1.7 million) and, as in the previous year, exclusively
relate to cash and cash equivalents in China.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from A 164.2 million as of December 31, 2014 to A 143.2 million
as of December 31, 2015 is primarily due to reporting date effects. Further details on the development of
cash and cash equivalents can be found in the consolidated cash flow statement.

**34. Equity and liabilities**

Group equity amounted to A 1,018.5 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: A 903.3 million).
This corresponds to an equity-to-assets ratio of 31.0% (previous year: 27.1%).

As of December 31, 2015, share capital amounted to A 162,090,344.00 (December 31,
2014: A 157,629,420.00) and was divided into 62,342,440 registered shares with restricted transferability
(December 31, 2014: 60,626,700), each with an arithmetical share of share capital of A 2.60 per share, and
is fully paid. Each registered share grants one vote in the Annual General Meeting.

The increase in the number of shares in 2015 was due to the exercise of 85,787 options from STADA
warrants 2000/2015 in 2015. The number of shares as of December 31, 2015 thereby increased by 1,715,740
to 62,342,440 and the share capital of STADA Arzneimittel AG increased by A 4,460,924.00 to
A 162,090,344.00. The exercise period of the warrants expired at the end of June 26, 2015, therefore there
were no more warrants outstanding for subscription as of December 31, 2015.

As of December 31, 2015, authorized share capital and conditional capital were comprised as follows:

**Registered shares**
**with restricted**
**Amount in E** **transferability** **Purpose**

Authorized capital . . . . . . . . . . . 77,134,304.00 29,667,040 Increase of share capital (until
June 4, 2018)
Conditional Capital 2013 . . . . . . . 69,188,340.00 26,610,900 Settlement of options and/or
conversion rights (until June 4,
2018) in connection with issued
bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds, participation
rights and/or participating bonds
in the total nominal amount of up
to A 1.0 billion, or in the scope of
a guarantee assumed for bonds
with warrants and/or convertible
bonds, participation rights and/or
participating bonds issued by
subordinate Group companies

**34.2. Capital reserve**

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and particularly include the capital reserve of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Differences from the capital
reserve determined according to the provisions of German commercial law primarily result from the
recognition at their market value of the shares of STADA Arzneimittel AG newly issued in 2003 as well as
the associated treatment of issuing costs, which were deducted from the capital reserve.

**34. Equity and liabilities (Continued)**

The increase of the capital reserve in the financial year by A 23,770,371.60 to A 514,171,360.77 also
primarily results from the exercise of 85,787 options from STADA warrants 2000/2015 described in
Note 34.1.

**34.3. Retained earnings including net income**

Retained earnings including net income comprise net income for the financial year as well as earnings
generated in previous periods, provided these were not distributed, including amounts transferred to
retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized
directly in equity are reported under this item, taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015, net income in the
amount of A 2.7 million after deferred taxes—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling
interests—resulted from the remeasurement. It is mainly based on the increase in the discount rate for
various defined benefit plans in the STADA Group underlying the measurement of December 31, 2015 in
comparison with December 31, 2014.

Furthermore, retained earnings include an adjustment of the previous year recognized directly in equity in
the amount of A 1.2 million in connection with a company accounted for at equity.

**34.4. Other provisions**

Other provisions include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are recognized in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve. The provision ‘‘available for sale’’ and the provision for cash flow
hedges include the results from the measurement at fair value of financial instruments categorized as
available for sale, and the measurement results from cash flow hedges from the effective portion of the
hedge, allowing for respective deferred taxes.

The growth in other provisions as compared to the previous year is primarily composed of the following
opposing effects: On the one hand, the devaluation of the Russian ruble since December 31, 2014 led to
expenses recognized directly in equity from the currency translation of financial statements of companies
reporting in Russian ruble. On the other hand, due to the appreciation of the currencies British pound
sterling and Swiss franc since December 31, 2014, income recognized directly in equity from the currency
translation of financial statements of companies reporting in these currencies was recorded.

**34.5. Treasury shares**

As of the balance sheet date, the Company held 87,259 treasury shares (previous year: 89,835), each with
an arithmetical par value of A 2.60 per share, which is equivalent to 0.14% (previous year: 0.15%) of the
share capital. In financial year 2015, 2,576 treasury shares were sold at an average price of A 29.78 per
share within the scope of an employee stock option program.

**34.6. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares of non-controlling shareholders relate to minority interests of other shareholders in the subsidiaries
STADA Thailand, STADA Import/Export International, STADA Vietnam, Pymepharco, STADA
Pharmaceuticals (Beijing), Well Light Investment Services, Hemomont and Hemofarm Banja Luka.

**35. Other non-current provisions**

Other non-current provisions made by STADA as of the balance sheet date in Germany and outside
Germany include pension provisions and other non-current provisions in the form of anniversary
provisions and provisions for working time accounts as follows:

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among others, government bonds and securities funds.

In financial year 2015, the plan assets of one German and one international subsidiary exceeded their
pension obligations, with the result that these assets in excess were reported under other assets as assets
from overfunded pension plans in the amount of A 0.1 million (previous year: A 0.1 million).

Plan assets were divided according to investment type as follows:

**Share of plan assets in E 000s** **2015** **2014**

In the Gulf region and in Egypt there are legally required defined benefit plans for termination benefits,
which have been newly included in the scope of consolidation in the current reporting period. Past service
costs mainly result from the inclusion of these plans. Furthermore, a plan curtailment was carried out in
the Netherlands, which was recognized as past service cost in accordance with IAS 19.

In Belgium, the general market assessment has changed substantially, so that pension plans formerly
regarded as defined contribution plans must now be regarded as defined benefit plans. Reclassifications
carried out in the amount of A 4.8 million relate to these new classifications as defined benefit plans.
Furthermore, one plan was removed from the scope of consolidation due to the sale of a French company.

As of December 31, 2015, the weighted duration of the pension obligations amounts to 21 years (previous
year: 23 years) for German Group companies and 17 years (previous year: 19 years) for international
Group companies.

In the coming financial years, the following payments from the Company and from plan assets overall are
expected for defined benefit plans:

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan, are expected in the amount of A 0.8 million for German Group companies and
A 2.7 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the
company. For the STADA Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 83%. Accordingly, the following details
focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz -BetrAVG), in which the minimum legal requirements for company pension plans
are embedded. Regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The pension plans
are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan
participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension.

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2015, plan assets amounted to A 37.3 million and were composed of
three different plans. There are no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced in financial
year 2014. Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development and the risk that
the real future salary development exceeds the salary development derived from assumptions taken in the
evaluation.

The pension commitment for the Chairman of the Executive Board was transferred to a pension fund in
full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of
STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and
recognize it accordingly. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be

carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is
fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future.

Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that
the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands
is, in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned
requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement
or early death.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan is partially financed via contributions to an insurance company.
Assets received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies.
The assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to
the amount of vested benefit obligations. In practice, the assets are estimated according to the amount of
vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2015, plan assets amounted to A 22.7 million.

The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest
rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of
investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the
contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should
change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future
contributions received.

Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees
have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the
evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the
insurance, the company could be required to pay an additional contribution payment.

In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees with defined benefit plans that are concluded for
new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plan plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator. The pension plans are
monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for
fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the
technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and
participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the
discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional
contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to
expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

In the long-term, 40% of the plan assets in the United Kingdom should be invested in so-called matching
assets, which guarantee the fulfillment of future pension obligations under changing market conditions. In
accordance with target allocation, the remaining 60% should be invested in so-called growth assets, for
which an above-average return is expected in comparison with the obligation development. As of
December 31, 2015, plan assets amounted to A 24.1 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an
active market.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan according to federal pension law
(Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option.

The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in
the relevant functional areas, amounted to A 22.4 million in financial year 2015.

The change in financial liabilities was mainly based on the placement of another bond in the first quarter
of 2015 with a nominal value in the amount of A 300 million for the refinancing of a corporate bond with a
nominal value of A 350 million which reached maturity in April 2015. In addition, two new loans were
taken out in the third quarter of 2015. In opposition, financial liabilities were repaid in the current
financial year.

For the financial liabilities existing as of the balance sheet date, a repayment in accordance with the
maturity disclosed in the balance sheet was generally assumed. For current liabilities due to banks, an
extension of existing credit lines was partly assumed. The variable interest payments from the promissory
note loans were determined based on the interest rate last fixed before December 31, 2015.

Internal measures to ensure the necessary liquidity for repayment of financial liabilities are detailed in the
Notes on the capital management of liquidity risk (see Note 46.5.).

**38. Other financial liabilities (Continued)**

As of December 31, 2015 the outstanding purchase price liabilities were mainly based on amounts from the
acquisition of the British Socialites group and various products in the United Kingdom, which were not yet
due. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding purchase price liabilities had primarily resulted from
installments which were not yet due for the acquisition of branded products in Russia as well as the
outstanding contingent purchase price payment for the acquisition of the British company Internis.

Finance lease liabilities, such as for vehicles and passenger vehicles, amount to A2.2 million (previous year:
A3.1 million). Considering interest in the amount of A 0.3 million (previous year: A 0.6 million), lease
installments payable in subsequent years total A 2.5 million (previous year: A 3.7 million). The lease
liabilities are due as follows:

In addition, the negative market values of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss were
reported in liabilities from derivative financial instruments. In financial year 2015, as in the previous year,
this continued to relate to interest rate swaps, which are used as hedging instruments as well as crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards (see Note 46.7.). Within the scope of the maturity date analysis, the
following contractually agreed remaining terms result for these derivative financial liabilities:

Remaining financial liabilities include liabilities from discount agreements of German STADA companies
in the amount of A 178.3 million (previous year: A192.1 million) and furthermore comprise many
insignificant individual items in the Group companies. The remaining financial liabilities fall due in the
amount of A 202.5 million (previous year: A 223.8 million) within one year, in the amount of A 3.2 million
after one year and up to five years (previous year: A 0.5 million).

**Other Disclosures**

**41. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure,
financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in
foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from
operating activities amounted to A 311.7 million in the reporting year (previous year: A 223.8 million). The
increase in cash flow from operating activities of A 87.9 million compared to the previous year is primarily
due to a decreased cash-efficiency in the area of other net assets. The resulting positive effects on
operating cash flow were, on the one hand, reinforced by lower income tax payments than in the previous
year and, on the other hand, only partly compensated through a cash-effective increase in trade
receivables.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from
disposals. It amounted to A �178.2 million in the reporting year (previous year: A �262.0 million).

In financial year 2015, payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A 81.4 million
(previous year: A 181.4 million) were made, of which A 32.3 million (previous year: A 147.5 million) related
to significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio.
Acquisition-related sales growth was generally associated with these investments in the reporting year.
Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets in the financial year amounted to A 11.8 million (previous
year: A 12.0 million).

In financial year 2015, cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by the settlement of
outstanding payments for the acquisition of the Russian branded product portfolio Aqualor�, the Russian
branded products AndroDoz� and NeroDoz�, as well as the British company Internis Pharmaceuticals.
Furthermore, purchase price payments from the acquisition of the Austrian company SCIOTEC
Diagnostic Technologies as well as the British Socialites group are included in cash flow from investing
activities. Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies exclusively relate to the
deconsolidation of the French subsidiary Laboratoires d’´etudes et de recherches en oligo ´el´ements
th´erapie SA. The sales price amounted to A 7.3 million and was/is to be paid in cash or cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents in the amount of A 0.6 million, assets in the amount of A 6.2 million and
liabilities in the amount of A 2.1 million were thereby disposed of. Proceeds from the disposal of intangible
assets mainly resulted from the sale of approvals and trademarks in France and Italy. In the previous year,
payments for investments in intangible assets primarily related to the purchase of the Russian branded
product portfolio Aqualor�. Furthermore, there were payments for business combinations from the
purchase of the branded product portfolio Flexitol� and the acquisition of the British company Internis in
the previous year.

Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A �155.1 million in financial year 2015 (previous year:
A 83.7 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution
payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. This development
is primarily attributable to proceeds from the placement of a corporate bond with a nominal value in the
amount of A 300 million for the refinancing of a corporate bond with a nominal value of A 350 million
which reached maturity in April 2015. Furthermore, two new loans were taken out in financial year 2015 in

F-159

**41. Notes to the cash flow statement (Continued)**

the amount A 20 million and A 25 million respectively. In the previous year, there were proceeds from
securing financial liabilities, among other things, in connection with promissory note loans secured in
financial year 2014 in the total amount of A 270 million and a loan in the amount of approx. A 121 million
for financing the purchase of the branded product portfolio Aqualor�. Furthermore, more financial
liabilities were repaid in the reporting period than in the previous year.

Dividend distribution payments of A 40.0 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders
of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2014.

Proceeds from the capital increase are the result of the exercise of STADA warrants 2000/2015 (see
Note 34.1. and 34.2.).

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities
amounted to A 133.5 million in financial year 2015 (previous year: A �38.2 million) and is therefore still
significantly characterized by a high volume of acquisitions.

of proceeds from significant disposals is calculated as follows:

**42. Segment information**

The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting
methods used in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Services between the segments are charged
based on market prices.

Segmentation within the STADA Group is based on sales differentiation. Thus, the allocation to the
individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for
parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reallocated.

Generally, STADA’s operating segments are divided into the two core segments Generics and Branded
Products, as well as into the non-core segment Commercial Business.

Pursuant to STADA’s segment definition, which has been used since 2006, Generics are products for the
health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or several active ingredients whose
commercial property rights have expired or will expire shortly and whose sales positioning complies with
one of the two following criteria:

- The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another
supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient,

or

- the product is an integral part of a marketing concept targeting more than one product and indication
for primarily prescription products with active ingredients whose commercial property rights have
usually expired.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**42. Segment information (Continued)**

According to STADA’s segment definition, which has been used since 2006, Branded Products are products
for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients whose commercial property
rights have usually expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two following criteria:

- The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products,

or

- the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly
sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products.

STADA also conducts business and has equity interests in fields outside the core segments. As a rule, the
objective of these activities is to supplement and support the Group’s activities in the core segments.
Transactions that mainly involve trading and selling—such as in wholesaling activities—are grouped
together in the Commercial Business segment. All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be
directly allocated to the segments, as well as the elimination of sales between segments are recognized
under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and consolidation.

STADA aggregates business segments into the reportable segments of Generics, Branded Products and
Commercial Business, because the type of products, the sales methods and the regulatory framework
conditions are largely comparable across market regions.

Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not,
however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In
addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance
organization billings are included here. Reporting of the segment liabilities and non-current segment assets
is waived, as this is without relevance for Group monitoring and for Group reporting.

In the presentation of sales by the company’s registered office, sales to third parties are shown according to
the invoicing company’s registered office of the countries listed.

Disclosures on assets by country relate to parts of the non-current assets (intangible assets, property, plant
and equipment).

**42.5. Information about major customers**

In accordance with IFRS 8.34, a company must provide notification when sales revenues from business
activities from a single external customer amount to at least 10% of the company’s total sales revenues. As
in the previous year, this related to no customer in the reporting year.

**43. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations with respect to third parties which result from past
events and which may lead to a future outflow of resources depending on specific events. As of the balance
sheet date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are therefore not recognized.

STADA has contingent liabilities, among other things, in connection with patent risks for certain active
pharmaceutical ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The resulting possible
obligations amounted to approx. A 12.4 million (previous year: A 18.9 million). The reduction of contingent

F-163

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**43. Contingent liabilities (Continued)**

liabilities compared with the previous year is mainly due to a changed assessment of possible obligations as
of the balance sheet date in the market region Central Europe. Potential obligations from the previous
year in the amount of A 2.8 million in the market region CIS/Eastern Europe no longer exist. Provisions
were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under 50%. Outflows
potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

The lawsuit that the insolvency administrator of Velefarm Holding and Velefarm VFB had submitted to
Belgrade’s commercial court against Hemofarm A.D., a subsidiary of STADA Arzneimittel AG, and
Velefarm Prolek, a company of the Velefarm group, in the first quarter of 2014 was settled on
December 18, 2015.[(1)] Within the scope of the settlement, the insolvency administrator waives his original
claim in the amount of approx. A 54.2 million (in local currency translated using the currency exchange rate
at that time), which he had filed in court. In return, Hemofarm waives most of a claim in the single-digit
million euro range which was already fully impaired by STADA in 2010. Hemofarm and STADA believed
that the lawsuit is unfounded and for this reason, no provisions were made for this purpose.

**44. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there were other future financial obligations, which can be broken
down as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2015** **Dec. 31, 2014**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 81,288 72,892

Liabilities from operating leases relate particularly to IT equipment and vehicles. In addition, there are
liabilities from long-term rental agreements for office buildings with an average contract term of five years.

The total of future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to A 81.3 million as of the
end of the financial year (previous year: A 72.9 million) and can be broken down according to remaining
term as follows:

**Operating leases**
**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2015** **Dec. 31, 2014**

Lease payments in the amount of A 30.5 million (previous year: A 29.2 million) were recognized as an
expense in financial year 2015.

There is still a guarantee amounting to A 25.0 million towards Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, in
connection with a supply agreement between Hospira and the shares in the associated company
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG which are recognized under the equity method.

STADA, as guarantor, has recognized this guarantee in the reporting year as financial guarantee in
accordance with IAS 39 at its fair value in the amount of A 0.3 million (previous year: A 0.3 million).
Utilization of this guarantee granted is currently not expected.

Furthermore, additional guarantees assumed by the STADA Group are included in other financial
liabilities, among other things.

**45. Disclosures about financial instruments (Continued)**

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short remaining terms,
their carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to the fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of
promissory note loans, bonds, as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the
current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the fair values.

Available-for-sale financial assets are primarily the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated
investments which are entirely measured at amortized cost for lack of available market prices.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables as well as of held-to-maturity financial investments with
remaining terms of more than a year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respectively current interest parameters that reflect market and
partner-related changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade accounts payable as well as remaining
financial liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the
fair values.

For the disclosures according to class of financial instrument necessary in accordance with IFRS 7, STADA
defines each valuation category as a class.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, STADA reviews the allocation to the
respective hierarchy levels according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If the
need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the
reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy
levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Available-for-sale financial assets (AfS) of the previous year related to shares for which market prices were
available for measurement. Derivative financial assets (FAHfT) and derivative financial liabilities (FLHfT)
include positive or negative market values of derivative financial instruments (interest rate/currency swaps
and foreign exchange swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values were determined using
appropriate valuation models by external third parties. This includes the application of discounted cash
flow methods, which are largely based on input parameters observable in the market. The cash flows which
are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve are discounted to the measurement date
with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the balance sheet date. The same
applies for the calculation of the fair values of the derivative financial liabilities with a hedging

The assets held for sale of the previous year comprised real estate held by a STADA subsidiary in Serbia,
which was reclassified to non-current assets as of the balance-sheet date. The non-recurring basis for the
determination of fair value was based on an appraisal prepared by an independent expert and was largely
determined based on input parameters observable in the market.

As STADA utilizes pricing information from external third parties without further correction in the
determination of the fair value, and therefore does not produce any quantitative, non-observable input
factors, the option of IFRS 13 to waive the disclosure of quantitative information on such input factors is
taken.

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result. Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from interest rate/currency swaps and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value with an
effect on income, which are reported under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the
currency translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other
income or other expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to currency swaps
expired in financial year 2015 and the partial fulfillment of cross-currency swaps.

Valuation results from financial assets held for sale and cash flow hedges, which are reported under other
comprehensive income in equity, are not included in this presentation as they had no effect on income.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**

**46.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Executive Board in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all
transactions above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Executive Board must first be approved
by the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount
of current risks. With a view to assets, liabilities and planned transactions, these risks relate in particular to
changes in exchange rates and interest rates. It is the objective of financial risk management to limit these
market risks of ongoing operative and finance-related activities. For this purpose, depending on the
assessment of the financial risk, selected derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments are used.

However, in principle only financial risks which have significant consequences on the Group’s cash flow are
hedged.

**46.2. Currency risks**

STADA’s Group and balance sheet currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, STADA is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

STADA counters risks from currency-related cash flow fluctuations with derivative financial instruments,
which are exclusively used to hedge currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions
and investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

In addition to natural hedges, STADA generally employs different financial derivatives to hedge assets,
liabilities and anticipated future cash flows denominated in foreign currency. In the reporting year 2015,
STADA made particular use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The
maturity dates of futures contracts are thereby selected to match the Company’s anticipated cash flows.
These contracts are currently valid for up to two years.

In the context of consolidated financial statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to
an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of
earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro
(translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally negative
and depreciation is generally positive. Currency risks primarily stem from business transactions in the
following currencies: Russian ruble, pound sterling and Serbian dinar. This risk is not hedged.

It cannot be ruled out, however, that hedging strategies against currency risks turn out to be insufficient,
wrong or suboptimal.

STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In case of hedging transactions they are compared with the positive
or negative balances from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign

currency items as of the respective balance sheet dates, which in case of a change to the foreign currency
item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% depreciation of the respective functional currency are as follows:

respective functional
currency by 10% . . . . . . . . . +2,053 +2,054 +3,740 +1,510 +2,425 +5,301 +15,890

Here, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items in Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia relate to a balance from
foreign currency reserves at international Group companies in euro and outstanding foreign currency
reserves in Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia. The reported outstanding foreign currency items in
Kazakhstan tenge exclusively relate to foreign currency reserves at international Group companies in euro.
The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s
perspective, results from the functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall,
based on outstanding foreign currency items as of the balance sheet date, an appreciation or a devaluation
of the respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would
have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A 6.8 million (previous year: A 7.1 million)
or in the amount of earnings of A 6.8 million (previous year: A 7.1 million).

**46.3. Interest rate risks**

STADA is subject to interest risks from financial assets as well as financial debts, primarily in the Euro
zone and Russia.

In order to minimize the effects of significant interest rate fluctuations, STADA manages the interest rate
risk, to the extent possible, for the financial liabilities denominated in euro with hedging transactions. In
financial year 2015, to hedge the interest rate risk, there were cash flow hedges in the form of interest-rate
swaps. Taking into account these hedging transactions, an average of 85% (previous year: 85%) of financial
liabilities denominated in euro and 100% (previous year: 41%) of those denominated in ruble had fixed
interest rates in 2015.

STADA calculates existing interest rate risks using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors are generally included in the calculation:

- changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments in
the context of cash flow hedges,

F-170

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

- changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are
not hedged against interest rate risks, and

- changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

Equity increase (+)/equity reduction (�) from a decrease in the market
interest rate level of 100 basis points . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �0.3 �1.0

**46.4. Default risks**

In addition, STADA may be exposed to a default risk in its operating business or as a result of financing
activities if contracting parties fail to meet their obligations.

To avoid default risks in financing activities respective credit management processes are in place and such
transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing.

Risks of default exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. In addition, there is the risk that in a
difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments
to STADA or business partners of STADA and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks
arise.

STADA therefore strives to maintain business relations only with business partners of impeccable financial
standing and in addition, partly uses suitable measures to safeguard itself against default risk, such as
guarantees, letters of credit, credit insurance or the transfer of assets. However, it cannot be ruled out that
these measures are insufficient and non-payments of individual debtors, and

therefore burdens from one-time special effects, arise to a significant extent. Past due receivables in the
operating area are continuously monitored and potential default risks are anticipated through the creation
of valuation adjustments.

The supply of goods and services to international wholesalers is subject to special monitoring.
Concentrations of risk are assumed if debtors exceed a particular credit volume, for which no securities
were transferred. As of the balance sheet date, however, there are no significant concentrations of risks at
STADA.

STADA’s maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amounts of the financial assets
recognized. In addition, STADA granted guarantees, which amounted to a total nominal volume of
A 25.3 million (previous year: A 25.3 million) as of the balance sheet date (see Note 43.). STADA has
various forms of collateral for credit securities such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees,
assignments of receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for
certain markets and customers.

**46.5. Liquidity risks**

The Group’s liquidity was guaranteed at all times in financial year 2015. In the context of continuous
liquidity planning, the cash flows of all companies are regularly monitored. In order to secure the financial
flexibility and financial security of STADA, a liquidity reserve in the form of cash is held and supplemented
by free credit lines. For this purpose, STADA regularly concludes bilateral credit contracts for a period of
at least 12 months with various banks. The refinancing of the financial liabilities is consequently monitored
in the context of continuous liquidity planning.

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

**46.6. Other price risks**

In the context of a hypothetical risk assessment, there are also other price change risks related to market
prices. However, as of the balance sheet date, STADA does not recognize available-for-sale financial
assets, whose fair values are determined based on market prices, anymore.

**46.7. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

STADA counters risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are
exclusively used to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial
transactions and investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation
purposes.

In financial year 2015, there are cash flow hedges exclusively in the form of payer interest rate swaps. Here,
variable interest payments are transformed into fixed interest payments and the cash flow risk of variable
interest liabilities is thus hedged. In the context of these hedging relationships, interest rate related cash
flow changes of the hedged items are netted with cash flow changes of interest rate swaps.

In financial year 2015, no new payer interest-rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in order to
secure interest payments from promissory note loans.

The total volume of currency and interest rate related derivatives is comprised as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2015** **Dec. 31, 2014**
**in E 000s** **Nominal value** **Fair value** **Nominal value** **Fair value**

**Derivatives without hedging relationship**

The terms of the cash flow hedges existing as of the balance sheet date end in 2016.

All hedges are assumed to be highly effective as the important features are nearly identical (critical terms
match). As of the balance sheet date, all of the hedging relationships presented above were effective. All
changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments were therefore recognized directly in equity
under ‘‘Provisions for cash flow hedges’’. In financial year 2015, the resulting earnings amounted to
A 1.1 million after consideration of deferred taxes (previous year: A 1.5 million).

**46.8. Disclosures on capital management**

The objectives of the STADA capital management are the safeguarding of the business operation, the
creation of a solid equity base for financing profitable growth as well as guaranteeing attractive dividend
payments and the capital service. The STADA capital management consistently aims for the Group
companies to have an equity basis that corresponds to the local requirements. When implementing and
checking the Group’s capital and liquidity the legal requirements are taken into account.

Capital is monitored on the basis of net debt, which results from current and non-current financial
liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents as well as available-for-sale securities. An important key figure
for capital management at STADA is the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which amounted to 3.1 in
financial year 2015 (previous year: 3.1).

**47. Related party transactions**

In the scope of the ordinary course of business, STADA Arzneimittel AG and/or its consolidated
companies have entered into related party transactions. In accordance with IAS 24, ‘‘related parties’’ refers
to directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries that are not consolidated due to lack of material
significance, associates and joint ventures as well as persons in key positions and their close relatives. In
principle, all trades are settled with related companies and natural persons at market-rate conditions.

**47.1. Transactions with related persons**

Persons in key positions are the board members of STADA Arzneimittel AG, the remuneration of whom,
including further information on the principles of the remuneration system, is presented in detail in the
Management Report (see ‘‘Remuneration Report’’), as well as the summary in Note 47. in relation to
quantitative disclosures.

In the course of their normal professional activities, individual members of the Supervisory and Advisory
Boards who are self-employed have business relations with STADA. These are not significant as regards
volume and nature.

**AUDITOR’S REPORT**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by STADA Arzneimittel
Aktiengesellschaft, Bad Vilbel, comprising the balance sheet, the income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, the cash flow statement and the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, together with the group management report for the business year from
January 1 to December 31, 2015. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315a Abs. (paragraph) 1 HGB (‘‘Handelsgesetzbuch’’: German
Commercial Code) are the responsibility of the legal representatives of the company. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and on the group management report
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and
German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of net assets, financial
position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with
reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit
procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting related internal control system and the evidence
supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are
examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit.

The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the
determination of the entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements and the group management report.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the consolidated financial statements comply with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a
Abs. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of
the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and
suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**General Information**

**1. Corporate information**

STADA Arzneimittel Aktiengesellschaft (STADA Arzneimittel AG) as parent company of the STADA
Group (hereafter referred to as ‘‘STADA’’), based in Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is an
internationally oriented company based in Germany, which is active worldwide in the health care and
pharmaceuticals market, especially in the core segments of Generics and Branded Products.

The consolidated financial statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2014 were approved
for publication by the Executive Board on March 23, 2015.

**2. Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements prepared for STADA Arzneimittel AG as parent company as of
December 31, 2014, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union
(EU), as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the
German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies
included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the consolidated financial
statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their maturities.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
notes are shown in euro thousands (A 000s). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2014, STADA observed and, if relevant applied the following pronouncements or
amendments to pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which were first
applicable in financial year 2014, which had no or no significant effect on the presentation of STADA’s
business, financial, earnings situation or cash flow:

- **IAS 32 ‘‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’’:**

The amendment clarifies requirements for the netting of financial assets and financial liabilities on the
balance sheet. The right to netting on the balance sheet must exist as of the balance sheet date.

- **IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of Assets’’:**

The amendment contains a clarification that the reporting of a recoverable amount is only required of
those cash-generating units for which an impairment loss or reversal has been recognized within the
current reporting period.

- **IAS 39 ‘‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’’:**

In order to improve the transparency and regulatory supervision of OTC derivatives, companies are,
in certain circumstances, required to clear derivatives to central counterparties. Despite novation,
derivatives can remain designated as hedging instruments under certain conditions.

- **IFRIC 21 ‘‘Levies’’:**

The standard concerns the question of the accounting of public levies which do not represent income
tax in the sense of IAS 12 and clarifies when the obligation to pay such levies should be recognized as
a liability in the financial statements.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued)**

In May 2011, the IASB adopted the new standards IFRS 10 ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements’’, IFRS 11
‘‘Joint Arrangements’’ and IFRS 12 ‘‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’’. IFRS 10 replaces the
consolidation requirements of the former IAS 27 ‘‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’’ and
SIC-12 ‘‘Consolidation—Special Purpose Entities’’ and introduces a uniform consolidation model for all
subsidiaries. IFRS 11 governs the accounting for joint operations and joint ventures and thus replaces
IAS 31 ‘‘Interests in Joint Ventures’’ and SIC-13 ‘‘Jointly Controlled Entities—Non-Monetary
Contributions by Venturers’’. The former option to proportionately consolidate joint ventures is eliminated
in favor of mandatory application of the equity method. In the context of IFRS 12, disclosure requirements
for subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated special purpose entities are combined,
expanded and replaced. The new regulations, which were adopted in European law in 2012, are applicable
in the EU to financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. In June 2012, IASB published transition
guidance adopted into European law in April 2013 (amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12) for
the standards adopted in May 2011 of IFRS 10 ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements’’, IFRS 11 ‘‘Joint
Arrangements’’ and IFRS 12 ‘‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’’. In the context of these
amendments, the transition guidance in IFRS 10 was clarified and additional simplification was ensured in
all three standards. The significant change here results from IFRS 11 ‘‘Joint Arrangements’’. Joint
ventures, which have been proportionately consolidated to date, are to be accounted for using the equity
method as of financial year 2014, as well as retrospectively in the context of adjusting previous year figures.
The proportionate share of assets and liabilities of these companies will thereby no longer be included in
the consolidated balance sheet and the proportionate share of aggregated earnings of these units will be
disclosed under one item within the income statement, whereas a disclosure was to be made under the
relevant income and expense items in accordance with currently valid regulations.

For STADA, the initial application of the new standards has resulted in retroactively applicable changes in
relation to the consolidation of joint ventures in accordance with IFRS 11. Up until the time of its change
in status to subsidiary in the past financial year, STADA Vietnam, previously consolidated on a pro rata
basis, was included in STADA’s consolidated financial statements retroactively according to the equity
method up until the time control was acquired by STADA in accordance with IFRS 11 in connection with
IAS 8 and in connection with IAS 1. As a result of the consolidation of this company as a subsidiary in the
context of the control achieved over STADA Vietnam as of the fourth quarter of 2013, there were no more
joint ventures within the scope of consolidation of STADA as of December 31, 2013. As a result, there
have been no effects for STADA in financial year 2014 as a result of this changed accounting policy.

In addition, STADA did not apply a number of further pronouncements and amendments to
pronouncements that were adopted by the IASB, the application of which, however, was not mandatory in
financial year 2014.

In May 2014, IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs the revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular
replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The adoption into European law is still
pending. The impact of the new standard for revenue recognition on the business, financial and earnings
situation is still currently under review.

From today’s perspective no or no significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected
from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

With the exception of the changed accounting policies listed in Note 3, there were no changes to
accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of STADA’s business, financial and
earnings situation or cash flow in financial year 2014.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies are included in the consolidated
financial statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by STADA and
are therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if STADA Arzneimittel AG or its subsidiaries are in control
of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to
substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of
voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the consolidated
financial statements using the equity method.

As a result of changing the status of the company STADA Vietnam J.V. Co., Ltd., which was previously
consolidated as a joint venture and as a result of the deconsolidation of STADA Import/Export in financial
year 2013, there were no longer any joint ventures in STADA’s scope of consolidation. The consolidation of
STADA Vietnam J.V. Co., Ltd. is carried out regardless of their capital share of 50% as a subsidiary due to
the fact that STADA controls this company on the basis of agreements in accordance with corporate law.

Associated companies are companies over which STADA is able to exercise significant influence and are
not subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the equity method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on
the business, financial and earnings situation of the STADA Group is insignificant, are not consolidated or
accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for either at fair
value or at amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet total of these
companies make up less than 1% of total Group sales and the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associated companies included in financial year 2014 and are as follows:

**Number of companies in the scope of consolidation** **Germany** **outside** **Total**

**January 1,2014 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **12** **65** **77**

Changes in the scope of consolidation as of December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013
resulted from the merger of the consolidated subsidiary S.A. Neocare N.V., Brussels, Belgium, with S.A.
Eurogenerics N.V., Brussels, Belgium, also a consolidated subsidiary, in the second quarter of 2014.

This did not have any effect on the Group’s business, financial and earnings situation.

Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2014, the contract for the purchase of the Russian branded product
portfolio Aqualor� was completed as planned. The Aqualor� product sales have been consolidated in the
STADA Group since March 1,2014. In this context, STADA’s Russian subsidiary 000 Aqualor has also been
included in the scope of consolidation of STADA Arzneimittel AG.

In addition, the Chinese subsidiary STADA Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Ltd., Beijing, China, has been
included in the scope of consolidation of STADA as of January 1, 2014.

These changes also did not have any significant effect on the Group’s business, financial and earnings
situation.

Furthermore, the British company Internis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., London, United Kingdom, which had
been previously acquired, was included as a subsidiary in the scope of consolidation of STADA in the
fourth quarter of 2014. For details on the impact of this merger on STADA’s consolidated financial
statements see Note 8.

**5. Scope of consolidation (Continued)**

As in the previous year, the aforementioned chart includes BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which is
included in the consolidated financial statements as an associated company according to the equity
method. STADA holds 15.86% of the shares in this company. The significant influence is therefore not
directly due to the amount of shares held, but instead is related in particular to the identity of part of the
management personnel between BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and STADA Arzneimittel AG.
Details on the relationship between BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and STADA are included in the
Notes on related party disclosures (see Note 48.2.).

As in the previous year, the aforementioned chart also includes both French companies Pharm Ortho

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the
acquisition costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the
acquiree, STADA recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the
acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a revaluation through
profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares of non-controlling
interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
directly in equity in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables and payables, expenses and income, as well as
earnings between the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are eliminated,

F-196

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies**
**(Continued)**

intercompany value adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in
deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax
liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associated companies are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the
date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established
(associated company) and carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of
earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is
recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associated company. A negative
difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associated
companies. Profit and loss from transactions with associated companies is recognized in the consolidated
financial statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IAS 39 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associated company.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of STADA Arzneimittel AG is the euro and represents the reporting currency of
the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing
rate and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

The translation of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements with a functional
currency other than the euro into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the
resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the
period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in
equity in the ‘‘Provisions for currency translation’’. These provisions are released and recognized in income
if Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

The exchange rate development of currencies important to STADA to the euro can be seen in the
following chart:

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**8. Business combinations**

In financial year 2014, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for
which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in more detail below.

In the second quarter of 2014, STADA purchased the production and distribution rights for the branded
product portfolio Flexitol� including the associated sales structures from the LaCorium group of
companies. STADA achieved control upon conclusion of the contract on June 16, 2014.

The purchase price for the acquisition of the production and distribution rights including the associated
sales structures totaled GBP 8.3 million (approx. A 10.3 million) including adjustments for inventory in the
amount of GBP 1.7 million (approx. A 2.2 million), and was completely paid in cash or cash equivalents.
The acquired product portfolio comprises 15 prescription-free (OTC) and prescribable (OTX) products in
the area of hand and foot care.

In the context of the purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of approx. A 1 resulted from the
business combination and is broken down as follows:

**in E million**

Purchase price for 100% of the shares in the production and distribution rights approx. . . . . . . . 10.3
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired incl. fair value of adjustments for
inventory approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.3
**Goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **0.0**

For the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the context of the business combination, the following
fair values were recognized at the acquisition date:

**Fair values in E million**

Intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.5
Inventories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.8

**Assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **13.3**

Trade accounts payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0

**Liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **3.0**

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the measurement of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

Sales generated in the market region Central Europe with the branded product portfolio Flexitol� since
the acquisition date amounted to approx. A 2 million in financial year 2014. The operating profit of this
business combination adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (approx. A 0.3 million)
amounted to approx. A 1 million in financial year 2014. If STADA had acquired the branded product
portfolio Flexitol� on January 1, 2014, sales of approx. A 4 million and operating profit, adjusted for effects
from the purchase price allocation (about A 0.6 million), of approx. A 2 million would have been achieved
on a linear extrapolation in financial year 2014.

Another significant business combination resulted in the context of acquiring the British company Internis
Pharmaceuticals Limited, London, United Kingdom, which is active in the prescription area of therapeutic
treatment of vitamin D3 deficiency. STADA achieved control upon conclusion of the contract on
December 19, 2014.

The purchase price amounts to a maximum of GBP 49.0 million (applying the exchange rate at the date of
acquisition approx. A 62.3 million) and was completely paid in cash or cash equivalents. It contains certain
contingent purchase price components. The conditional purchase price components amount to a total of
GBP 20.0 million and divide equally into two purchase price conditions. The first purchase price condition
is to obtain regulatory drug approval. The final purchase price is determined by the date of achieving the
approval. The determination of the final purchase price of the second purchase price component depends
on certain changes regarding competitive parameters and determined sales targets. The amount

F-198

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**8. Business combinations (Continued)**

recognized as of the acquisition date for conditional consideration amounts to GBP 20.0 million. It is very
likely that the regulatory drug approval will be obtained at an early date and, therefore, the competitive
parameters will not have changed at that time. A range of GBP 0 to 20.0 million is assumed for the
conditional purchase price components, while the risk of a deviation of GBP 20.0 million is estimated as
very low. As of the balance sheet date, GBP 39.0 million had been already paid.

Due to the short amount of time between the acquisition and the balance sheet date, the entire purchase
price allocation for this business combination is to be regarded as provisional. In the context of the
preliminary purchase price allocation, goodwill in the amount of approx. A 8.9 million resulted from the
business combination and is broken down as follows:

**in E million**

Purchase price for 100% of the shares of the company approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62.3
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approx. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 53.4
**Goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **8.9**

Goodwill here results primarily from the expansion of the presence in the market region Central Europe,
from taking over a highly qualified workforce and from a possible expansion of the sales activities in the
market region Central Europe.

For the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the context of the business combination, the following
preliminary fair values were recognized at the acquisition date:

**Fair values in E million**

Intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63.0

Deferred tax liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.1
Other non-current liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.3
Other current liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.0

**Liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **19.4**

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the measurement of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

Sales generated in the market region Central Europe with the company Internis since the acquisition date
amounted to approx. A 0.4 million in financial year 2014. The operating profit of this business combination
adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (approx. A 0.0 million) amounted to approx.
A 0.1 million in financial year 2014. If STADA had acquired the company on January 1, 2014, sales of
approx. A 13 million and operating profit, adjusted for effects from the purchase price allocation (about
A 2 million), of approx. A 5 million would have been achieved on linear extrapolation in financial year 2014.

**9. Accounting policies**

STADA’s consolidated financial statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these
are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the consolidated
financial statements and which are described in more detail below.

**Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered, provided that it is reasonably**
probable that measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that the substantial risks and
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. It must also be possible to reliably measure the
Company’s own costs incurred or to be incurred.

F-199


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

Sales are recognized before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions (rebates or discounts) at fair
value of the consideration received or receivable. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties
are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience
regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined
as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction
on sales based on the respective contract in force.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses
related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods
(e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead costs (e.g. depreciation of production equipment
and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value adjustments of excess or obsolete inventories.

**Research expenses are costs that are incurred in relation to the research activity of a company that aims to**
provide new scientific or technical findings. The product portfolio of the STADA Group continues to focus
on products that do not require the Group to conduct its own research. Just as in the previous years, no
research expenses were thus incurred in financial year 2014.

**Development expenses consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process at STADA is to obtain national or multinational
regulatory drug approval. Development costs relative to approvals for new drugs obtained by STADA
result in capitalization as intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to
become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability exist as well as the necessary resources to complete the asset and to use or
sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It must be possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

STADA immediately recognizes development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense in the periods
in which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
sold.

**Interest income is reported in the income statement as a component of financial income. In this regard, both**
interest income and interest expenses for all financial instruments measured at amortized cost as well as
interest-bearing financial assets classified as available for sale are recognized on the basis of the effective
interest rate.

**Dividends received from companies not included in the consolidated financial statements are disclosed**
within the investment income. This shall be recognized when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is
established.

**Income taxes include actual taxes on income as well as deferred taxes. The tax receivables and liabilities**
recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and outside
Germany from financial year 2014 as well as from previous years, if applicable. The tax receivables and
liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the balance sheet date or known and
already concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable income is generated.

Deferred taxes are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities and
their valuation rate in the IFRS financial statements as well as for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will result against which the

F-200


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences
taxable in the future. STADA determines deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the balance
sheet date or those that have already been resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax
receivables and liabilities are offset if these relate to the same taxation authority.

The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that
are recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with
an effect on deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
aggregated into market regions below the segment level, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a
market region within the three operating segments of the STADA Group for the purpose of an impairment
test of goodwill.

STADA carries out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also
take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount
of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in
use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions which are taken in
order to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory
conditions, investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions
are taken individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly
based on internally determined assumptions which reflect both past experience and include external
market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. If on the balance sheet date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the
recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the
difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist,
corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of
these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royally
method. At STADA, this affects the umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in the context of the acquisition
of the Hemofarm group, as well as the umbrella brand Pymepharco capitalized in the context of achieving
control over Pymepharco. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through
annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether
the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized
development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of
individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs.
Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally
20 years).

F-201

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance which do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied at STADA due to a lack of
relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are
reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each balance sheet date, STADA assesses whether
indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for various market regions with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under ‘‘Other expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units within the STADA Group are defined at the level of individual assets within the
reportable segments of Branded Products, Generics and Commercial Business.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Leases are classified either as operating lease or as finance lease, depending on whether the significant**
risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor or with the lessee. The lease is not recognized in the
lessee’s balance sheet in case of operating leases. STADA records the lease payments for these leases in
the income over the lease term. Assets from finance leasing are, on initial recognition, recognized at the
lower of the fair value of the lease and the present value of minimum lease payments, and are depreciated
according to their estimated useful lives or shorter contractual period. An amount is reported as lease
liability, when, on initial recognition, it corresponds to the lease’s carrying amount and is extinguished and
carried forward in subsequent periods with a constant effective interest rate. The interest that is part of the
lease installment is recognized as an expense.

In addition, in case of sale and leaseback transactions that represent a finance lease, any excess of sales
proceeds over the carrying amount is deferred and recognized in the income statement over the lease term.

The total value of capitalized leases is not of material significance for STADA when compared with the
total volume of fixed assets.

Under **financial assets, STADA recognizes shares in non-consolidated, affiliated companies, other**
investments as well as held-to-maturity securities. Shares in associated companies and other investments
are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are generally reported at fair value with no effect on
income. If no quoted market prices in an active market are available to measure these shares and their fair
value therefore cannot be determined reliably, they are measured at amortized cost. If any objective
indications of impairment are determined, these are quantified by means of an impairment test and
recognized in profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods),**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at
the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs are calculated based on weighted average costs. Costs of
sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and overheads that can be allocated to the
production process, including reasonable depreciation on production facilities. Financing costs are not
included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. Net realizable value is
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be broken down into the following categories in accordance with IAS 39: loans and**
receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and
held-to-maturity investments. Financial assets are accounted for and measured pursuant to IAS 39.
Accordingly, financial assets are, as a rule, initially recognized at fair value. In addition, for financial assets
which are subsequently measured at amortized cost, transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition are to be taken into account. Different measurement policies apply for subsequent
measurement in accordance with the applicable categories for financial assets pursuant to IAS 39.

**Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not**
quoted in an active market. They are allocated to current assets to the extent that they are due for
settlement within twelve months after the balance sheet date. STADA reports loans and receivables under
‘‘Trade accounts receivable’’, ‘‘Other financial assets’’ and ‘‘Cash and cash equivalents’’. They are
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

STADA reports receivables from derivatives which, if applicable, may also be part of hedge accounting, as
**financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Assets in this category are reported under the ‘‘Other**
financial assets’’ item. They are measured at fair value. If these assets do not have a quoted market price in
an active market, fair value is determined with appropriate measurement models. This includes the
application of discounted cash flow methods, which are largely based on input parameters observable in
the market. Changes in the fair values are recognized in profit and loss at the time of the increase or
decrease in value.

**Held-to-maturity financial investments include non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments**
and a fixed term that STADA intends to hold to maturity. They are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. STADA reports these assets in financial assets under the item ‘‘Other financial
assets’’.

**Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative assets that are not allocated to any of the above**
categories. In particular, they comprise, in addition to shares in affiliated companies and other investments
included in financial assets, equity securities which are recognized under ‘‘Other financial assets’’. They are
measured at fair value, with recognition of changes under ‘‘Provisions available for sale’’ directly in equity.
These measurement results are reclassified through profit and loss upon sale or valuation allowance of
these assets. There must be objective evidence that there is a significant or continuing decrease in fair
value below cost. Usually, published price quotations can be used for determining fair value.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the
expected default risk, STADA determines the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by
debtor. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of
receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to
be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment thus determined
reduces the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are classified as held for sale, if the related carrying**
amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and if
the sale is regarded as highly probable. Measurement of these assets is based on the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

**Cash and cash equivalents include cash and call deposits as well as short-term and highly liquid financial**
investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date, which can be converted to cash
immediately and are subject only to minor price fluctuation risks. They are measured at amortized cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are reported in accordance with their definition in IAS 7.

Other assets, which are not based on any contractual rights involving the direct or indirect exchange of
cash, are recognized under the item other assets.

STADA maintains defined benefit plans in various countries, according to which the amount of pension
benefits depends on the employees’ pensionable remuneration and the length of their service or which
contain guarantees not permitting recognition as defined contribution plan. **Pension obligations are**
measured in accordance with actuarial principles of the projected unit credit method. The pension
provisions recognized in the balance sheet correspond to the present value of the defined benefit
obligation on the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets adjusted for the effect resulting from
any effect of limiting the benefit asset. The calculation includes, apart from earned pensions and
entitlements, future salary and pension increases as well. For German Group companies, pension
obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2005G mortality
tables. Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to
individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on market yields on high quality corporate
bonds with fixed interest rates at the end of the reporting period. In countries where there is no deep
market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on
government bonds.

The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized directly in equity. It
differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions, due to changes in
financial assumptions as well as due to experience-based amendments. They are recognized directly in
equity in the period in which they occur (‘‘Other comprehensive income’’). The relevant amounts are
reported separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the calculation of the
portion of the interest income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, the standard IAS 19
requires the application of the discount rate underlying the obligation. The remainder of the actual income
from plan assets is to be recognized directly in other comprehensive income. The current service cost is
recorded in staff costs of the individual functional areas. All past service cost that arises in the financial
year shall be recognized immediately through profit or loss.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements
or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans
are recognized as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas.

The **other non-current provisions contain anniversary provisions as other long-term employee benefits.**
Commitments to anniversary payments are recognized in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 as other
long-term employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not
recognized without an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately
recognized as income or expenditure in the relevant functional area. Furthermore, there is a working time
accounts plan which is accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.

**Other provisions are made by STADA if there are current legal or constructive obligations to third parties**
arising from past events and probably can lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
that can be reliably determined. An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered as
probable if it is more likely than not. Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into
account all recognizable risks, offers the best possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the
obligations. Any existing reimbursement claims by third parties are not netted with other provisions.
Expenses from the creation of provisions are allocated to functional costs according to where they arise. If

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

changes in estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other provisions are reversed on a pro rata
basis and recognized in profit and loss under the item where the original expense was recognized.

STADA reports all other provisions as current liabilities, because a settlement date within twelve months
of the balance date is expected. The amounts recognized are not discounted. Liabilities incurred due to
outstanding accounts or obligations vis-`a-vis personnel and tax authorities, as well as other liabilities are
not recorded as provisions, but under ‘‘Trade accounts payable’’ or ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

Differentiated from provisions, there are contingent liabilities for possible obligations based on past events
but which will not become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are
not under STADA’s control. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for
which however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the
obligation cannot be adequately estimated. In accordance with IAS 37, such contingent liabilities are not
recognized.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values that are not part of an
effective hedging relationship and allocated to the category ‘‘at fair value through profit or loss’’ in
accordance with IAS 39. STADA reports these liabilities in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item. Here,
those derivative financial instruments are also included which serve to hedge interest rate and currency
risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments, and which are also
measured at fair value in accordance with the regulations of IAS 39 on hedge accounting. Unless market
prices are available, fair value is determined with measurement models based on discounted cash flow
models.

**Derivative financial instruments exist at STADA in the context of derivatives measured at fair value with an**
effect on income as well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. In each case, depending on
whether the market value of the derivatives is positive or negative, they are recognized under the item
‘‘Other financial assets’’ or ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ (see accounting policies for financial assets and
financial liabilities). Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging instruments in the context of hedge accounting
in accordance with IAS 39.

At STADA, cash flow hedges are used to hedge against fluctuations of cash flows associated with a
recognized asset or a recognized liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the fair
value of these hedging instruments are recognized in the amount of the effective part of the hedging
relationship directly in equity under ‘‘Provisions for cash flow hedges’’. A transfer to the income statement
takes place in the period when the underlying hedged item becomes effective. The ineffective part of the
changes in value is, however, recognized directly in the income statement.

In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of recognized assets or recognized
liabilities or fixed off balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions
are recorded in profit and loss like changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. If the
requirements for hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously hedged items
are adjusted on the basis of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign operation are
treated according to the same accounting policies as cash flow hedges.

STADA regularly reviews the effectiveness of the hedging relationships as a prerequisite for hedge
accounting pursuant to IAS 39. A hedging transaction is in general considered to be effective, if changes in
fair value of the hedging transaction are both prospectively and retrospectively within a range of 80% to
125% of the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item.

STADA measures all other financial liabilities, in particular trade accounts payable as well as financial
liabilities, at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

STADA has so far not made use of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as
financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

Other liabilities, which are not based on any contractual rights involving the direct or indirect exchange of
cash, are recognized under the item ‘‘Other liabilities’’.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the business, financial and earnings situation in the consolidated financial statements
is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, STADA makes estimates and
assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are
considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are
constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual circumstances. The significant
estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed
below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets valuated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this, which are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

STADA carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units aggregated to market regions below the segment level, which are
based on certain assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. The discounted cash flow method is
used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a
detailed planning period of three years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year
detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term
inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some
uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal developments and developments in the health care market,
as well as the parameters determined in the context of current market information but also as a best
possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and
despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent
years.

For items of properly plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are recognized as advance payments, the
growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of
active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment
tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
situation of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction.
In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income
tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to
IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of
assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding
effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group
in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the STADA Group is being allotted to
a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of
non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of

corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a
Group guideline.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’ are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the balance sheet date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension expenses.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and
a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success. The determination of
provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates, which can change due to new
information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for warranties may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements, which are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

STADA’s sales primarily result from the supply of products. For information on the reporting of sales,
please refer to the details included in Accounting Policies.

In 2014, the increase in sales compared to 2013 was primarily a result of the good sales development in the
market regions Central Europe and Asia & Pacific. This development was mainly characterized by the
acquisition of the British OTC supplier Thornton & Ross as well as the consolidations of the Vietnamese
company STADA Vietnam and the Chinese company STADA Pharmaceuticals (Beijing). Exchange rate
effects and portfolio changes had a total influence of A 47.3 million on sales in the reporting year. For
information on how sales are broken down according to segments and market regions, please refer to
Segment Reporting in Note 43.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in E 000s** **2014** **2013[(1)]**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 853,464 834,810

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**12. Cost of sales (Continued)**

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A 100.8 million (previous year[(1)]:
A 86.3 million) mainly inlcudes depreciation and amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which
represents a necessary condition for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug
approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with
reversals. The reversals amounted to A 9.3 million in financial year 2014 (previous year[(1)]: A 7.3 million).

**13. Selling expenses**

Selling expenses comprise in addition to the costs for sales departments and sales force also the costs for
advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics
that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts
in kind,—if possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not included. The resulting
expenses are recognized as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing expenses in the amount of A 186.4 million (previous year[(1)]:
A 196.6 million) corresponded to a share of 41% in selling expenses (previous year[(1)]: 40%). In addition,
selling expenses included depreciation in the amount of A 7.4 million (previous year: A 7.7 million).

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2014, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A 10.2 million
(previous year[(1)]: A 10.6 million).

General and administrative expenses decreased in the reporting year by a total of A 6.7 million. The
decrease was a result of net earnings in the amount of A 15.9 million, primarily from past service cost, in
connection with a change in the defined benefit plan for the Chairman of the Executive Board and the
resulting changes with regard to the benefits awarded according to the former benefit plan.

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details
included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2014, research and development expenses increased by A 1.4 million compared to the
previous year.

The research and development expenses include depreciation in the amount of A 2.6 million (previous
year[(1)]: A 2.6 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A 27.5 million (previous year:
A 18.8 million) were capitalized in financial year 2014 (see the note on the item ‘‘Intangible assets’’).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

**in E 000s** **2014** **2013[(1)]**

Income in connection with business combinations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 36,831

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**16. Other income (Continued)**

The income in connection with business combinations in the previous year resulted from the control
achieved over the Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies Pymepharco and STADA Vietnam and the
related purchase price allocations, including effects from the dissolution of the respective provisions for
currency translation. In connection with the acquisition of the British OTC supplier Thornton & Ross,
furthermore, negative goodwill was recognized from the purchase price allocation for this business
combination in the previous year. No such income was recognized in financial year 2014.

The remaining other income includes such items as income from damage claim payments received and
other income not directly associated with functional costs, which comprises many insignificant individual
items in the Group companies.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

**in E 000s** **2014** **2013[(1)]**

Expenses from valuation allowances on accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,809 9,388
Losses on the disposal of non-current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 521
Currency translation expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29,415 16,535
Impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47,723 23,617
Impairment losses on goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59,808 —
Remaining other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14,488 22,568

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **155,243** **72,629**

Expenses for valuation allowances on accounts receivable were recognized netted with the corresponding
income from their reversal.

Other expenses include impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill in the amount of
A 47.7 million (previous year: A 23.6 million). In addition, impairment losses on goodwill regarding the
market regions CIS/Eastern Europe as well as Asia/Pacific & MENA were recorded in the reporting year.
These impairment losses were considered by STADA as a special effect of financial year 2014.

The item also included net currency translation expenses in the amount of A 29.4 million in the reporting
year (previous year[(1)]: A 16.5 million). This development is especially attributable to the strong devaluation
of the significant currencies of the market region CIS/Eastern Europe and the resulting currency
translation expenses, which are reported as one-time special effects.

Within remaining other expenses, personnel expenses are recognized in the amount of A 5,8 million
(previous year: A 9.4 million).

**18. Expenses in connection with the ‘‘STADA—build the future’’ project**

Expenses in connection with the ‘‘STADA—build the future’’ project, which were reported as special
effects and recorded separately in the consolidated income statement since financial year 2010, amounted
to A 9.1 million in the previous year and primarily included burdens from external consulting services,
related follow-up projects as well as unscheduled personnel expenses in the framework of this project.

In financial year 2014, no expenses were incurred in connection with the ‘‘STADA—build the future’’
project, as it was successfully concluded at the end of financial year 2013.

**19. Financial result**

The **result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2014 relates to the companies**
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS, which are accounted for
using the equity method. In the previous year, this also related—in the context of the retrospective
adjustments carried out in accordance with the new standard IFRS 11—to the Vietnamese company
STADA Vietnam, which has been consolidated as subsidiary since the fourth quarter of 2013.

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2014 includes an interest expense from other non-current
provisions, which comprises interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from pension
obligations and other non-current provisions, in the amount of A 2.0 million (previous year: A 2.0 million).

In financial year 2014, the Group refinanced itself at interest rates of between 0.9% p.a. and 12.0% p.a.
(previous year: between 0.8% p.a. and 13.8% p.a.). On the balance sheet date of December 31, 2014, the
weighted average interest rate for non-current financial liabilities was approx. 3.3% p.a. (previous year:
approx. 3.5% p.a.) and for current financial liabilities approx. 4.6% p.a. (previous year: approx. 2.1% p.a.).
For all of the Group’s financial liabilities the weighted average interest amounted to approx. 3.7% p.a.
(previous year: approx. 3.3% p.a.).

Interest payments partially resulting from interest rate swaps designated by STADA as hedging
instruments in cash flow hedges are not netted for each swap contract and are recognized as interest
income or interest expense in the valuation category of the associated underlying hedged item. For the
reporting period, this exclusively concerns financial liabilities which are valued at amortized costs.

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A 0.7 million in financial
year 2014 (previous year: A 0.5 million). A capitalization rate of 3.1% for intangible assets (previous year:
3.6%) was taken as a basis.

Other financial income and other financial expenses consist of the following:

The result from the measurement of financial instruments in the reporting period resulted from interest
rate swaps and interest rate/currency swaps measured at fair value through profit or loss. There was a net
relief on earnings in the amount of A 3.6 million before or A 3.6 million after taxes. In the previous year,
there was a net relief on earnings from the measurement of derivative financial instruments in the amount
of A 3.4 million before or A 2.5 million after taxes. The measurement of interest rate hedge transactions
thereby depends on the development of the money market interest rate.

The income tax rate amounted to 43.8% for financial year 2014. The income tax rate in the previous year
was 35.1%[(1)].

The following overview explains how the income tax expense reported in the income statement was
calculated from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the weighted expected Group average tax rate on the earnings before taxes and takes into account
for all domestic and foreign companies the respective tax rates depending on their applicable national and
legal forms.

**20. Income taxes (Continued)**

Tax effects from non-deductible impairments of investment and goodwill hereby result mainly from
impairments of goodwill in the market regions CIS/Eastern Europe and Asia/Pacific & MENA.

The expenses not deductible for tax purposes primarily result from the limited tax deductibility of
operating expenses for payments in connection with investments.

Deferred tax liabilities reported by STADA result, among other things, from deferred taxes in the context
of purchase price allocations carried out under IFRS 3. Deferred tax liabilities increased as compared to
the previous year primarily as a result of the acquisition of the British company Internis.

Tax advantages that are highly probable and expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards
are recognized under ‘‘Deferred taxes from loss carryforwards’’.

Tax loss carryforwards are only capitalized if their future utilization is highly probable. Tax loss
carryforwards capitalized as of the December 31, 2014 reporting date amounted to A 60.1 million in
financial year 2014 (previous year: A 54.0 million).

The deduction of operating expenses for interest, which is limited under German tax law (so-called interest
barrier), led to no net interest expense not deductible for tax purposes in 2014 (previous year:
A 25.2 million) and therefore to no additional tax burden (previous year: A 6.1 million).

**20. Income taxes (Continued)**

Income taxes paid or owed increased by a total of A 0.1 million (previous year: reduction by A 1.1 million)
through the utilization of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards from previous years for which no
deferred taxes have been recognized so far and through tax loss carryforwards from the current financial
year for which no deferred taxes have been recognized.

Diluted earnings per share are generally calculated with the formula used to calculate the basic earnings
per share. They are also adjusted for the effect of outstanding share options on the basis of the average
share price of the financial year. This is carried out based on the assumption that all potentially dilutive
share options are exercised. Details on currently valid equity instruments are included in the notes on
equity.

The average number of employees in the reporting year was above the level of the previous year at 10,209
(previous year[(1)]: 8,841). This increase was mainly based on the acquisition of the British OTC supplier
Thornton & Ross as of September 1, 2013 and the control achieved over STADA Vietnam as of
October 10, 2013. Furthermore, the inclusion of STADA Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Ltd., China, in the
scope of consolidation as of January 1, 2014 and an increase in the number of employees at the Serbian
Hemofarm A.D. as a consequence of increased production capacities contributed to this development. On
the balance sheet date, the STADA Group’s number of employees in 2014 totaled 10,363 (previous year:
9,825).

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their
functional relevance, decreased in financial year 2014 to A 305.1 million (previous year[(1)]: A 319.6 million).
The decrease was a result of earnings recorded within personnel expenses from past service cost in
connection with a change in the defined benefit plan for the Chairman of the Executive Board and the
resulting changes with regard to the benefits awarded according to the former benefit plan.

(1) The previous year’s figures have been adjusted in accordance with the new IFRS 11 in connection with IAS 8 as well as in
connection with IAS 1 (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—3.).

(2) In 2013, facility management staff were placed exclusively into the functional area Administration. In 2014, facility
management staff in production were allocated to the functional area Production/Quality management and the remaining
facility management staff were assigned to the functional area Administration.

Eastern Europe as well as of the market region Asia/Pacific & MENA.

The impairments of financial assets in the reporting year primarily relate to the carrying amounts of
STADApharm AB in Sweden. These impairments in the previous year primarily related to the carrying
amounts of IIP Institut f¨ur Industrielle Pharmazie Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH and
STADA Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd.

Depreciation and amortization increased by 12.9% compared to the previous year. More information on
amortization, depreciation and impairment losses is included in the Notes on non-current assets.

Additions from business combinations according to IFRS 3, which relate to the fair values determined in
the context of the purchase price allocations, resulted from the acquisition of the British OTC supplier
Internis with A 72.7 million, as well as from the purchase of the branded product portfolio Flexitol� with
A 12.8 million.

Included in intangible assets in the previous year were software and software licenses in the amount of
A 2.6 million, which were recognized with the present value of the minimum lease payments in accordance
with IAS 17 in the context of a sale-and-leaseback transaction and which have been amortized on schedule.
At the end of the term of the lease contract, an existing purchase option was utilized. The respective assets
have been fully amortized as of the balance sheet date of December 31, 2014.

The umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the Hemofarm
group is included in recognized trademarks as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as STADA
intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2014, it has a carrying amount of A 47.6 million
(previous year: A 50.2 million). The change compared to the previous year figure is a result of different
exchange rates. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2014, a royalty rate of 2% and a
discount rate of 14.2% was used. No necessity for impairment was found for the reporting year.

In the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in the previous year, furthermore, the umbrella
brand Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as
STADA intends to continue the utilization of the trademark. As at December 31, 2014, it has a carrying
amount of A 9.1 million (previous year: A 8.0 million). The change is a result of different exchange rates. In
the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2014, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 16.5%
was used. No necessity for impairment was found for the reporting year.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2014 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A 0.7 million (previous year: A 0.5 million). In financial year

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**25. Intangible assets (Continued)**

2014, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
3.1% (previous year: 3.6%).

Development costs of A 28.7 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A 20.7 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life, generally 20 years. STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization as expense in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year 2014,
these development costs amounted to A 56.9 million (previous year [(1)]: A 55.5 million).

Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is
recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an
amount of A 87.7 million (previous year [(1)]: A 78.1 million).

In financial year 2014, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A 104.8 million (previous year: A 22.6 million). They mainly include impairment on goodwill in the amount
of A 54.0 million and additional intangible assets in the amount of A 22.0 million as a result of the
significantly changed interest rate and currency environment as well as on ongoing higher risks in the
market region CIS/Eastern Europe.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the note on the scope of consolidation
(see Note 5.).

For the purposes of impairment tests for capitalized goodwill, STADA defines cash-generating units as the
respective market regions within the operating segments in accordance with the strategic planning and
control of the Group.

In comparison with the previous year, there were the following significant changes in the carrying amounts
of goodwill:

- The increase in goodwill of the cash-generating unit market region Central Europe, Branded Products
segment, resulted from the acquisition of the British company Internis. In opposition, the
reclassification of goodwill to the market region Asia/Pacific & MENA, Branded Products segment,
due to a change in management responsibility that resulted from a strategic reallocation led to a
reduction in goodwill.

- The decrease in goodwill of the cash-generating unit market region CIS/Eastern Europe, Generics
segment, mainly results from the necessity for impairment in the amount of A 54.0 million as of
December 31, 2014 resulting from an extraordinary impairment test carried out in the reporting year.
The impairment resulted from the aggravation of the economic situation in Russia at the end of the
year, with a massive decline of the Russian ruble and a significant interest increase by the Russian
central bank. The update of the parameters that derived from it, particularly of currency relations,
interest rates and country risks for market conditions as of December 31,2014 led to a value in use of
A 375.4 million, which was below the carrying amount. The additional reduction in goodwill results
from exchange rates changes, in particular from a devaluation of the Russian ruble.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**25. Intangible assets (Continued)**

- The decrease in goodwill of the cash-generating unit market region CIS/Eastern Europe, Branded
Products segment, fully results from exchange rate changes, particularly from a devaluation of the
Russian ruble.

- The increase in goodwill of the cash-generating unit market region Asia/Pacific & MENA, Branded
Products segment, results from the reclassification of goodwill from the market region Central
Europe, Branded Products segment, due to a change in management responsibility that resulted from
a strategic reallocation. In opposition, an impairment in the amount of A 5.8 million resulted from the
impairment tests carried out in the reporting year due to existing knowledge and expectations related
to the market and competitive environment. The value in use of the cash-generating unit as of
September 30, 2014 was at A 70.1 million.

In the context of the regular impairment tests for capitalized goodwill of September 30, 2014, the
discounted cash flow method is used to determine anticipated cash inflows, applying the following
parameters defined for the individual cash-generating units according to segment:

**Growth rates**
**of forward-** **WACCs 2014**
**projection** **WACCs 2014** **WACCs 2014** **Commercial**
**Each relating to segments, defined as cash-generating** **phase 2014** **Generics** **Branded Products** **Business**
**units** **in %** **segment in %** **segment in %** **segment in %**

Market region Germany . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.7% 8.8% 8.9% —
Market region Central Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.7% 11.1% 10.9% —

Market region Asia/Pacific & MENA . . . . . . . 4.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.6%

In the previous year, the applied parameters were as follows:

**Growth rates**
**of forward-** **WACCs 2013**
**projection** **WACCs 2013** **WACCs 2013** **Commercial**
**Each relating to segments, defined as cash-generating** **phase 2013** **Generics** **Branded Products** **Business**
**units** **in %** **segment in %** **segment in %** **segment in %**

Market region Germany . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.9% 8.9% 9.4% —
Market region Central Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.9% 11.2% 11.0% —
Market region CIS/Eastern Europe . . . . . . . . 5.2% 15.5% 15.1% —
Market region Asia & Pacific . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.2% 22.1% 22.0% 23.4%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and mid-term market developments.
For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for the
determination of the value in use is based on assumptions in light of past experience supplemented by
current internal developments and verified through external market data and analyses. The most important
assumptions include the development of future sales prices, amounts and costs, the influence of the
regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth rates. Significant
changes to the above-described assumptions would influence the determination of the value in use of the
cash-generating units. Possible changes to these assumptions would negatively influence the
cash-generating units as a result of continued strong competition and regulatory interventions. The
discount rates applied are determined on the basis of external factors derived from the market and
adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the cash-generating units.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. The following table shows what additional impairments would have come for the

different cash-generating units as a result of a 1.0 percentage point higher discount rate, a decrease in the
growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points:

as a result of the sensitivity analysis.

With a reduction in discount rates of 1.0 percentage points, an increase in the growth rate of
0.5 percentage points and an increase in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points, there would have been the

Due to the massive decline of the Russian ruble since the fourth quarter 2014 and a significant increase of
interest rates by the Russian central bank in December 2014, there were indications for an impairment. For
this reason, an extraordinary impairment test was carried out for the cash-generating unit market region
CIS/Eastern Europe, Generics segment, and for the cash-generating unit market region CIS/Eastern
Europe, Branded Products segment, as of December 31, 2014. The parameters used to determine the value
in use in the scope of the regular impairment test as of September 30, 2014 were updated, particularly
regarding currency relations, interest rates as well as country risks for current market conditions, as of the
new balance sheet date.

The discounted cash flow method was used to determine the anticipated cash inflows, applying the
following parameters defined for the individual cash-generating units according to segment:

**Growth rates** **WACCs 2014**
**forward** **WACCs 2014** **WACCs 2014** **Commercial**
**projected** **Generics** **Branded Products** **Business**

Market region CIS/ Eastern Europe . . . . . . 4.0 16.7 16.7 —

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. The following table shows what additional impairments would have come for the
market region CIS/Eastern Europe as a result of a 1.0 percentage point higher discount rate, a decrease in
the growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points:

**WACC** **Growth rates** **EBIT**

(1) The previous year’s figures have been adjusted in accordance with the new IFRS 11 in connection with IAS 8 as well as in
connection with IAS 1 (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—3.).

In the previous year, investments in associates decreased due to the control achieved as of January 1, 2013
of the subsidiary Pymepharco, which was previously included in the consolidated financial statements as an
associated company and has been consolidated as a subsidiary as of 2013. In addition, the decrease in
financial year 2013 resulted from the control achieved over Vietnamese company STADA Vietnam,
which—in the context of the retrospective adjustments carried out in accordance with the new standard
IFRS 11—was measured at equity up until the time control was acquired and has been consolidated as a
subsidiary since the fourth quarter of 2013.

**32. Inventories**

Inventories can be subdivided as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2014** **Dec. 31, 2013**

Materials and supplies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 93,958 106,133

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **498,785** **524,374**

The decrease in inventories primarily resulted from a weak Russian ruble and a corresponding low
translation of assets reported in foreign currency into the Group currency euro as well as from reporting
date effects.

In financial year 2014, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of
inventories in the amount of A 33.7 million (previous year[(1)]: A 29.9 million), which were already deducted
from the amounts shown above through profit and loss. In financial year 2014, reversals here amounted to
A 9.3 million (previous year[(1)]: A 7.3 million).

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale**

In financial year 2014, assets held for sale in the amount of A 0.3 million (previous year: A 1.6 million)
included real estate of a STADA subsidiary in Serbia. Thereof, A 0.2 million (previous year: A 1.3 million) is
allocated to the Generics operating segment and A 0.1 million to the Branded Products operating segment
(previous year: A 0.3 million).

**34. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as short-term and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subjected to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the
respective national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash
equivalents extending beyond this do not exist.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents from A 126.2 million as of December 31, 2013 to A 164.2 million
as of December 31,2014 is primarily due to reporting date effects. Further details on the development of
cash and cash equivalents can be found in the consolidated cash flow statement.

**35. Equity and liabilities**

Group equity amounted to A 903.3 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: A 1,010.1 million).
This corresponds to an equity-to-assets ratio of 27.1% (previous year: 29.6%).

**35.1. Share capital**

As of December 31, 2014, share capital amounted to A 157,629,420.00 (December 31, 2013:
A 157,150,500.00) and was divided into 60,626,700 registered shares with restricted transferability
(December 31, 2013: 60,442,500), each with an arithmetical share of share capital of A 2.60 per share, and
is fully paid.

Each registered share grants one vote in the Annual General Meeting.

The increase in the number of shares in 2014 was due to the exercise of 9,210 options from STADA
warrants 2000/2015 in 2014. The number of shares as of December 31, 2014 thereby increased by 184,200
to 60,626,700 and the share capital of STADA Arzneimittel AG increased by A 478,920.00 to

(1) The previous year’s figures have been adjusted in accordance with the new IFRS 11 in connection with IAS 8 as well as in
connection with IAS 1 (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—3.).

**35. Equity and liabilities (Continued)**

A 157,629,420.00. As of December 31, 2014 88,176 warrants 2000/2015 for the subscription of 1,763,520
registered shares with restricted transferability continued to be outstanding.

As of December 31,2014, authorized share capital and conditional capital were comprised as follows:

**Registered**
**shares with**
**restricted**
**Amount in** E **transferability** **Purpose**

Authorized capital . . . . . . . . . . . . 77,134,304.00 29,667,040 Increase of share capital (until
June 4, 2018)
Conditional capital 2004/I . . . . . . . 4,585,152.00 1,763,520 Settlement of subscription rights
from share options (STADA
warrants 2000/2015)
Conditional capital 2013 . . . . . . . . 69,188,340.00 26,610,900 Settlement of options and/or
conversion rights (until June 4,
2018) in connection with issued
bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds, participation
rights and/or participating bonds in
the total nominal amount of up to
A 1.0 billion, or in the scope of a
guarantee assumed for bonds with
warrants and/or convertible bonds,
participation rights and/or
participating bonds issued by
subordinate Group companies

**35.2. Capital reserve**

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and include in particular the capital reserve of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Differences to the capital reserve
determined according to the provisions of German commercial law primarily result from the recognition at
their market value of the shares of STADA Arzneimittel AG newly issued in 2003 as well as the associated
treatment of issuing costs, which were deducted from the capital reserve.

**35.3. Retained earnings including net income**

Retained earnings including net income comprise net income for the financial year as well as earnings
generated in previous periods, provided these were not distributed, including amounts transferred to
retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized
directly in equity are reported under this item taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2014, a net expense in the
amount of A 15.5 million after deferred taxes—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling
interests—resulted from the remeasurement. It is mainly based on the substantial decrease in the discount
rate for various defined benefit plans in the STADA Group underlying the measurement of December 31,
2014 in comparison to December 31, 2013.

**35.4. Other provisions**

Other provisions include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are recognized in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve. The provisions available for sale and the provisions for cash flow
hedges include the results from the measurement at fair value of financial instruments categorized as
available for sale, and the measurement results from cash flow hedges from the effective portion of the
hedge, allowing for deferred taxes respectively.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**35. Equity and liabilities (Continued)**

The reduction of other provisions as compared to the previous year is primarily composed of opposing
effects. On the one hand, an increase in other provisions from the currency translation of financial
statements of companies reporting in pound sterling was recorded. This was primarily due to the
appreciation of the British pound sterling since December 31, 2013. On the other hand, there was a
significantly higher decrease in other provisions, which primarily resulted from the currency translation of
financial statements of companies reporting in the Russian ruble and Serbian dinar as a consequence of
the significant weakening of both the Russian ruble and Serbian dinar since December 31, 2013.

**35.5. Treasury shares**

As of the balance sheet date, the Company held 89,835 treasury shares (previous year: 91,989), each with
an arithmetical par value of A 2.60 per share, which is equivalent to 0.15% (previous year: 0.15%) of the
share capital. In financial year 2014, 2,154 treasury shares were sold at an average price of A 31.62 per
share within the scope of an employee stock option program.

**35.6. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares of non-controlling shareholders relate to minority interests of other shareholders in the subsidiaries
STADA Thailand, STADA Import/ Export International, STADA Vietnam, Pymepharco, STADA
Pharmaceuticals (Beijing), Well Light Investment Services, Hemomont and Hemofarm Banja Luka.

**36. Other non-current provisions**

Other non-current provisions made by STADA as of the balance sheet date in Germany and outside
Germany include pension provisions and other non-current provisions in the form of anniversary
provisions and provisions for working time accounts as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2014** **Dec. 31, 2013**


Germany . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,155 37,955

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of a reinsurance police, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among others, government bonds and securities funds.

In Germany, plan assets were increased by additional contributions in financial year 2014. This led to a
decrease in provisions.

In financial year 2014, the plan assets of an international subsidiary exceeded their pension obligations,
with a result that, as in the previous year, these assets in excess were reported under other assets as assets
from overfunded pension plans in the amount of A 0.1 million (previous year: A 0.7 million).

(1) The previous year’s figures have been adjusted in accordance with the new IFRS 11 in connection with IAS 8 as well as in
connection with IAS 1 (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—3.).

The negative past service cost (as income) is primarily attributable to plan changes in plan in Serbia, the
Netherlands and Russia. In Serbia, the definition of pensionable salary was changed, in the Netherlands,
the pension plan was adapted to the tax regulations applicable as of 2015 and in Russia, the effect mainly
resulted from a settlement of plans.

The change in the average salary and pension trends can be attributed to the outsourcing of the pension
commitment to a pension fund. For this pension commitment, a long-term discretionary participation in
the active phase as a salary trend and in the performance phase as a pension trend is assumed.

The lower average pension trend as compared to the previous year mainly resulted from the decrease in
the pension trends in the United Kingdom, Russia and the Netherlands.

A sensitivity analysis was carried out in which only one assumption was changed in each case and all other
assumptions were not changed. In the following, the change in the defined benefit obligation of the
pension obligations (DBO) for German Group companies is presented according to a change in the
discount rate, salary trends and pension trends.

The higher sensitivity of the salary trend can be attributed to the outsourcing of a pension commitment to
a pension fund. For this pension commitment, a long-term discretionary participation in the active phase as
a salary trend is assumed.

**36. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

As of December 31, 2014, the weighted duration of the pension obligations amounts to 23 years (previous
year: 20 years) for German Group companies and 19 years (previous year: 18 years) for international
Group companies.

In the coming financial years, the following payments from the Company and from plan assets overall are
expected for defined benefit plans:

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan, are expected in the amount of A 0.8 million for German companies and
A 1.7 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of the standard IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate
obligations for the company. For the STADA Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the
United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 87%. Accordingly,
the following details focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension
plans. Regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The pension plans are
predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan
participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension.

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2014, plan assets amounted to A 39.3 million and were composed of
three different plans. There are no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the—regarding its amount—material obligation including associated risks was outsourced in financial
year 2014. There is also the common risk, furthermore, of the interest rate development and the risk that
the real future salary development exceeds the salary development derived from assumptions taken in the
evaluation.

In the third quarter of 2014, the implementation method for the pension obligation for the Chairman of
the Executive Board was changed. It will be implemented through an independent pension fund in the
future. The pension commitment has been fundamentally changed in the context of outsourcing it to the
pension fund. Accordingly, there is now a commitment to the Chairman of the Executive Board, upon
reaching the contractually agreed start of pension payments, for a lifelong pension in the form of a lower
monthly guaranteed pension as compared to the previous commitment as well as a variable
non-guaranteed participation feature from which a corresponding benefit increase may result. The start of
pension payments can in principle—with the corresponding change in the amount of monthly pension
payments—take place variably within a defined time period, which exceeds the formerly assumed
retirement age. In addition, a lifelong survivor’s pension and a temporary orphan’s pension will be paid in
case of death. In the context of the changed plan and the resulting changes with regard to the benefits
awarded according to the former benefit plan there were earnings from past service cost in the amount of
A 17.6 million. In addition, an expense from administrative costs for the benefit plan in the amount of
A 0.7 million and an expense from the adjustment of plan assets in the amount of A 1.0 million were
incurred. The balance of the two items were earnings of A 15.9 million, which were recorded in general and
administrative expenses. Despite the transfer of the defined benefit plan of the Chairman of the Executive
Board to an pension fund, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the
benefit plan as defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**36. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

The plan assets created in the context of the transfer lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must
be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is
fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future.

Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to the extent that the
vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands is,
in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned requirement.
The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement or early death.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets
received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. In
particular, the assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price. In practice, the assets are
estimated according to the amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2014, plan assets
amounted to A 22.8 million.

The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest
rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of
investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the
contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should
change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future
contributions received.

Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees
have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the
evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the
insurance, the company could be required to pay an additional contribution payment.

From January 1, 2015, new limits for annual attribution rates approved for tax purposes have been in effect
in the Netherlands; a cap for the maximum pensionable salary was also introduced. In order to comply with
legal requirements, the pension plan has been adjusted accordingly. The effect of the resulting changes was
recognized as past service cost. Overall, there was income.

In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees defined benefit plans that are concluded for new
hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plan plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator. The pension plans are
monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for
fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensure sufficient assets to cover the
technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and
participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the
discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases which may require the payment of additional
contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to
expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

In financial year 2014, the investment strategy in the United Kingdom was changed to the extent that the
titles held in the investment category of equity securities, which are generally subject to a higher volatility
risk, as well as titles held in the investment category of real estate were sold and reinvested in low-risk
classes of investment. As of December 31, 2014, plan assets amounted to A 23.9 million. All assets have
quoted market prices on an active market.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan according to federal pension law
(Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option.

**36. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

The Swiss benefit plan includes three sub-plans. Retirement benefits had already been envisaged by two of
the sub-plans, one sub-plan only provided for a lump sum benefit. This sub-plan has been changed so that
as of now the contractually agreed benefits will be paid not only in the form of a lump sum, but an option
for payment in the form of a pension was introduced. The effect of the plan change was recognized as past
service cost.

The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in
the relevant functional areas, amounted to A 23.9 million in financial year 2014.

The increase in financial liabilities mainly resulted from securing promissory notes in financial year 2014 in
the total amount of A 270 million and a loan in the amount of approx. A 83 million as of the balance sheet
date for the financing of the purchase of the branded product portfolio Aqualor�. In opposition, financial
liabilities were repaid in the current financial year.

For the financial liabilities existing as of the balance sheet date, a repayment in accordance with the
maturity disclosed in the balance sheet was generally assumed. For current liabilities due to banks, an
extension of existing credit lines was partly assumed. The variable interest payments from the promissory
notes were determined based on the interest rate last fixed before December 31, 2014.

Internal measures to ensure the necessary liquidity for repayment of financial liabilities are detailed in the
notes on the management of liquidity risk (see Note 47.5.).

**38. Trade accounts payable**

Of the total amount of trade accounts payable, A 0.1 million (previous year: A 0.1 million) are due after one
year.

The increase of trade accounts payable was primarily based on balance sheet date effects and the resulting
derivable cash flows.

**39. Other financial liabilities (Continued)**

In the reporting year, the outstanding purchase price liabilities primarily resulted, as in the previous year,
from installments which were not yet due for the acquisition of branded products in Russia. Furthermore,
the outstanding contingent purchase price payment for the acquisition of the British company Internis is
included in financial year 2014.

Finance lease liabilities, such as for vehicles and passenger vehicles amount to A 3.1 million (previous year:
A 8.5 million). Liabilities for sale-and-leaseback transactions for software and software licenses recognized
in the previous year no longer exist as of the balance-sheet date December 31, 2014. Considering interest
in the amount of A 0.6 million (previous year: A 1.7 million), lease installments payable in subsequent years
total A 3.7 million (previous year: A 10.2 million). The lease liabilities are due as follows:

In addition, the negative market values of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss were
reported in liabilities from derivative financial instruments. In financial year 2014, this continued to relate,
as in the previous year, to interest rate swaps, which are used as hedging instruments and, in addition,
cross-currency swaps and currency forwards (see Note 47.7.). Within the scope of the maturity date
analysis, the following contractually agreed remaining terms result for these derivative financial liabilities:

Remaining financial liabilities include liabilities from discount agreements of German STADA companies
in the amount of A 192.1 million (previous year: A 214.7 million) and furthermore comprise many
insignificant individual items in the Group companies. The remaining financial liabilities fall due in the
amount of A 223.8 million (previous year: A 250.3 million) within one year, in the amount of A 0.5 million
after one year and up to five years (previous year: A 3.1 million).

**42. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure,
financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in
foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from
operating activities amounted to A 223.8 million in the reporting year (previous year[(1)]: A 203.7 million).
The increase by A 20.1 million as compared to the previous year mainly resulted from a substantial
cash-effective decrease in trade accounts receivable, whereas a substantial cash-effective increase was
recorded in the previous year, as well as from lower income tax payments. The resulting positive effects
were partially compensated by a substantial cash-effective decrease in trade accounts payable as compared
to a substantial cash-effective increase in trade accounts payable in the previous year. In addition, a
significantly higher cash-effective decrease in other non-current provisions was recorded in financial year
2014, which is connected to the transfer of a defined benefit plan to an external pension fund.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from
disposals. This amounted to A �262.0 million in the reporting year (previous year[(1)]: A �312.0 million).

In financial year 2014, payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A 181.4 million
(previous year: A 53.0 million) were made, of which A 147.5 million (previous year: A 13.5 million) related
to significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio.
Acquisition-related sales growth was generally associated with these investments in the reporting year.
Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets in the financial year amounted to A 12.0 million (previous
year[(1)]: A 5.4 million).

In financial year 2014, cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by high payments for
investments in intangible assets, which primarily related to the purchase of the Russian branded product
portfolio Aqualor�. Furthermore, there were payments for business combinations from the purchase of the
branded product portfolio Flexitol� and the acquisition of the British company Internis. Proceeds from the
disposal of intangible assets mainly resulted from the sale of approvals and trademarks in France and Italy.
Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment primarily related to the sale of a building in
the United Kingdom. In the previous year, payments for investments in business combinations primarily
resulted from the purchase price payments made for the acquisition of the British OTC supplier
Thornton & Ross as well as from the final purchase price payments for the additional shares and the
control achieved over the Vietnamese pharmaceutical company Pymepharco and for the pharmaceutical
wholesaling and commercial business acquired from Spirig Pharma, in each case following the deduction of
acquired cash and cash equivalents.

Cash flow from financing activities amounted to A 83.7 million in financial year 2014 (previous year[(1)]:
A 148.8 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution
payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. In the reporting
year, there were proceeds from securing financial liabilities, among other things, in connection with
promissory notes secured in financial year 2014 in the total amount of A 270 million and a loan in the

amount of approx. A 121 million for financing the purchase of the branded product portfolio Aqualor�. In
the previous year, higher proceeds from taking up financial liabilities were recorded, in particular due to
the bond placed in the second quarter of 2013. Furthermore, more financial liabilities were repaid in the
previous year than in the reporting period.

Dividend distribution payments of A 39.8 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders
of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2013. A significant increase was thus achieved in the
distributed volume as compared to the dividend for financial year 2012.

Proceeds from the capital increase are the result of the exercise of STADA warrants 2000/2015
(see Note 35.1.).

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities
amounted to A �38.2 million in financial year 2014 (previous year[(1)]: A �108.2 million) and is therefore
still significantly characterized by a high volume of acquisitions.

Free cash flow, adjusted for effects from payments for significant investments and acquisitions and effects
of proceeds from significant disposals is calculated as follows:

**43. Segment information**

The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting
methods used in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Services between the segments are charged
based on market prices.

Segmentation within the STADA Group is based on sales differentiation. Thus, the allocation to the
individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for
parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reallocated.

Generally, STADA’s operating segments are divided into the two core segments, Generics and Branded
Products, as well as into the non-core segment Commercial Business.

Pursuant to STADA’s segment definition, which has been used since 2006, Generics are products for the
health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or several active ingredients whose
commercial property rights have expired or will expire shortly and whose sales positioning complies with
one of the two following criteria:

- The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another
supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient, or

- the product is an integral part of a marketing concept targeting more than one product and indication
for primarily prescription products with active ingredients whose commercial property rights have
usually expired.

(1) The previous year’s figures have been adjusted in accordance with the new IFRS 11 in connection with IAS 8 as well as in
connection with IAS 1 (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—3.).

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**43. Segment information (Continued)**

According to STADA’s segment definition, which has been used since 2006, Branded Products are products
for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients whose commercial property
rights have usually expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two following criteria:

- The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products, or

- the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly
sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products.

STADA also conducts business and has equity interests in fields outside the core segments. As a rule, the
objective of these activities is to supplement and support the Group’s activities in the core segments.
Transactions that mainly involve trading and selling—such as in wholesaling activities—are grouped
together in the Commercial Business segment. All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be
directly allocated to the segments, as well as the elimination of sales between segments are recognized
under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and consolidation.

Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not,
however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In
addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance
organization billings are included here. Reporting of the segment liabilities and non-current segment assets
is waived, as this is without relevance for Group monitoring and for Group reporting.

In the presentation of sales by the company’s registered office, sales to third parties are shown according to
the invoicing company’s registered office of the countries listed.

Disclosures on assets by country relate to parts of the non-current assets (intangible assets, property, plant
and equipment).

**43.5. Information about major customers**

In accordance with IFRS 8.34, a company must provide notification when sales revenues from business
activities from a single external customer amount to at least 10% of the company’s total sales revenues. As
in the previous year, this related to no customer in the reporting year.

**44. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations with respect to third parties which result from past
events and which may lead to a future outflow of resources depending on specific events. As of the balance
sheet date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are therefore not recognized.

(1) The previous year’s figures have been adjusted in accordance with the new IFRS 11 in connection with IAS 8 as well as in
connection with IAS 1 (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—3.).

**44. Contingent liabilities (Continued)**

STADA has contingent liabilities, among other things, in connection with patent risks for certain active
pharmaceutical ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The resulting possible
obligations amounted to approx. A 18.9 million (previous year: A 11.1 million), from which, in addition to
the contingent liabilities for patent risks reported in the Annual Report 2013, further contingent liabilities
in the amount of A 5.6 million in the market region Central Europe and in the amount of A 2.8 million in
the market region CIS/Eastern Europe resulted. Former contingent liabilities for patent risks in the
amount of A 0.6 million in the market region Central Europe no longer exist however, as a settlement was
reached for this issue due to a lost patent dispute and any additional potential obligations were satisfied by
a settlement payment. Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow
of assets is under 50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2014, the insolvency administrator of Velefarm Holding and Velefarm
VFB submitted a lawsuit to Belgrade’s commercial court against Hemofarm A.D., a subsidiary of STADA
Arzneimittel AG, and Velefarm Prolek, a company of the Vele-farm group.[(1)] The statement of claim
names potential repayments to the insolvent assets, which could result from this claim, with amounts
quantified at approx. A 54.2 million (in local currency translated using the currency exchange rate at that
time). However, it has to be taken into consideration that Hemofarm as creditor of the insolvent assets
would retrieve a quota of the insolvent assets in a significant amount. Hemofarm and STADA continue to
believe that the lawsuit is unfounded. For this reason no provisions were made for this purpose.

**45. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there were other future financial obligations, which can be broken
down as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2014** **Dec. 31, 2013**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 72,892 70,973

Liabilities from operating leases relate particularly to IT equipment and vehicles. In addition, there are
liabilities from long-term rental agreements for office buildings with an average contract term of 4 years.

The total of future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to A 72.9 million as of the
end of the financial year (previous year: A 71.0 million) and can be broken down according to remaining
term as follows:

**Operating lease**

Lease payments in the amount of A 29.2 million (previous year[(2)]: A 29.5 million) were recognized as an
expense in financial year 2014.

**45. Other financial obligations (Continued)**

As of December 31, 2013, other financial obligations consisted of an obligation of Nizhpharm amounting
to A 131.0 million toward Butterwood Holdings Limited, Cyprus, for the purchase of the Russian branded
product portfolio Aqualor�[(3)], whereby the completion of the contract was still subject to comprehensive
completion conditions as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, this other financial obligation
no longer exists, as the residual amount of the purchase price liability still outstanding as of December 31,
2014 of A 13.1 million has been recorded in the balance sheet under other financial liabilities.

Furthermore there is still a guarantee amounting to A 25.0 million towards Hospira Inc., Lake Forest,
Illinois, USA, in connection with a supply agreement between Hospira and the shares in the associated
company BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG which are recognized under the equity method.

STADA, as guarantor, has recognized these guarantees in the reporting year as financial guarantees in
accordance with IAS 39 at their fair value in the amount of A 0.3 million (previous year: A 0.3 million).
Utilization of these guarantees granted is currently not expected.

Furthermore, the remaining financial liabilities included, among other things, additional guarantees
assumed by the STADA Group.

**46. Disclosures about financial instruments (Continued)**

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short remaining terms,
their carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to the fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the following chart in the case of
promissory notes, bonds, as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the current
yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the fair values.

Available-for-sale financial assets are, in addition to a smaller portion of shares measured at fair value,
primarily the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated investments which are entirely
measured at amortized cost for lack of available market prices.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables as well as of held-to-maturity financial investments with
remaining terms of more than a year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respectively current interest parameters that reflect market and
partner-related changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade accounts payable as well as remaining
financial liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the
fair values.

For the disclosures according to class of financial instrument necessary in accordance with IFRS 7, STADA
defines each valuation category as a class.

The chart below shows how the valuation rates of financial instruments measured at fair value were
determined for the respective classes of financial instruments:

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, STADA reviews the allocation to the
respective hierarchy levels according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If the
need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the
reporting period. In the reporting year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy
levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market analyses and change analyses are carried out.

Available-for-sale financial assets (AfS) relate to shares for which market prices are available for
measurement. Derivative financial assets (FAHfT) and derivative financial liabilities (FLHfT) include
positive or negative market values of derivative financial instruments (interest rate/currency swaps and
foreign exchange swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values were determined using
appropriate valuation models by external third parties. This includes the application of discounted cash
flow methods, which are largely based on input parameters observable in the market. The cash flows which
are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve are discounted to the measurement date

**46. Disclosures about financial instruments (Continued)**

with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the balance sheet date. The same
applies for the calculation of the fair values of the derivative financial liabilities with a hedging
relationship, which reflect the negative market values of the interest rate swaps used as hedging
instruments.

The subsequent chart shows how the valuation rates of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis were determined:

The assets held for sale comprise real estate held by a STADA subsidiary in Serbia. The non-recurring
basis for the determination of fair value is based on an appraisal prepared by an independent expert and
was largely determined based on input parameters observable in the market.

As STADA utilizes pricing information from external third parties without further correction in the
determination of the fair value, and therefore does not produce any quantitative, non-observable input
factors, the option of IFRS 13 to waive the disclosure of quantitative information on such input factors is
taken.

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result, dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from interest rate/currency swaps recognized at fair value with an effect on income, which
are reported under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the currency translation
result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other income or other expenses.
Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to currency swaps expired in financial year 2014.

Valuation results from financial assets held for sale and cash flow hedges, which are reported under other
comprehensive income in equity, are not included in this presentation as they had no effect on income.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**47. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**

**47.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Executive Board in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all
transactions above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Executive Board must first be approved
by the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount
of current risks. With a view to assets, liabilities and planned transactions, these risks relate in particular to
changes in exchange rates and interest rates. It is the objective of financial risk management to limit these
market risks of ongoing operative and finance-related activities. For this purpose, depending on the
assessment of the financial risk, selected derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments are used.

However, on principle only financial risks are hedged which have significant consequences on the Group’s
cash flow.

**47.2. Currency risks**

STADA’s Group and balance sheet currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, STADA is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

STADA counters risks from currency related cash flow fluctuations with derivative financial instruments,
which are exclusively used to hedge currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions
and investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

In addition to natural hedges, STADA generally employs different financial derivatives to hedge assets,
liabilities and anticipated future cash flows denominated in foreign currency. In the reporting year 2014,
STADA made particular use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The
maturity dates of futures contracts are thereby selected to match the Company’s anticipated cash flows.
These contracts are currently valid for up to three years.

In the context of consolidated financial statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to
an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of
earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro
(translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally negative
and depreciation is generally positive. Currency risks primarily stem from business transactions in the
following currencies: Russian ruble, pound sterling and Serbian dinar. This risk is not hedged.

It cannot be ruled out, however, that hedging strategies against currency risks turn out to be insufficient,
wrong or suboptimal.

STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In case of hedging transactions they are compared with the positive
or negative balances from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign

Here, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items in the Russian ruble and Serbian dinar relate to a balance from
foreign currency reserves at international Group companies in euro and outstanding foreign currency
reserves in the Russian ruble and Serbian dinar. The reported outstanding foreign currency items in
Kazakhstani tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia exclusively relate to foreign currency reserves at international
Group companies in euro. The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro,
from the Group’s perspective, results from the functional currency of the respective international Group
company. Overall, based on outstanding foreign currency items as of the balance sheet date, an
appreciation or a devaluation of the euro by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group
would have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A 7.1 million (previous year:
A 7.6 million) or in the amount of earnings of A 7.1 million (previous year: A 7.6 million).

**47.3. Interest rate risks**

STADA is subject to interest risks from financial assets as well as financial debts, primarily in the Euro
zone and Russia.

In order to minimize the effects of significant interest rate fluctuations, STADA manages the interest rate
risk, to the extent possible, for the financial liabilities denominated in euro with hedging transactions. In
financial year 2014, to hedge the interest rate risk, there were cash flow hedges in the form of interest-rate
swaps. Taking into account these hedging transactions, an average of 85% (previous year: 72%) of financial
liabilities denominated in euro and 41% (previous year: 100%) of those denominated in ruble had fixed
interest rates in 2014.

STADA calculates existing interest rate risks using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors are generally included in the calculation:

- changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments in
the context of cash flow hedges,

- changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are
not hedged against interest rate risks, and

- changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

**47.4. Default risks**

In addition, STADA may be exposed to a default risk in its operating business or as a result of financing
activities if contracting parties fail to meet their obligations.

To avoid default risks in financing activities respective credit management processes are in place and such
transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing.

Risks of default exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. In addition, there is the risk that in a
difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments
to STADA or business partners of STADA and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks
arise.

STADA therefore strives to maintain business relations only with business partners of impeccable financial
standing and in addition, partly uses suitable measures to safeguard itself against default risk, such as
guarantees, letters of credit, credit insurance or the transfer of assets. However, it cannot be ruled out that
these measures are insufficient and non-payments of individual debtors, and therefore burdens from
one-time special effects, arise to a significant extent. Past due receivables in the operating area are
continuously monitored and potential default risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation
adjustments.

The supply of goods and services to international wholesalers is subject to special monitoring.
Concentrations of risk are assumed if debtors exceed a particular credit volume, for which no securities
were transferred. As of the balance sheet date however, there are no significant concentrations of risks at
STADA exceeding the value adjustments for receivables with respect to local wholesalers in CEE countries
classified as a special effect in previous years.

STADA’s maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amounts of the financial assets
recognized. In addition, STADA granted guarantees, which amounted to a total nominal volume of
A 25.3 million (previous year: A 156.4 million) as of the balance sheet date (see Note 45.). STADA has
various forms of collateral for credit securities such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees,
assignments of receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for
certain markets and customers.

**47.5. Liquidity risks**

The Group’s liquidity was guaranteed at all times in financial year 2014. In the context of continuous
liquidity planning, the cash flows of all companies are regularly monitored. In order to secure the financial
flexibility and financial security of STADA, a liquidity reserve in the form of cash is held and supplemented
by free credit lines. For this purpose, STADA regularly concludes bilateral credit contracts for a period of
at least 12 months with various banks. The refinancing of the financial liabilities is consequently monitored
in the context of continuous liquidity planning.

**(Continued)**

**47.6. Other price risks**

In the context of a hypothetical risk assessment, there are also other price change risks related to market
prices. However, as of the balance sheet date, STADA only recognizes available-for-sale financial assets,
whose fair values are determined based on market prices, to a minor extent.

**47.7. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

STADA counters risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are
exclusively used to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial
transactions and investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation
purposes.

In financial year 2014, there are cash flow hedges exclusively in the form of payer interest rate swaps. Here,
variable interest payments are transformed into fixed interest payments and the cash flow risk of variable
interest liabilities is thus hedged. In the context of these hedging relationships, interest rate related cash
flow changes of the hedged items are netted with cash flow changes of interest rate swaps.

In financial year 2014, no new payer interest-rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in order to
secure interest payments from promissory notes.

Foreign currency derivatives are generally held to hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities. As of the
balance sheet date, there are three currency swaps, which serve to hedge foreign currency loans, but which
were not designated as fair value hedge.

**Term** **Swap from** **Swap to**

The income from the measurement of these hedging transactions in the total amount of A 0.7 million was
netted under currency translation result, recognized under other expenses.

As of the balance sheet date, furthermore, there are four interest rate/currency swaps in the form of crosscurrency swaps, which serve to hedge foreign currency loans, but which were not designated as fair value
hedge.

The earnings from the measurement of these hedging transactions were netted under currency translation
result in other expenses in the total amount of A 18.4 million (previous year: A 8.0 million) and in the
amount of A 3.6 million (previous year: A 1.6 million) under other financial income. The currency
translation effects of the individual hedged items as well as the cross-currency swaps balance out in the
currency translation result.

The terms of the cash flow hedges existing as of the balance sheet date end between 2015 and 2016.

All hedges are assumed to be highly effective as the important features are nearly identical (critical terms
match). As of the balance-sheet date, all of the hedging relationships presented above were effective. All
changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments were therefore recognized directly in equity
under ‘‘Provisions for cash flow hedges’’. In financial year 2014, the resulting earnings amounted to
A 1.5 million after consideration of deferred taxes (previous year: A 2.3 million).

**47.8. Disclosures on capital management**

The objectives of the STADA capital management are the safeguarding of the business operation, the
creation of a solid equity base for financing profitable growth and guaranteeing attractive dividend
payments and the capital service. The STADA capital management consistently aims for the Group
companies to have an equity basis that corresponds to the local requirements. When implementing and
checking the Group’s capital and liquidity the legal requirements are taken into account.

Capital is monitored on the basis of net debt, which results from current and non-current financial
liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents as well as available-for-sale securities. As an important key
figure for capital management at STADA, the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which improved to 3.1
in the reporting year as compared to the previous year (previous year [(1)]: 3.2).

In this connection, the net debt and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio were as follows:

**in E 000s** **Dec. 31, 2014** **Dec. 31, 2013[(1)]**

**48. Related party transactions (Continued)**

In addition, the following disclosures on related party transactions are made:

STADA continues to provide the associated company BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG with a credit
line facility with an interest rate that is partly usual for risk capital and of which a total of A 3.3 million
(previous year: A 15.6 million) had been used as of December 31, 2014.

There is a service contract with BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as well as semi-exclusive distribution
rights for Epo-zeta in Germany granted by BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG to, among others, cell

already received at the same time a semi-exclusive local sales license as well. BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG has so far not made use of any own personnel—except for the company’s boards
according to stock corporation law—but has exclusively assigned companies from the STADA Group with
this, which invoice at normal market conditions.

**AUDITOR’S REPORT**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by STADA Arzneimittel
Aktiengesellschaft, Bad Vilbel, comprising the balance sheet, the income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, the cash flow statement and the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, together with the group management report for the business year from
January 1 to December 31, 2014. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315a Abs. (paragraph) 1 HGB (‘‘Handels-gesetzbuch’’: German
Commercial Code) are the responsibility of the legal representatives of the company. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and on the group management report
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and
German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of net assets, financial
position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with
reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit
procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting related internal control system and the evidence
supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are
examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit.

The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the
determination of the entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements and the group management report.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the consolidated financial statements comply with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
§ 315a Abs. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the
Group’s position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.
