Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘ongoing,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’ ‘‘project,’’ ‘‘seek,’’ ‘‘target’’ or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in ‘‘Risk _Factors.’’ In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements_ contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - our highly competitive industry; - extensive governmental regulation and changes in these regulations, or our failure to comply with regulations; - changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory factors which are beyond our control; - existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities or government-sponsored healthcare systems; - failure to obtain necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products; - failure to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new Generics products in a timely manner; - the risk of litigation and other claims, including with respect to the infringement of third parties proprietary rights and disputes with other STADA shareholders; - the risk of industrial action or adverse labor relations; - reputational issues due to product liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived; - acceptance of the products by end-users and independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists; - problems in manufacturing products; - potential significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt-on acquisitions; - disruption of our operations due to accidents, equipment malfunctioning or other unexpected events; - accidental contamination, non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or environmental, health and safety litigation or liability; - our failure to renew agreements with material suppliers and wholesale customers on acceptable terms or the termination of such agreements; - changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems leading to delivery bottlenecks or unintentional increase in inventories; - significant increases in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our products or lack of their availability; - risks associated with cross-border sales and purchases; - risks related to conducting operations in several different countries; viii ----- - pricing adjustments of cross-border transactions leading to greater or double taxation of profits; - risks of national and international sanctions affecting Russia, in which we operate manufacturing facilities and sales entities and have significant sales; - international sanctions, including economic and trade sanctions imposed by the European Union and other jurisdictions, affecting our international sales and operations, including in Russia; - the result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union; - the potential decline of our sales and profits from generic pharmaceutical products as a result of competition, both from other pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental pricing pressure; - undesirable side effects or other properties of our products that delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential; - counterfeit versions of our products; - the termination of licenses from third-party pharmaceutical companies; - our inability to retain key personnel; - a breakdown in our information technology systems; - our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal data; - default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of contracting parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations; - risks related to potential negative long-term health effects of vaping products use; - fluctuations in exchange rates; - transfer price risks; - impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; - operating risks, including natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, terrorism and other criminal activities; - any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto; - changes to the composition of the Eurozone; - defaults under certain other indebtedness of STADA as a result of the grant of security in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; - our inability to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings; and - other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ These risks and others described under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

Any forward-looking statements contained in such industry and market data were made prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and have not been updated to account for the impact of such outbreak. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have been materially different if the Covid-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements.’’ We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry. In certain cases, it is difficult in this sector to obtain precise market, economic and industry information. Certain information used in this offering memorandum has been obtained from IQVIA Holdings, Inc. (formerly, Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.) (‘‘IQVIA’’), a leading information, services and technology company. In particular, information obtained from IQVIA includes descriptions of the pharmaceutical markets in certain geographies and details of the Group’s market share and competitive position, which may be based on manufacturer or pharmacy sales and volume or value. In addition, certain information regarding industry benchmarks and potential cost savings have been obtained by the Sponsors (as defined herein) from a leading global consulting firm. None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers accepts responsibility for the factual correctness of any such statistics or information obtained from third parties. While the Senior Secured Notes Issuer believes this information to be reliable, it has not been independently verified, and we do not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. Additionally, industry publications and reports from management consultants generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.1,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial Information,4.1.1,,"This offering memorandum includes the historical financial statements listed below (together, our ‘‘Financial Statements’’): - the audited consolidated financial statements of German Topco as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, which are presented in accordance with IFRS and the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315(e)(1) of the HGB, including the auditor’s report thereon (the ‘‘Topco Financial Statements’’); and - the audited consolidated financial statements of STADA as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, which are presented in accordance with IFRS and the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315(e)(1) of the HGB, including the auditor’s report thereon (the ‘‘STADA Financial Statements’’). German Topco has consolidated STADA and its subsidiaries since August 22, 2017, when it indirectly acquired control over STADA pursuant to the Takeover Offer and, as a result, the financial information of German Topco for 2017 covers only the stub period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Prior to completion of the STADA Acquisition, none of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Topco had any material assets or liabilities (other than nominal share capital) or conducted any operations. As a result, in order to compare twelve months of operations for all the periods presented in this offering memorandum, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we have included in this offering memorandum the consolidated financial statements of STADA and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we have included in this offering memorandum the consolidated financial Statements of German Topco. We have included in this offering memorandum the consolidated financial statements of German Topco instead of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, because we report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations on an ongoing basis at the level of German Topco. The notes to German Topco’s consolidated financial statements include reconciliation columns to the consolidated financial statements of each of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In the ‘‘Summary Consolidated _Financial and Other Information,’’ ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial Information’’ and_ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ sections of this offering memorandum, we have presented the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe that this presentation is more useful to investors than presenting the financial information of German Topco because such presentation excludes additional interest expense and liabilities outside the perimeter of the restricted group of the Senior Notes Issuer. In this offering memorandum, we present the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer, as opposed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, because the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer reflects the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Notes, which we believe provides a more meaningful illustration of the Group’s capital structure. The comparability of the STADA Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements (including the reconciliation to the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s consolidated financial information contained therein) may be limited. For example, certain consultancy costs related to the STADA Acquisition were incurred by German Topco and the Issuers. Furthermore, only a portion of the debt incurred by the Issuers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement in connection with the STADA Acquisition was on-lent to STADA to refinance its STADA Existing Debt. In addition, German Topco incurred substantial liabilities under deeply-subordinated shareholder funding instruments the proceeds of which were ultimately passed on as equity funding to the Senior Notes Issuer as the Sponsors’ equity contribution in connection with the STADA Acquisition. As a result, there may be material differences in the amount of liabilities, financial results, income taxes and earnings reflected in the STADA Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements. German Topco and the Issuers accounted for the STADA Acquisition, and will account for the recent acquisitions of the Takeda CIS Assets and Walmark, using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS. Under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), the consideration transferred in an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred by the acquirer on the date of the acquisition, any liabilities incurred by the acquirer to the former owners of the target and any equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for deferred costs related to the acquisition of xvi ----- debt or equity securities. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests in the target over the identifiable net assets on the acquisition date is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with IFRS, we had a measurement period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation for the STADA Acquisition. While we allocated the purchase price of the STADA Acquisition on a preliminary basis in the audited consolidated financial statements of German Topco for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the other financial information of German Topco included in this offering memorandum reflects the final purchase price allocation. As a result, the audited consolidated financial statements of German Topco for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017, are not directly comparable with the other financial information of German Topco included in this offering memorandum and German Topco’s financial statements for future periods. The application of the purchase price allocation of the STADA Acquisition resulted in different carrying values for certain assets and certain liabilities and therefore further affects the comparability of the Topco Financial Statements and the STADA Financial Statements. The STADA Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, statement of financial position or statement of cash flows that might have occurred as a result of purchase price allocation adjustments to be applied due to the STADA Acquisition and ancillary transactions. In the section of this offering memorandum entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations’’ we have discussed the results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer (as derived from the_ Topco Financial Statements) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and STADA (as derived from the STADA Financial Statements) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. We believe this discussion is more meaningful than comparing the results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer to those of STADA. The financial information of STADA as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, which has been included in this offering memorandum, has been taken or derived from the STADA Financial Statements or from accounting records or internal management reporting systems of STADA. The financial information of German Topco as of and for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, which has been included in this offering memorandum, has been taken or derived from the Topco Financial Statements or from accounting records or internal management reporting systems of German Topco. With effect as of January 1, 2018, we have adopted new standards for revenue recognition in accordance with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and the recognition of financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments). See note 3 to the STADA Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this offering memorandum. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, we recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘‘operating leases’’ under the principles of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases.’’ We recognized a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing our obligation to make lease payments. We elected to apply the modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16, and as such the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, January 1, 2019. The adoption of IFRS 16 had an impact on our balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. In implementing IFRS 16, the Topco Financial Statements have been prepared under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was recognized at the date of initial application, January 1, 2019. As a result, the comparability of our income statement information between these periods is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets and a decrease of rent expense on operating leases. In addition, the comparability of our balance sheet information between these dates is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, resulted in an increase in current and non-current other financial liabilities. To facilitate a comparison of our results of operations and financial condition across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease accounting standard, we present additional information under ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other _Information.’’ See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting_ xvii ----- _Standards—IFRS 16’’ and the Topco Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this_ offering memorandum. As of the date of this offering memorandum, each of German Topco, German Midco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding, management and finance company with no business operations of its own. The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material assets consist of its indirect interest in STADA’s share capital and intercompany loans to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material liabilities consist of the obligations under the Senior Notes and deeply-subordinated shareholder loans. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s only material assets consists of its indirect interests in STADA’s share capital and intercompany loans to German Holdco (if any). The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s only material liabilities consist of the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. German Topco’s only material assets consist of its indirect interest in STADA’s share capital and intercompany loans to its direct subsidiary, German Midco. German Topco’s only material liabilities consist of the obligations under shareholder loans owed to its immediate parent company, Nidda MidCo S.`a r.l. This offering memorandum includes certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, presented at the level of the Senior Notes Issuer, on an adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom and certain other transactions as described in ‘‘Capitalization,’’ including financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the Offering and such transactions on the Issuers’ indebtedness as if the Offering and such transactions had occurred on December 31, 2019, and on the Senior Notes Issuer’s interest expense as if the Offering and such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The pro forma financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Issuers’ indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Offering and certain other transactions as described in ‘‘Capitalization’’ occurred on December 31, 2019, or January 1, 2019, respectively; nor does it purport to project the Issuers’ financial results, indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The pro forma financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards or in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. When calculating sales by country as presented in this offering memorandum, we allocate sales to the country in which the invoice recipient is located. We present certain financial information in this offering memorandum for our two operational divisions, our Generics division and our Branded Products division. The Topco Financial Statements do not present the financial data of these divisions. We present divisional financial information in this offering memorandum as we believe it provides useful information to investors about our business.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.2,Non-GAAP Financial Measures,4.2.1,General,"In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary Non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum include Adjusted Capital Expenditures, Adjusted Cash Conversion, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit, adjusted sales, capital expenditures, constantcurrency sales, Earnings Before Taxes, EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBITDA (before leases), Gross Profit, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA margin, Management Normalized EBITDA, Net Working Capital, operating profit and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (our ‘‘Non-GAAP Measures’’). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this offering memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated Net Income’’ and ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ presented in the Indentures. xviii ----- Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows: - ‘‘Adjusted Capital Expenditures’’ is defined as capital expenditures (as defined below), excluding payments for significant investments and acquisitions; - ‘‘Adjusted Cash Conversion’’ is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Management Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below); - ‘‘Adjusted Free Cash Flow’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), less Adjusted Capital Expenditures (as defined above). The definition of ‘‘Adjusted Free Cash Flow’’ used in the Financial Statements for regular reporting purposes differs from the definition of Adjusted Free Cash Flow used in this offering memorandum; - ‘‘adjusted net income’’ is defined as net income, adjusted for special items; - ‘‘adjusted operating profit’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, investment income and result from investments measured at equity, adjusted for certain special items; - ‘‘adjusted sales’’ is defined as sales, adjusted for currency effects and portfolio changes; - ‘‘capital expenditures’’ is defined as total capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and financial assets as well as business combinations according to IFRS 3; - ‘‘constant-currency sales’’ is defined as sales, adjusted so that all of our non-euro denominated sales are translated into euro at the same constant exchange rate in all periods presented; - ‘‘Earnings Before Taxes’’ is defined as net income before income taxes; - ‘‘EBIT’’ is defined as net income before interest and taxes; - ‘‘EBITDA’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses; - ‘‘EBITDA margin’’ is defined as EBITDA divided by sales; - ‘‘EBITDA (before leases)’’ is defined as earnings before interest (including interest expense on lease liabilities), taxes, depreciation (including depreciation of lease assets in connection with leases), amortization, impairment losses and rent expense; - ‘‘Gross Profit’’ is defined as sales less cost of sales; - ‘‘Management Adjusted EBITDA’’ is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items. Management Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum is titled ‘‘EBITDA, adjusted’’ in the STADA Financial Statements; - ‘‘Management Adjusted EBITDA margin’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. Management Adjusted EBITDA margin as presented in this offering memorandum is titled ‘‘adjusted EBITDA margin’’ in the STADA Financial Statements; - ‘‘Management Normalized EBITDA’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain normalization adjustments; - ‘‘Net Working Capital’’ is defined as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables; - ‘‘operating profit’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, investment income and result from investments measured at equity; and - ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain Sponsor-identified adjustments and expected cost savings. These adjustments and cost savings have been determined solely by the Senior Notes Issuer as further described in the offering memorandum and should not be attributed to STADA. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA (before leases), Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. By eliminating certain effects that affect the comparability between periods, we believe adjusted sales, constant-currency sales, operating profit and adjusted operating profit enhance investors’ xix ----- understanding of our underlying operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. We believe a presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, net working capital, capital expenditures and Adjusted Capital Expenditures is useful to investors to assess our liquidity. For these reasons, we believe that our Non-GAAP Measures and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Each of our Non-GAAP Measures is defined and reconciled to its closest comparable IFRS measure under ‘‘Summary Consolidated Financial and Other _Information.’’ Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of_ other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of Non-GAAP Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.2,Non-GAAP Financial Measures,4.2.2,Constant-currency Sales,"We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of operations attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under IFRS, but also on a constant-currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure titled constant-currency sales. Constant-currency sales removes the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this measure facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of our operations. Our constant-currency sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, are computed by translating the actual values of our non-euro denominated sales as per our subsidiaries’ financial statements using the following adjusted foreign exchange rates instead of the actual foreign xx ----- exchange rates used for reporting purposes during the applicable period (except with respect to consolidation adjustments):",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability between periods. In calculating this adjustment in each period, we use the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative prior period to translate our non-euro denominated sales in euro. The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and divestments of companies and significant products. In calculating this adjustment in each period, we only take into account the organic sales generated by products that were sold in both periods that are being compared. In the section entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Results of Operations,’’ we provide a tabular reconciliation for each period between adjusted_ sales and reported sales, its closest comparable IFRS measure. Each such reconciliation table also shows the comparative data for the previous period.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on branded and unbranded generics, with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 30,000 SKUs covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA region, Asia, South America and Australia. We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales and we ranked ninth among OTC companies in Europe as of December 31, 2019. Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective manufacturing footprint comprising 21 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building on our tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each year since 2014. Our solid pipeline of new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated sales of A2,608.6 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of A885.3 million. The products we sell are classified according to two divisions: Generics and Branded Products. Generics:_ Within our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations of originator drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics division is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 18% of sales in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling products (and their respective therapeutic areas) in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Epoetin zeta (anemia), Tilidine, Tilidine/Naloxone (pain), Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Omeprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Pantoprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Diclofenac (pain, anti-inflammatory), Paracetamol (pain), Bisoprolol (high blood-pressure), Amoxi-Clavulan (antibiotic), Fentanyl (analgesic). The largest countries by sales in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia, Russia, France and Switzerland. We generated sales of A1,534.7 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A439.3 million in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019. Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products division primarily includes branded OTC products, which are typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests, cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-go (Parkinson’s disease). The market for products in our Branded Products division is generally characterized by market-driven pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty being important factors for success. Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 37% of sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling brands (and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Bortezomib (anti-cancer 1 ----- medication, prescription required multiple myeloma), APO-go (Parkinson’s disease, prescription required, available in 28 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in 28 countries), Zoflora (household disinfection), Snup (rhinitis), Aqualor (rhinitis, sore throats, available in 18 countries), Nizoral (anti-dandruff shampoo), Hirudoid (anti-coagulant), Vitaprost (prostate diseases) and Versatis (local anesthetic). The largest countries by sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Italy. We generated sales of A1,073.9 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A298.0 million in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Organic Growth Underpinned by Attractive Market Fundamentals and Bolt-on Acquisitions,"Increasing demand for our Generics and Branded Products is driven by global growth factors in the pharmaceutical industry, including population growth, aging societies, increased incidences of chronic disease, advances in medical therapies and increasing self-medication and health awareness. According to IQVIA, the global generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2020 to 2024, driven by these growth trends and increasing generics penetration. Generics penetration in the market for prescription products is partly driven by cost containment regulation that incentivizes the use of generics to counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs. Another key driver of generics penetration is patent expirations. According to publicly available estimates, a wave of patent expirations in developed markets is expected to push originator products with sales of more than $12.2 billion in aggregate into the generics market between 2019 and the end of 2022. Given that our Branded Products division consists mostly of OTC products, growth in this division is additionally driven by factors influencing the self-payment and self-care market for health and well-being related products. We expect demand for self-payment and self-care products to benefit from the ongoing trend among regulators to transfer prescription drugs to OTC status, which decreases the cost burden on the public health system and expands market opportunity for companies such as us that offer branded OTC products. Additionally, demand for OTC products is expected to be driven by rising income levels and the emerging trend toward greater health awareness, which we believe results from ongoing research on disease prevention, data access and increasing levels of education. According to IQVIA, the global OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2020 to 2024. In addition to our organic growth, we have a strong record of growth through focused acquisitions. In 2019, we acquired from GlaxoSmithKline five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, as well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and expanded our footprint in Eastern Europe and Asia through our acquisitions of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals in the Philippines (the ‘‘Fern C Acquisition’’), to bolster our presence in Asia following the disposal of our Vietnamese joint venture. Furthermore, we agreed to acquire the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG (the ‘‘Opti Pharm Acquisition’’), a specialist in the trade and distribution of pharmaceutical products in Switzerland, to expand our Swiss operations. Most recently, we acquired multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the Takeda Acquisition and a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe through the Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,Well-Established Generics Player with Leading Positions in Our Generics Division and an Attractive Portfolio in Our Branded Products Division with High Growth Potential Through Enhanced Internationalization,"We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales in Europe as of December 31, 2019. In our Generics division, based on IQVIA data for the year ended December 31, 2019, we held a top-three market share in generics sales in Germany. We were also the fourth-largest player in Italy and the fourth-largest in Spain. Moreover, in the year ended December 31, 2019, our Belgian Generics unit was the leader in the Belgian market, and we ranked second among national manufacturers in the Russian Generics market. Even though these markets are generally considered to be mature, there is significant room for increased penetration (by value) and further growth in generics in these markets. For example, according to IQVIA, generics penetration by sales value is below 30% in Belgium, 35% in Italy, 35% in Spain, and below 50% in France and 45% in Germany. The generics industry in Germany, Spain and Russia is expected to increase by a CAGR of 5.4%, 7.9% and 9.2% from 2020 to 2024, respectively. Continued growth in the generics 2 ----- industry in countries where we are already market leaders provides us with an opportunity to continue to grow sales in our Generics division. We also benefit from an attractive portfolio of products in our Branded Products division, including category-leading therapies for cough and cold, medical skin care sun protection, vitamin deficiencies and many leading brands across therapeutic areas in Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 75% of sales of our top 30 products in our Branded Products division were of products with a top-three market position in their respective countries. Many of these leading products have been category leaders in their respective markets for many years, providing us with an opportunity to leverage our local marketing expertise to drive the internationalization of these leading brands into new markets and further grow sales in our Branded Products division.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,"Competitive Advantage Through Scale, Local Market Expertise and Established Relationships","Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage over new entrants in our markets, bolstered by our scale and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies. The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement regimes and distribution channels. This provides an advantage to existing, large-scale players with a long history of local expertise, such as us. We are highly familiar with the regulatory requirements in our key markets and have developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory and distribution issues, which enables us to minimize the time and cost required to obtain regulatory product approvals while maximizing the number of countries we cover. Germany, for example, operates a public tender system that covers the majority of prescription generics sales, which necessitates a modestly sized sales team with significant tender experience. In Russia, on the other hand, the distribution of prescription generics products is mostly patient-driven after the first prescription, which significantly increases the need for a larger sales force targeting patients indirectly via doctors. Our local market experience means that we are adept at navigating these and other regimes and are able to serve each market with a tailored sales and distribution approach. Building on our long history and our origins as a pharmacy cooperative, we have developed deeply ingrained relationships with the key distribution channels in our markets, which we believe are difficult to replicate. We successfully pursue different business models tailored to local markets’ needs. Our sales forces are trained and experienced in identifying the right marketing strategy for each country, and we maintain a direct sales presence in approximately 30 countries, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors and internationalize successful brands.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,"Diversified Across Geographic Areas, Therapeutic Areas, Products and Brands","We are diversified across geographic markets, products, therapeutic areas, customers and suppliers, thereby limiting our exposure to any single product, geographic area and reimbursement system. We market our products in approximately 120 countries with largely uncorrelated end-markets. With more than 30,000 SKUs, we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and are not dependent on the success of any single product. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the top-ten products by sales in our Generics division accounted for only 18% of Generics sales, and the top-ten products in the Branded Products division accounted for only 37% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering is diversified across a large number of therapeutic areas and benefits from a high rate of new product launches, with a strong pipeline for the next four to five years. The combination of our Generics and Branded Products divisions provides us with significant benefits in terms of diversification and synergies. The pricing of prescription generics is regulated, and volume demand is relatively independent of economic conditions, such that our Generics business has historically delivered strong and stable sales and cash generation. Our Branded Products division, on the other hand, faces fewer regulatory requirements. OTC products can be brought to the market more quickly, and pricing is unregulated and driven by competition. As a result, our highly recognizable brands, customer loyalty and the lack of competition in certain specialty areas provide for attractive pricing for products in our Branded Products division. Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond 3 ----- relatively quickly to emerging consumer trends. Our presence in both divisions allows us to deepen our local market expertise and regulatory know-how; exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing; and maintain our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Furthermore, in 2019 approximately 71% of our production volume is manufactured in lower-cost countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and highly flexible production base. Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and 15 of our sites are required to comply with stringent EU standards and are EU certified plants. Moreover, local production helps provide a natural hedge for currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to further streamline and improve certain aspects of our manufacturing operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Our constant-currency sales increased at a CAGR of 7.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2019. We had Adjusted Cash Conversion of 85% and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although our Management Adjusted EBITDA margins have already improved (22% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively), we see significant additional upside in our ability to drive cost savings and further increase our margins. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements. We have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital movements, and management has maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a manufacturer of generics, we typically incur limited development expenses and no material research expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.7,Highly Experienced Management Team Supported by Committed Sponsors,"We have a highly experienced management team led by Peter Goldschmidt, who has been the Chief Executive Officer of STADA since September 2018 and draws on over 29 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry. Having held various senior management positions in Europe, Asia and the United States for the Novartis Group, Mr. Goldschmidt also served as the President of Sandoz USA and the Head of North America at Sandoz, where he rapidly expanded the company’s generics and biosimilar business, generating revenues of over $3 billion. He was also the global executive member for Central and Eastern Europe for Sandoz, leading Sandoz to a top ranking market position in generics and rapidly growing its OTC business. On February 1, 2020, Wolfgang Ollig joined our senior management team as our new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ollig has more than 15 years of experience as group chief financial officer in various industries, including medical, automotive and biotech. Most recently, Mr. Ollig served as chief financial officer of WSA A.S, a Danish company under private equity ownership that is the global leader in hearing aid manufacturing, with more than 10,000 employees and headquarters in Copenhagen and Singapore. Mr. Ollig has significant experience in capital markets transactions, having led automotive supplier Hella as chief financial officer in its 2014 initial public offering. Our leadership team also includes Miguel Pagan Fernandez who was appointed Chief Technological Officer of STADA on July 1, 2018, having previously served as the Head of Global Technical Operations (Solids and Special Technologies) of Novartis. In addition to our senior executive team, our business benefits from experienced and dedicated operational teams with a deep understanding of the healthcare and generics markets. Our management team has successfully grown our business to become the fifth-largest generics company in Europe and increased our sales from A2,330.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, to A2,608.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, through both organic growth and a number of strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Since the STADA Acquisition in August 2017, we also draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive and successful track record of investing in companies in the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital increased sales by 49% within two years and significantly 4 ----- increased the workforce at Bio Products Laboratory, creating a life sciences champion in the United Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large laboratory diagnostics companies, Synlab (Germany) and Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form Synlab Group (headquartered in Germany), the European champion in laboratory diagnostics. In addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury Pharma and Amdipharm, and merged the two businesses to create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented generics market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy centered on continued buy and build, further internationalization and applying best practice across both companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to TSX/Nasdaq listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion in 2015. Most recently, Cinven has acquired LGC, a global leader in the life sciences sector. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margins, while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both organically and through targeted acquisitions. Our recent revenue and profitability growth was driven by the Transformation Program that the Sponsors are implementing at STADA, which contributed to the significant increase in our EBITDA margin from 19% in the year ended December 31, 2018, to 22% in the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from global growth factors in the pharmaceutical industry, and as a large player highly diversified across geographic region, products, brands and production, we intend to continue to leverage our scale and broad local expertise to support our base business, improve our margins and expand our geographic footprints along with the markets in which we operate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Examples of our most recent acquisitions include our acquisition of five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe and selected markets in APAC and Latin America from GlaxoSmithKline, our acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine, our acquisition of the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals in the Philippines, our acquisition of the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland, our acquisition or multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the Takeda Acquisition our acquisition of a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe through the Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands.

At the same time, we intend to build on our key brands and to grow our Branded Products division by strengthening our market shares in our existing geographic region and introducing our local category leaders into new, international markets.

The Transformation Program targeted aggregate run-rate cost savings of more than A200 million by the end of 2021, which we aimed to realize through a number of strategic cost saving initiatives. Having commenced the initial implementation phase of the Transformation Program at the end of 2017, we had realized (i) approximately A52.0 million of cumulative cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (ii) approximately A108.8 million of cumulative cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2019. We are continuing the rollout of our Transformation Program and believe we are currently on track to realize additional incremental cost savings of approximately A45.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2020, which would bring our cumulative cost savings to A154.5 million. In addition, we expect cost savings of approximately A3.0 million in IT, the majority of which we expect to realize within the next 18 months, resulting in incremental cost savings of approximately A48.7 million.

For general and administrative expenses, we believe we can achieve cost savings by unifying our IT landscape across our footprint through consolidating IT systems and contracts, reducing non-personnel general and administrative spending, and optimizing advisory and supervisory board costs, while also optimizing our sales force structures by streamlining our legal entities. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately A32 million to implement the Transformation Program and develop a five-year strategy for the implementation of future cost saving measures.

For our business, which benefits from significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in capital expenditures broadly in line with historical capital expenditures. We expect improved cash flows and discipline in capital expenditures to provide a strong liquidity cushion for our ongoing business needs, which was further bolstered by our A400 million Revolving Credit Facility and the long dated maturity profile of our other principal sources of debt financing. In terms of risk management, we are partly naturally hedged for transaction currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the 6 ----- same country as the end consumer, but we also intend to continue to implement exchange rate hedging policies through natural hedge strategies and derivatives.

The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive across many aspects of society and has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, significant disruptions to businesses and capital markets around the world.

Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors. The holdings of the Sponsors in Bain Holdco and Cinven Holdco include minority holdings of certain co-investors, including Partners Group AG. 28APR202000460938 (1) As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Sponsors indirectly control (through intermediate holding companies) 96.10% of STADA’s issued share capital. See ‘‘Principal Shareholders.’’ (2) The Sponsors established a management equity plan at Lux TopCo for the benefit of STADA’s management. See ‘‘Management—Share Ownership.’’ (3) In connection with the STADA Acquisition, the Sponsors provided an equity contribution in the form of equity and quasi-equity (including common and preferred equity instruments and deeply-subordinated shareholder loans), the proceeds of which have been contributed to the Senior Notes Issuer through intermediate holding companies. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial _Information—Financial Information’’ and the Financial Statements included elsewhere herein._ (4) On September 29, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued A735.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024, and the Senior Notes Issuer issued A340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due 10 28APR202000460938 ----- 2025. The gross proceeds from the offering of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the 2017 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance amounts that were incurred under the bridge facilities which the Issuers had obtained in connection with the STADA Acquisition and to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Existing Notes. On February 13, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued A350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024, a portion of the gross proceeds of which we intend to use to finance the GSK Acquisition and the remainder for our general corporate purposes, including potentially additional add-on acquisitions. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments—2020 Tap Notes and GSK Portfolio Acquisition.’’ In addition, on November 29, 2019, we issued A600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% temporary notes. On March 3, 2020, the proceeds of such temporary notes were used to finance the Takeda Acquisition and, substantially concurrently with the completion of the Takeda Acquisition, we exchanged the entire aggregate principal amount of such temporary notes for an equivalent amount of additional 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments—The Takeda Acquisition.’’ (5) On December 4, 2018, the Senior Notes Issuer issued A250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7[1]⁄4% Senior Notes due 2025. The gross proceeds from the offering of the 2018 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) repay in full the senior bridge facility that was used to finance part of the purchase price for the acquisition by German Holdco of additional common shares in STADA pursuant to the delisting tender offer made by German Holdco for any and all outstanding STADA Shares not directly held by German Holdco and (ii) to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the 2018 Senior Notes. (6) In connection with the STADA Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement currently provides for committed facilities of A2,365.0 million and £266.0 million in the form of (i) Facility E2 in an amount of A260.0 million; (ii) Facility F (EUR) in an amount of A2,105.0 million; (iii) Facility F (GBP) in an amount of £266.0 million; and (iv) the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of A400.0 million. All of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U. guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on a senior basis, _pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and senior to the Senior Notes Guarantees. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations are, and the Additional Notes will be, secured on a first-priority basis by (v) a pledge of the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Senior Notes Issuer and a pledge of the material bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (w) a pledge of the shares in German Holdco, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by German Holdco to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and a pledge of the material bank accounts of German Holdco; (x) a pledge of the STADA Shares acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Holdco and a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by STADA to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Holdco; (y) a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by any Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement); and (z) pledges of the shares in each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U. and the material bank accounts (subject to certain exclusions based on the Agreed Security Principles) of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor. The existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities have been utilized by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, German Holdco and certain restricted subsidiaries. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities _Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ As of the date of this offering_ memorandum, each of Facility E2, Facility F (EUR), Facility F (GBP) and the Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in full. The commitments made available under these facilities may be increased in the future. (7) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is offering A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue the Additional Notes as additional notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which the Existing Senior Secured Notes were issued. We expect that the Additional Notes will be issued with more than _de _minimis OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Additional Notes will not be fungible for U.S. federal_ income tax purposes with the Existing Senior Secured Notes and will be issued with separate common codes and International Securities Identification Numbers (‘‘ISINs’’) than those assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes, but otherwise will have the same terms and conditions as the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Listing _and General Information.’’_ (8) On the New Issue Date, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The Senior Secured Notes Collateral also secures the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis. A portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the Shared Collateral, also secures the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. See ‘‘The Offering—Collateral.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the security and the liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain limitations. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior Secured_ Notes (including the Additional Notes) and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances. (9) On August 25, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated German Holdco as its wholly owned subsidiary and contributed all of the STADA Shares held by it as of such date to German Holdco and it also contributed any STADA Shares it subsequently acquired to German Holdco. German Holdco also wholly owns Nidda Healthcare Beteiligungserwerbs und verwaltungs GmbH, which is a holding, management and finance company with no material business operations, assets or liabilities. German Holdco may increase its shareholding in STADA using all or a portion of the proceeds from the Offering. (10) As of December 31, 2019, the book value of the aggregate principal amount of STADA Existing Debt was (i) A266.6 million of non-current obligations under the 2022 Notes, (ii) A48.5 million of non-current obligations under various promissory notes (Schuldscheindarlehen) and (iii) A40.1 million of bank loans. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ (11) For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accounted for 19.1% of the consolidated sales and 44.2% of the consolidated EBITDA of the STADA Group. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Notes 11 ----- Guarantors accounted for 51.8% of the consolidated assets of the STADA Group. The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the security interests and liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee are subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on _the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_ (12) As of December 31, 2019, we had local credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount equal to A40.1 million. Our local credit facilities consisted of (i) an unsecured loan facility in Serbia in a principal amount of RSD 4.3 billion (equal to A36.3 million) and (ii) an unsecured loan facility in Argentina in a principal amount of ARS 257.1 million (equal to A3.8 million). In addition, as of December 31, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and certain other transactions as described under ‘‘Capitalization,’’ certain of our subsidiaries in Russia would have had outstanding debt of RUB 22.2 billion (equal to A258.3 million based on the March 31, 2020 exchange rate).

As a result, we translate the financial position and results of operations attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under IFRS, but also on a constant-currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure, constant-currency sales. Constant-currency sales is used to adjust for the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro-denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this measure facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of the Group’s operations. For a reconciliation between the foreign exchange rates used for reporting purposes in our Financial Statements and the foreign exchange rates used for purposes of the calculation of constant-currency sales, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP _Financial Measures—Constant-currency Sales.’’_ (2) We define EBITDA (before leases) as earnings before interest (including interest expense on lease liabilities), taxes, depreciation (including depreciation of lease assets in connection with leases), amortization, impairment losses and rent expense. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. We define Management Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items as set forth below. We define Management Normalized EBITDA as Management Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted for certain normalization adjustments described below. We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Management Normalized EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-off and run-rate adjustments, expected cost savings and the impact of certain past and pending acquisitions as set forth below. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBITDA-based measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we present Non-GAAP Measures such as EBITDA (before 23 ----- leases), EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. In addition, we present EBITDA (before leases) to facilitate a comparison of our results of operations before the impact of different lease accounting standards and other rent expense. We believe this presentation is useful to investors, as our results of operations are presented in accordance with IAS 17 for all periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2018, whereas all periods thereafter are presented in accordance with IFRS 16. By adding back depreciation of finance lease assets and right-of-use assets in connection with leases, interest expense on lease liabilities and rent expense (which comprises, among others, the rent expense in accordance with the applicable lease accounting standard), we eliminate all expenses resulting from lease accounting and other rent expense and enable investors to compare our performance across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease accounting standard and other rent expense. Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information— _Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’_ Set forth below is a reconciliation of each of EBITDA (before leases), EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to earnings after taxes which we believe is their closest comparable IFRS measure.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As a result, the comparability of our EBITDA between these periods is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets and a decrease in rent expense. To facilitate a comparison of our results of operations across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease 24 ----- accounting standard, we present EBITDA (before leases). By adding back to earnings after taxes: (i) income taxes; (ii) financial income and expenses (excluding leasing); (iii) depreciation and amortization net of write-ups of non-current assets (excluding leasing); and (iv) a lease adjustment comprised of (I) depreciation of finance lease assets, interest expense on finance leases and rent expense (including operating lease expense and other rent expense not affected by lease accounting), and, respectively (II) depreciation of right-of-use assets, interest expense on lease liabilities and rent expense (including rent expense exempt from or not affected by lease accounting), we eliminate all expenses resulting from lease accounting and other rent expense and enable investors to compare our performance across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease accounting standard and rent expense on the basis of EBITDA (before leases). EBITDA (before leases) is then adjusted to include rent expense to arrive at EBITDA. (C) Relates to measurement effects due to purchase price allocations and significant product acquisitions, using the year ended December 31, 2013 as the baseline. With respect to the Senior Notes Issuer, the effects from purchase price allocations and product acquisitions relate to measurement effects due to the purchase price allocation for the STADA Acquisition. (D) Relates to fees paid for financial advisory, legal and other professional fees in connection with the STADA Acquisition and the Takeover Offer. (E) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary income and expenses. (F) Management Normalized EBITDA represents Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain normalization adjustments. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Management Normalized EBITDA, adjusted for (i) certain one-off, run-rate and cost savings adjustments and (ii) the estimated impact of the Takeda Acquisition, the Walmark Acquisition, the GSK Acquisition, the Fern C acquisition and the Opti Pharm acquisition. These adjustments are set forth in more detail below. In connection with the STADA Acquisition, we commissioned third-party due diligence reports to analyze STADA’s financial condition and operations and the potential for achieving cost savings at STADA. We have derived certain normalization, one-off, pro forma and cost savings adjustments from one of these reports, which we updated in connection with the Offering. Our normalization adjustments normalize certain income and expense items; our one-off adjustments adjust our results for certain events that could be considered one-off in nature; our run-rate adjustments adjust our results for the pro forma impact of certain acquisitions and disposals that we carried out after January 1, 2019; and our cost savings adjustments give pro forma effect to certain expected cost savings. In addition, we commissioned third-party due diligence reports to analyze the financial condition and operations of the Takeda CIS Assets and the Walmark Group and the potential for achieving cost savings and synergies following the completion of the relevant acquisition. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted to give effect to (i) the estimated run-rate impact of the Takeda Acquisition, based on unaudited carve-out financial information of the Takeda CIS Assets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, contained in such report, and (ii) the estimated run-rate impact of cost savings initiatives that we intend to implement or have implemented following the completion of the Takeda Acquisition. Furthermore, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted for the estimated run-rate impact of the Walmark Acquisition, based on unaudited carve-out financial information of the Walmark Group for the twelve months ended May 31, 2019, contained in such report (excluding expected synergies). The calculation of Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on various assumptions and estimates by external consultants and management. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the adjustments below. As a result, while we believe that these adjustments and potential cost savings are reasonable estimates, the actual results and cost savings in any given period may differ from those estimated herein. See also ‘‘Forward-looking Statements.’’ The presentation of Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is for informational purposes only. Neither Management Normalized EBITDA nor Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represent the results we would have achieved had each of the events or items for which an adjustment is made occurred on or prior to January 1, 2019. Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are included in this offering memorandum because we believe that each of these metrics provides a useful measure of our results of operations after giving effect to the initiatives described below; however, these numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm, and this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS. You should not consider Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as measures of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

(b) Represents certain legal, advisory, other professional fees and travel costs directly incurred in connection with certain past and pending M&A transactions. (c) Following completion of the STADA Acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring expenses related to (i) severance payments, headhunter costs and costs for leadership onboarding in connection with a restructuring of our senior management; and (ii) a bonus payment of A1.0 million to our executive management. (d) Represents the sum of (i) the costs we incurred in connection with the deconsolidation of our vaping businesses in the Netherlands and Germany and (ii) the negative EBITDA contribution of these businesses until the date of deconsolidation. (e) Following the insolvency of the Russian reseller Rosta, we wrote off our uncollectable receivables in the second half of 2017 but added 50% of the associated impairment charges back to EBITDA. In 2019, we recovered A2.8 million from Rosta’s credit insurer and hence management subtracted 50% of such income from our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. (f) Mainly relates to (i) prior period charges pertaining to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, but paid in the year ended December 31, 2019, of A5.4 million, (ii) non-operating loss of A1.0 million in relation to the sale of STADA Vietnam which was deconsolidated in December 2017 and disposed of in December 2019, (iii) costs incurred in connection with the review of our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of A0.7 million, and (iv) other non-operating expenses of A2.1 million. (g) Represents an adjustment in respect of foreign exchange losses (net of gains) incurred in connection with the borrowings and losses on hedging contracts in relation to the purchase price for the Takeda Acquisition. (h) Represents an adjustment in respect of the remaining 50% of the reimbursement for uncollectable Rosta receivables. (i) Represents a run-rate adjustment giving effect to our acquisition of a GSK’s Violet product portfolio in July 2019 as if such acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. 26 ----- (j) Represents a run-rate adjustment giving effect to our acquisition of Biopharma in December 2019 as if such acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. (k) Represents a run-rate adjustment giving effect to the annual royalty income our subsidiary, Bioceuticals, expects to receive from Pfizer. Pfizer distributes one of the products developed by Bioceuticals in the United States. While sales were ramping up in 2019 (especially in the U.S. market where sales started in May 2019), we believe they have reached a sustainable level. As a result, we have included a run-rate adjustment of A9.2 million to annualize the expected average annual royalty income. (l) Represents cost savings that we expect to realize from past and ongoing initiatives undertaken in connection with our Transformation Program, including (i) approximately A45.7 million of cost savings that we expect to realize in the year ending December 31, 2020 and (ii) approximately A3.0 million of cost savings in IT, the majority of which we expect to realize within the next 18 months. Excludes additional expected cost savings from further initiatives that we intend to implement after December 31, 2020.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may adversely affect our sales, margins and operations.","Our industry is highly competitive and is driven by a variety of factors, including price, reliability of quality, local market expertise, distribution channels, portfolio breadth, marketing, packaging and brand loyalty. Our two divisions, Generics and Branded Products, face intense competition from our competitors’ products. Many of our competitors are well known pharmaceutical companies with substantial financial and other resources. Companies with more resources may have a greater ability to conduct the development work necessary to obtain marketing authorizations. Our products could, for example, be rendered obsolete or uneconomical through the development of new products or technological advances in manufacturing or production by our competitors. Our competitors’ products may also be, or be perceived as being, more effective or more efficiently marketed and sold than our products. Our competitors may also be able to sustain a deliberate substantial reduction in the price of their products or services for longer periods. This is likely to result in significant price pressure in an increasingly commoditized market, which, in turn, may reduce our sales and market share. In addition, competition in certain of our markets is particularly intense due to the use of public tenders. Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical products have been implemented (by both public and private entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate, such as Germany, in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private entities do not directly set the prices of pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products); rather, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and governments or private entities select a winning bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing practices and the reimbursement of drugs. See ‘‘—Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender _systems could lead to delivery bottlenecks or an unintentional increase in inventories.’’_ The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by continuous product development and technological change. The entry of new players and products in any of our markets may make it difficult for us to increase our market share, retain existing competitive positions or access new markets at all. If we fail to maintain our competitive position, through either product development or effective marketing, or if any of our larger competitors engage in pricing competition with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm our business.","We are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulations. These regulations govern, among other things, the development, authorization, manufacturing and procurement of contract manufacturing, wholesale distribution and supply, pharmacovigilance and promotion of our products. See ‘‘Regulation.’’ While the regulations in the European Union are to a certain extent streamlined, the regulatory environment outside the European Union is fragmented and varies by country. Globally, we market our products in approximately 120 countries, mainly across Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States 29 ----- (‘‘CIS’’) region, the MENA region, Asia, Australia and South America, and each of these countries may regulate these areas differently. In our Generics division, we sell unbranded generic products mostly comprising prescription products. In most countries, the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly (for example, through statutory price reductions) or indirectly (for example, through reference prices and reimbursement rates payable by the health insurance system, mandatory discounts, terms and/or requirements concerning discounts, the creation of framework conditions to stimulate market forces and competition). Pricing also may be influenced by supranational regulations in the European Union. Any changes in these regulations or procedural rules, such as those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the profitability of individual products and, in exceptional cases, could render the market introduction of a new product unprofitable. The regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate rigorously monitor and enforce compliance with the relevant regulations by pharmaceutical companies, and our operations are subject to periodic inspections by the relevant regulatory authorities in our markets. As a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, we are, for example, subject to principles of good manufacturing practice (‘‘GMP’’) and good distribution practice (‘‘GDP’’), and compliance with these principles is assessed by the competent regulators via site audits. See ‘‘Regulation—European Union—European Union Pharmaceutical Regulatory _Regime—Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing’’ and ‘‘Business—Procurement, Production and Quality Management—Highest Quality and Safety Standards.’’ Following these inspections, the relevant regulator_ may issue notices listing the conditions that inspectors believe may violate GMP, GDP or other applicable regulations, and warning letters that could modify certain activities identified during the inspection. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, the total or partial suspension of production or distribution, the suspension of the review of our product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution, as well as reputational harm, reduced sales and market share. Moreover, the production of biologics and biosimilar products is subject to particularly complex regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to production failures, recalls or fines. In addition, we could incur substantial remediation costs. If any of these risks materialize, our sales could be materially and adversely affected. While we believe that we are taking adequate measures to mitigate the regulatory risk, there can be no assurance that, should regulatory scrutiny further increase, they will continue to be effective. In addition, continuing compliance with increased regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase our costs. We also have affiliations, in licensing agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory approvals of their processes and products. These third parties are subject to similar regulatory compliance. If any of those third parties does not comply with our regulatory requirements, we could be adversely affected if their non-compliance results in an interruption in our supply of raw materials or ingredients or, in the case of any of our licensors, it hinders our ability to produce our in-licensed products. Any failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers or licensors to comply with governmental regulations, or any regulatory action taken against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

For example, international conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the political situation in certain countries in which we operate, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, and the impact of the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, may adversely affect the macroeconomic environment. See ‘‘—We operate manufacturing facilities and sales entities and have significant sales in Russia, which has _experienced conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be the subject of national and international sanctions,’’ ‘‘—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our business’’ and ‘‘—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto may materially affect our business and results of operations.’’ These events have influenced, and may continue to influence, the development_ of our sales in the relevant markets. While sales in our Generics division, which mostly comprises nondiscretionary prescription products, are less vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, our results of operations in the Branded Products division, which mostly comprises self-pay OTC products, is more sensitive. An economic downturn and lower household incomes can significantly depress demand in the 30 ----- self-payment market, i.e., the market for pharmaceutical products for which consumers are not reimbursed as part of their personal national health insurance plan. We believe that we are particularly exposed to a deterioration in the Russian economy. Russia accounted for A263.9 million, or 10%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, Russia’s recent economic deterioration had, and any future downturn (including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic) may have, a particularly negative impact on our sales. In addition, the United Kingdom accounted for A250.0 million, or 10%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019, 88% of which was in Branded Products. As a result, we believe we are also exposed to any deterioration in the UK economy, and there can be no assurance that Brexit (as defined below) or other factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, may not result in a decline in the economic condition of the United Kingdom. Moreover, one of our largest markets in the Generics division, Spain, which accounted for A113.5 million, or 7%, of our generic sales in the year ended December 31, 2019, is still experiencing a period of political and economic uncertainty. Since the beginning of 2019, the situation in Catalonia calmed down in connection with the proclamation of independence by the Catalan regional parliament. The court rulings of the Spanish Supreme Court against prominent Catalan politicians in October 2019 have again escalated the tensions in the conflict. It remains to be seen to what extent the Spanish government will succeed in reducing the uncertainty in the region resulting from the pro-independence movement and thus the uncertainty about the possible outcome of political and social tensions in Catalonia. The escalation of the conflict related to the independence of Catalonia from Spain led to boycott campaigns against products and suppliers that are headquartered in Catalonia, including STADA, and there can be no assurance that new boycott campaigns will not be carried out again, either in Catalonia or in the rest of Spain. Our Generics division is also exposed to fluctuations in the economy to the extent economic, political and regulatory factors induce cost containment reform measures in any country, which could affect reimbursement rates and our sales of prescription drugs. For example, the sustained economic downturn in Spain has resulted in a number of cost containment measures in recent years. See ‘‘—Existing and future _healthcare cost containment reform measures by government health authorities or government-sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business’’ below._ Any of these factors, or others that we cannot anticipate, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,Existing and future healthcare cost containment reform measures by government health authorities or government- sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business.,"In various countries where we operate, government health authorities provide healthcare at a low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. The continuing increase in healthcare expenditure has therefore been the subject of considerable government attention in many of the countries in which we operate, particularly as public resources have been stretched by the global economic crisis. Furthermore, in recent years, the increasing average age of the population and the associated increasing demand for pharmaceutical products has led to rising healthcare costs. Increasing expenditure on healthcare has been the subject of considerable public attention. In recent years, many countries across the globe have discussed or implemented a measure of healthcare reform. The primary focus of these reforms was to introduce cost containment measures and optimize governmental healthcare spending, particularly for prescription drugs, which account for a major part of our sales. Measures implemented in line with these reforms are fragmented and vary by country. The Russian government, for example, has released a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (‘‘VEP’’) that are subject to mandatory price caps. Overpricing can result in fines and other penalties. Certain European countries have introduced numerous austerity measures to lower healthcare spending, including mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules. In certain cases, reimbursements for high priced drugs were refused. The United Kingdom and Germany introduced new systems to determine the cost-effectiveness of drugs, which will decide the reimbursement level for a drug. In Spain the government’s pricing and reimbursement policy is focused on cost containment measures as they attempt to reduce their financial deficit, which has repeatedly resulted in price cuts, reductions to wholesale and retail margins and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs since 2000; we believe the pace at which these regulatory measures are enacted has accelerated in recent years. The Spanish government has also enacted four royal decree laws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical industry by means of price 31 ----- reductions for older pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs and medical devices, and limitations on the number of products eligible for a reimbursement under the Spanish National Health Service. Certain countries also cut their healthcare expenditure budgets or fixed them at a particular amount. Furthermore, mandatory price cuts were introduced in respect of both generic and patented drugs. As of the date of this offering memorandum, many countries are in the process of implementing further healthcare cost containment measures in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. For example, under a draft law published in Germany on April 21, 2020, the Ministry of Health would be entitled to intervene in order to ensure a continuous supply of certain categories of medicines to the entire population. Moreover, according to a regulation published in Germany on the same day, pharmaceutical companies which sell specifically pandemic-related medicines are required to to set their prices close to their cost of production, and surcharges related to the pandemic are explicitly prohibited. See also ‘‘Regulation.’’ While most of our Branded Products are non-reimbursable OTC drugs, which are generally less affected by the above measures, those measures may affect our Generics division, which mostly comprises prescription products, in a number of ways. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any Generics product we currently distribute or will develop in the future. As a result, we may be disincentivized from developing and marketing new products or from entering new markets. Existing regulations that affect the prices of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before our products are approved for marketing. Our products may not be considered cost-effective or adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an adequate return on our investment. The governments of the countries where we operate may, in the future, implement further regulations that impose additional pressure on the price of pharmaceutical products, including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Any of the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

See ‘‘Regulation’’ and ‘‘—We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these _regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm our business.’’ Although less onerous than for originator pharmaceutical companies, the process of_ obtaining marketing authorizations and other regulatory certifications, licenses and approvals to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming and costly. Depending on the country and therapeutic area, the issuance of an approval may take two years, or even longer. As the authorization process is time consuming, we may be unable to realize the momentum for the launch of new products, which may result in the loss of sales and market share. To the extent that we are unable to secure timely approvals for new products, we will depend on our existing products to maintain our sales. There can be no assurance that these products will continue to remain competitive and generate sufficient sales over time. There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval of any application we submit for the commercial sale of a product in time, or at all. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in respect of our products could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or delaying the introduction of new products. If health or safety concerns arise with respect to a product, we may be forced to withdraw it from the market and could face legal action if any harm came from the use of such product. For example, in September 2019, the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (‘‘BfArM’’) and the European Medicines Agency (‘‘EMA’’) informed us that there has been a recall in the European Union of medicinal products containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (‘‘API’’) ranitidine, produced by the API manufacturer Saraca Laboratories (India). The reason for the recall is indications of possible nitrosamines impurities, which are considered carcinogenic, in ranitidine produced by Saraca Laboratories (India). In the Balkan countries, we use a dossier with the ranitidine API produced by Saraca Laboratories (India). Although as of the date of this offering memorandum we have not received any instructions from the local authorities in the Balkan countries to recall our products containing this API, we understand that the Serbian authorities are currently in contact with the German authorities and therefore there is a risk that the Serbian authorities will follow the BfArM and also order a recall of products containing ranitidine. Furthermore, our products must be 32 ----- successfully registered in the markets in which they are commercialized. For example, in the Generics division, a significant factor in the development and approval of each product is the strict observance of commercial property rights, such as patents and supplementary protection certificates. Moreover, if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a drug, it may be limited with respect to the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for the drug. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our pharmaceutical products could result in restrictions on the use of a drug, including possible withdrawals of the drug from the market. Any delays in obtaining governmental approval or authorization of new or existing products may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As a result, we do not typically incur material research expenses. As a generics company, however, we incur development costs in connection with marketing authorizations and the production of our new products, as well as other activities that facilitate their commercialization. As a result, future results of operations depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The development, manufacturing and commercialization process is time consuming. We must develop, test and manufacture our products as well as successfully register them in each relevant jurisdiction. All our products must meet and continue to comply with regulatory and safety standards in each of the markets in which they are to be commercialized. There can be no assurance that the necessary marketing authorizations will be obtained in a timely manner or at all and delays or the inability to obtain regulatory approval could adversely affect our business. See ‘‘—Obtaining and _maintaining necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products is time consuming, and may not in each instance prove successful.’’_ Our products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as expected or may face greater than expected competition. In addition, our new products may be unable to achieve their planned value. The successful development and manufacture of new products also depends on our ability to secure, on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, the required raw materials.

However, there can be no assurance that our provisions will be sufficient to cover our actual litigation costs. In addition, third-party litigation, including litigation related to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law, patent law and the implementation of individual regulatory requirements in the provision of healthcare at a national or supranational level, could have an indirect, materially adverse impact on us and the market environment in which we operate. 33 ----- As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved in 12 pending general litigation cases. Although we currently only consider one of these disputes related to our operations in Serbia as material, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation claims or similar matters under various laws or that product specific provisions will be sufficient to cover litigation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing litigation under the laws of certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any materially adverse effects on our business in such country. For example, one of our subsidiaries in Russia was recently held liable by a Russian court for damages of approximately A26 million in connection with its purchase of a product portfolio. The Russian subsidiary has filed an appeal against this decision within the statutory deadlines. Any of these events could result in considerable costs, including damages and legal fees, and a temporary or permanent ban on the marketing of certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or the proprietary rights of third parties. Originator and generic pharmaceutical companies are increasingly patenting not only the relevant molecules or manufacturing processes relating to a final dosage product, but also the formulations and production processes of active pharmaceutical ingredients. While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon the commercial property rights of other parties, we believe that patent infringement claims are typical of our industry. While we generally take great care in ensuring that the new products we launch do not violate any intellectual property rights of third parties and seek to refrain from selling products prior to the expiration of their patent protection, there can be no assurance that an intellectual property infringement claim could not be brought against us and that we would not be found to infringe on the commercial property rights of others. This is also due to the fact that, in certain countries, such as Italy, patent applications are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and, therefore, we may not be aware of currently filed patents. In addition, even if our searches in the registers indicate that patents or other intellectual property rights have expired, there can be no assurance that originators or other parties that previously held such rights will not subsequently seek to restore their patents. If any application to restore intellectual property rights were granted after we had started marketing a product, we could be found to violate such rights and become liable for damages to their owners. We may also be subject to other legal action preventing or impeding our future marketing of the subject product. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved in 7 pending patent infringement lawsuits. We believe that the claims alleged in these pending patent infringement lawsuits have no merit and that we will not be required to make any material compensation payment. We may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, selling or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement. Furthermore, a significant third-party claim could result in management’s attention being distracted from current operations. The outcome of intellectual property related proceedings could adversely affect, hinder, delay or prevent the manufacture, use, marketing or sale of our products or processes. We may also be required to pay substantial damages or change our product offerings or expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products or processes. Any of the above could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes. We rely, in part, on license, collaboration and other agreements to develop our product portfolio. For example, we occasionally enter into research and development partnerships with universities. The underlying collaboration agreements may provide that we are granted the exclusive license to commercialize the final product. Our present and future licenses, collaborations and other intellectual property related agreements may impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized 34 ----- manner, we may be required to pay damages and our licensors may have the right to terminate the license. If our license or other intellectual property related agreements are terminated, we may be required to cease developing and commercializing drug candidates that are covered by the licensed intellectual property. In addition, our licensing, collaboration and other agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected drug candidates. For example, such disputes may relate to: (i) the scope of rights granted under the agreement and other interpretation related issues; (ii) the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the agreement; (iii) the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; (iv) our diligence obligations under the agreement and which activities satisfy those diligence obligations; (v) the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our collaborators; (vi) the priority of invention of patented technology; and (vii) in the case of joint developments, the ownership of intellectual property rights. To help protect any proprietary know-how we develop and any inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we may have to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that all our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors who have access to our trade secrets and confidential information will agree to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Even where such persons entered into such agreements, these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon the development of the relevant program or drug candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s net assets, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

These risk exists even with respect to products that have received, 35 ----- or may receive in the future, regulatory approval for commercial use. Moreover, our products could contain contaminated substances that we have not identified during our manufacturing process, and adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. We could also be subject to product liability claims as a result of defective raw materials we purchase from third parties. Product liability lawsuits could be costly to defend, and could result in reduced sales, substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or customers, harm to our brand and reputation, the inability to commercialize products that we develop and diversion of management’s time, attention and resources. Considerable sums in damages have been awarded in certain countries against pharmaceutical companies due to physical harm allegedly caused by the use of certain products. Product liability claims may force us to withdraw some of our products from the market, thus creating the potential for further claims. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims would likely result in negative publicity, decreased demand for any products that we may develop, injury to our reputation and the suspension or withdrawal of clinical trials, and require us to incur significant legal fees. We currently have insurance coverage for product liability claims. See ‘‘Business—Insurance.’’ However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all or even a material part of a significant product liability claim.

Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products or brands, or the brands of our in-licensed products, could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed care providers, pharmacies and other retailers, customers and patients. In addition to the strength of our brand and reputation, acceptance of any of our products among the medical community depends upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due, in part, to strict regulatory requirements governing their 36 ----- manufacture. We rely on complex machinery and information technology systems to support our manufacturing processes, as well as internal and external communications with respect to supplies, quality control and distribution. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials and environmental factors. If problems are severe, we may be forced to temporarily suspend all or part of our production until the problems are rectified. The actions taken by several countries in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including severe restrictions of movements, may prevent our employees, contractors and suppliers from conducting business activities, which may disrupt manufacturing at our facilities around the world as well as our supply chains and, in turn, may adversely impact our ability to source raw materials in time, or at all, and to meet the demand for our generic and consumer healthcare medicines. Any of the foregoing are likely to result in increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to perform existing contracts, time spent investigating the cause, remedial costs and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. In addition, where problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be forced to recall products from the market. For example, complying with a directive by the competent European authorities, we recalled all affected batches containing the Valsartan active ingredient that were supplied by our Chinese supplier in July 2018. We also proceeded with a second recall in September 2018, due to the contamination of a few batches at the production facilities of Hemofarm AD. In certain cases, we may face product liability claims and incur respective costs. See ‘‘—Our reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to _product liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived.’’ The facilities used to manufacture our_ products are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the relevant principles of GMP. See ‘‘—We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these _regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm our business.’’ While we manufacture most of our products, others are manufactured by our contract_ manufacturing partners. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with the principles of GMP and believe that we diligently monitor our suppliers’ compliance within the applicable requirements, we do not control the day-to-day activities of, and we are dependent on, the contract manufacturing partners for their compliance with GMP requirements. If we or any of our suppliers were to violate the applicable principles of GMP, we or such supplier could be fined, and the competent regulator could impose a complete shutdown of such supplier’s noncompliant manufacturing plant. As a result, we could become subject to a supply shortage with respect to the products we source from the sanctioned supplier. If our inventories of these products turn out to be insufficient, this could adversely affect our sales. For example, in June 2018, our Serbian subsidiary Hemofarm AD received notice of an impurity detected in one of the active ingredients (Valsartan) used in our production. This active ingredient was supplied by one of our Chinese suppliers who has now been sanctioned, and therefore we are facing a shortage in the supply of Valsartan. As a result, we may be in breach of our own delivery contracts and may be liable for damages to our customers. In particular, our German discount agreements provide for contractual penalties in the event we fail to perform our obligations in full or at the time contemplated by the agreement. Although we may have recourse against our suppliers, our recovery may be subject to contractual or equitable limitations as well as the solvency of our suppliers and be insufficient to offset the damages payable to our customers. If our manufacturing partners or we cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our specifications and the strict requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities, our manufacturing contractors and we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our respective manufacturing facilities. If a regulatory authority does not approve a facility for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities. Although we carry out compliance checks, the occurrence or suspected occurrence of production not in line with our specifications or regulatory requirements can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls and enforcement action, with consequential damage to our reputation and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause manufacturing delays, substantial expense, lost sales and the delay of new product launches.

Examples of our acquisitions in 2018 include the acquisition of the rights to the anti-dandruff shampoo Nizoral in Europe and the MENA region, the purchase of trademark rights to Hedrin in Belgium, Spain and Portugal, the product rights for APO-go in Germany and Scandinavia, the acquisition of the majority stake in Bioceuticals, a German manufacturer of the active ingredient and finished product erythropoietin, being marketed to both third-party customers and STADA sales companies, the repurchase of all European trademark rights to Ladival, and the acquisition of Ketodol. Examples of acquisitions in 2019 include the acquisition from GlaxoSmithKline, through our British subsidiary Thornton & Ross, of five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe as well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and the acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. We believe that none of these acquisitions materially affected the comparability of our results of operations. In addition, in March 2020, we completed the Takeda Acquisition through which we acquired the Takeda CIS Assets, a portfolio of selected products sold, inter alia, in Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan and the Walmark Acquisition, through which we acquired a leading manufacturer of consumer in Eastern Europe headquartered in the Czech Republic. Acquisitions are part of our strategy, and we intend to selectively explore strategic acquisitions in the global generics and OTC markets, with a focus on target companies and/or pharmaceutical assets that allow us to leverage our existing platform and realize meaningful synergies. Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. While we conduct due diligence in preparation for each acquisition, it is possible that legal, tax and operational risks of the respective target, some of which may be unknown or undisclosed to us at the time of the acquisition, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, may materialize, have more severe consequences than expected or increase the costs for the integration of a target. For example, the Walmark vendor has informed us that one of Walmark’s competitors in Bulgaria has filed a claim with the Bulgarian antitrust authorities against Walmark’s Bulgarian subsidiary, alleging unfair practices by Walmark. The Bulgarian authorities have dismissed the claim but the claimant has appealed. This may potentially result in Walmark’s Bulgarian subsidiary facing a fine of up to approximately A0.8 million and subsequent actions for damages by the injured parties. In addition, we could become liable for overdue payables of a target or acquired company to suppliers or employees that are not currently known to us or we could become subject to historic tax or pension liabilities of which we are not currently aware of and we may underestimate historic or future tax or pension liabilities in relation to target or acquired companies. In conducting our due diligence for the acquisition of a target, we may be required to rely on external resources, including public information, information provided by the relevant vendor and information from third-party consultants and advisers. For example, in connection with the Takeda Acquisition and the Walmark Acquisition we were required to rely on information provided by the Takeda and Walmark vendors. There can be no assurance that the due diligence we undertook in connection with these or other acquisitions has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating these or other acquisitions. Any such unknown or previously underestimated liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Additional Notes. In addition, acquisitions are also subject to the risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the payment of consideration greater than the target market value. Also, we may be unable to evaluate the scale of a potential acquisition, which may result in being unable to allocate proper resources to execute the acquisition and subsequent integration efficiently. The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent, among other things, on the successful integration of the products and businesses we acquire at the expected costs, and their subsequent expansion into new markets or into the existing markets in which we operate. Such integration and expansion require substantial time and focus from management and may put a strain on our management resources, distracting our managers from their regular tasks and require additional management resources to be deployed, especially where a large-scale acquisition is involved, which could adversely affect their ability to operate our business. Although we believe that our current managerial, administrative, technical and financial resources are capable of supporting our recent and proposed future expansion, there can be no 38 ----- assurance that our existing resources will be sufficient for this purpose, or that we will be able to acquire the necessary additional resources on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may be unable to deploy sufficient resources to integrate a large-scale acquisition, including the acquisitions of the Takeda CIS Assets, Walmark and the assets to be acquired from GlaxoSmithKline, which may result in us being unable to realize desired synergies, operational efficiencies and cost savings. We may not be able to realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such operational efficiency and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors, including increases in expenses related to such acquisitions. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, may offset the expected cost savings from the acquisitions. There is also a risk that key employees of companies we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully commercialize products and technologies that we acquire, may seek employment elsewhere, including with our competitors. Any failure to acquire, maintain and deploy adequate management, sales, administrative, technical and financial resources to support our expansion could undermine our acquisition strategy. In addition, our acquisitions of target companies or product portfolios may be subject to regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for our future acquisitions without unreasonable expenses and within a reasonable time period or at all. Our failure to integrate acquired businesses and products, or to realize the intended synergies, may prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes. In addition, we may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties provided in connection with the acquisition of a target and our ability to recover losses suffered as a result of such a breach may be limited. In connection with the acquisitions of the Takeda CIS Assets and Walmark, the respective vendors have given certain customary representations and warranties and indemnities. Nonetheless, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities Takeda and the Walmark vendors have agreed to retain, and we may not be able to enforce any claims against Takeda or the Walmark vendors relating to breaches of these representations and warranties. The liability of Takeda and the Walmark vendors under these agreements is very limited. Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these representations and warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, if either Takeda or the Walmark vendors become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of Takeda’s or the Walmark vendors’ breach may be limited by the liquidity of Takeda or the Walmark vendors or the applicable laws governing applicable bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such breach of applicable representations and warranties, we could incur losses which could in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Any of these events could also result in a decrease of the market shares we currently hold in the relevant markets in which we operate or with respect to the products we manufacture. While we believe that our production facilities maintain sufficient insurance to cover any such property and other asset damages, depending on the risk and type of asset or property insured, any losses related to a serious accident, equipment malfunction or other unexpected event could exceed the amount of this coverage, and subsidiaries whose business solely consists of the management of intellectual property rights and the receipt of royalties do not normally carry business interruption insurance at all. In addition, the refurbishment or reconstruction of any of our production facilities or the construction of new facilities could be subject to regulatory approval by the competent health authorities of the jurisdictions in which they are located as well as the health authorities of some or all of the jurisdictions to which products from such facilities are exported, which could result in significant delays in the resumption of product manufacturing.

These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination, events of noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal injury, property damage, and claims and litigation resulting from such events. If an accident occurs, or if contamination is discovered, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages or fines, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes. We are currently not aware of any material contamination incidents or material noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws. The environmental laws of many jurisdictions in which we operate may impose potential obligations to clean up contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites that we acquire, own or operate, which we formerly owned or operated, or for which we may otherwise have retained liability or where waste from our operations was disposed. Were such environmental cleanup obligations to arise they could significantly reduce our operating results. In particular, any financial accruals that we may make for these obligations might be insufficient if the assumptions underlying the accruals proved to be incorrect, or if we are held responsible for additional contamination. Stricter environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities for us, and could result in handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants being subjected to more rigorous scrutiny by relevant regulatory authorities than is currently the case. Compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures, as well as other costs, thereby potentially harming our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In addition, some of our major supply and wholesale contracts are subject to change of control provisions that may grant the respective counterparties the right to terminate the relevant contracts as a result of a change of control, which in certain but not all contracts may shorten the termination or contract period originally contemplated under the contract. At the end of a contract’s term, which may be accelerated as a result of a change of control termination, these suppliers or wholesalers have a choice to either renegotiate their contract with us, increase or decrease its scope (with our consent), seek out our competitors to provide the same or similar services or cease outsourcing the relevant activity. Whenever a contract expiries or is due for renewal, suppliers and wholesalers may seek a price adjustment from us. In addition, these parties may seek a price adjustment when their business experiences significant volume changes. Furthermore, certain suppliers or wholesalers may seek to increase prices previously agreed with us due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the supplier or the wholesaler. If our contracts are terminated either by a material supplier or wholesaler (for example, as a result of a change of control event being triggered) or not extended upon their termination, if our material suppliers or wholesalers shift business away from us, or if we are unsuccessful in retaining high renewal rates and contract terms that are favorable to us, this can cause delays and may have a material adverse effect on our business and our respective operating divisions, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Under such tender systems, governments or private entities do not directly set the prices of pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products) but manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and governments or private entities select a winning bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing practices and the reimbursement for drugs. 40 ----- Initially, the tender system in Germany resulted in intense price-based competition, which pushed the pricing of generic products to a marginal-cost level. Although competition subsequently decreased and margins have partially recovered, as many smaller competitors proved unreliable in terms of their ability to fulfill large orders, there can be no assurance that new entrants will not intensify the level of competition again. Moreover, tender systems implemented by governmental institutions or public health insurance organizations could determine fluctuations in national markets, leading to changes in large volumes in the demand for pharmaceutical products. These fluctuations have a direct consequence on our business. Even if we undertake great efforts to avoid delivery bottlenecks or an unintentional increase in inventories by way of scenario calculations and specific operational positioning of the respective supply chain, these events cannot generally be ruled out due to our extensive portfolio.

Active ingredients and auxiliary materials are generally available from multiple suppliers and often sourced locally. We acquire these ingredients and auxiliary materials directly from the suppliers or enter into contracts with manufacturers producing the pharmaceutical products. Increased prices, rationing or shortages as well as fluctuations in prices can occur. In some cases, we manage these risks through mechanisms aimed at reducing our financial exposure, such as price escalation clauses (which link procurement prices to current selling prices) and specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes.

Both our operations and those of our local sales and business partners in these countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflicts; bribery and 41 ----- corruption; national and regional labor strikes; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; the deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting the production, pricing and marketing of products; anti-trust risks; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions, market opportunities and operating restrictions; and changes in financial policy and the availability of credit. We have identified potential misconduct in our Russian operations. The alleged activity includes overpayment for advertisement and supplies, improper distribution of gift cards to pharmacies and conflict of interest of a few local top managers in certain procurement and distribution arrangements as well as the registration of intellectual property rights in the name of third parties when it was possible to register such rights on behalf of our Russian subsidiary. We conducted an internal investigation into these matters and retained external advisers. As a consequence of our findings, certain employees were dismissed and a new management team was installed, and relevant processes and controls were redesigned to address the compliance violations identified. We identified approximately A24.5 million of funds that were potentially misdirected over a period of time in these schemes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover our losses, if any, and there may be tax consequences related to un-reclaimable VAT and potentially challenges due to deductions of costs in previous tax returns resulting from payments associated with these activities. We also from time to time receive whistleblower complaints from our employees and third parties. These complaints are often vague and ambiguous and have in the past occasionally proven to be false. In addition, some allegations are unspecific without any concrete information or evidence. As a result, whistleblower complaints oftentimes require substantial preliminary assessments of credibility before they can be progressed and investigated to mitigate the risk of liability for false allegations. Although we thoroughly evaluate whistleblower complaints as a matter of urgency, there is a risk that the alleged wrongdoing continues until we have completed our initial assessment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we or any of our local business partners may be subject to legal proceedings regarding bribery and corruption in these countries, and we are unable to ensure or monitor the lawful conduct of our business partners’ operations, though we try to mitigate this risk by having anti-bribery provisions in our contractual arrangements and structural measures such as compliance trainings and audits to verify adherence to our compliance standards.

Russia accounted for A263.9 million, or 10%, of our sales in 2019. Russia has experienced conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries, including Ukraine. As a result of these conflicts, Russia has become subject to national and international sanctions (including sanctions by the European Union and Ukraine, which are the most relevant to STADA’s business) some of which impose restrictions on imports from Russia. These sanctions, coupled with low commodity prices, the devaluation of the Russian ruble against other major currencies and high inflation, contributed to the decrease in our financial 42 ----- performance in Russia since 2014, which affected both our sales and earnings. Some of these sanctions have been extended in light of the continuing turmoil in Ukraine. While certain countries exempt pharmaceutical products, such as ours, from the scope of their sanctions, no such exemption applies under the Ukrainian sanctions regime. Historically, because we served the Ukrainian market through supplies from our presence in Russia, these sanctions prevented us from making any sales into Ukraine which adversely affected our sales and profitability. While our acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine in 2019 has provided us with domestic capabilities to serve the Ukrainian market, our ability to fully serve such market remains limited by the aforementioned geopolitical factors. Furthermore, the Ukrainian sanctions regime prohibits both our Ukrainian operations and their financing banks from making payments into Russia. In addition, there is a risk that these countries may further expand the scope of their sanctions against Russia and that other countries will impose similar sanctions in the future. See ‘‘—We are subject to risks associated with cross-border sales and _purchases.’’_ Moreover, our manufacturing facilities in Russia could be disrupted by the conflict with Ukraine or by other wars, political unrest, terrorist activity or economic upheaval. Any such disruption could cause losses in efficiencies, delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us for our losses. Furthermore, our operations in Russia may be subject to risks arising from a less stable legal and regulatory framework and less-transparent enforcement of the law. This could result in, _inter alia, increased difficulty in enforcing contracts, collecting trade receivables, the imposition of additional regulations, an increase in taxes or restrictions of the import of products.

Although pharmaceutical products are generally excluded from the scope of sanctions, our exports and transfers could be impacted by such sanctions, which would limit our ability to trade with sanctioned individuals and/or sanctioned countries and create practical complications for our exports, especially in terms of our interaction with banks and receiving payments from sanctioned countries. For example, the competent authorities could require banks to withhold payments due to us from sanctioned customers or countries. The European Union and other countries have also enacted sanctions that prohibit transactions by their citizens and domiciled entities involving certain specially designated individuals and entities from sanctioned countries or participating in sanctioned activities including but not limited to terrorism and drug trafficking. In addition, the European Union, the United States and certain other countries have recently implemented measures against Russia in connection with the continuing turmoil in Ukraine.

Although the withdrawal agreement came into effect on January 31, 2020, and provided for a transitional phase until December 31, 2020, the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU following such transitional phase is subject to ongoing negotiation and it is not yet possible to predict under what conditions such withdrawal will take place or whether it will be a regulated or unregulated withdrawal. Brexit could, among other outcomes, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union, cause political and economic instability in other countries of the European Union, including in our main markets (such as Germany, Italy and Spain), contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the euro and an increase in cost pressure in the European healthcare system resulting, for example, in price reductions for our products. Brexit might also affect our ability to maintain the current level of sales in the United Kingdom, accounting for A250.0 million, or 10%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Following the outbreak of Covid-19 in other countries, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Covid-19 constituted a pandemic. In February 2020, Covid-19 was reported in northern Italy and has thereafter spread across Europe as well as to several other countries around the world. Covid-19 has resulted in severe restrictions on movement being imposed or considered in various countries, including countries where we manufacture and sell our products, such as Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, including national and supranational responses thereto, we and our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners risk being prevented, fully or partly, from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Restrictions on travel, the imposition of quarantines, shelter in place orders, business shutdowns and other measures imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic could disrupt our supply-chains, reduce availability of raw material such as active pharmaceutical ingredients or personnel at our manufacturing sites and could adversely impact our ability to source and transport raw material including active ingredients, bulk products and finished products, as well as materials commonly used in the manufacturing process in the global healthcare industry. Suppliers may be unable to manufacture and supply ingredients needed for our products on a timely basis due to restrictions to, and disruptions in, their supply chains or labor forces or declarations of force majeure on their own part or on part of their sub-suppliers. Any of the aforementioned restrictions may impact the performance of our third-party contractors, may have a material adverse effect on the timely completion of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which may become significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate, and may cause delays in regulatory submissions and grants of any regulatory approvals, any of which may cause us to incur additional costs.

Prices of generics typically decline, especially as additional generic pharmaceutical companies (including low-cost generic producers based in China and Vietnam) receive approvals and enter the market for a given product and competition intensifies. Consequently, our ability to sustain our sales and profitability on any given product over time is affected by the number of new companies selling such product and the timing of their approvals. In addition, intense pressure from government healthcare authorities, particularly in highly regulated European markets, to reduce their expenditures on prescription drugs has resulted in lower pharmaceutical pricing, causing decreases in sales and profits. Furthermore, brand pharmaceutical companies continue to defend their products vigorously. For example, brand companies often sell or license their own generic versions of their products, either directly or through other generic pharmaceutical companies (so-called ‘‘authorized generics’’). No significant regulatory approvals are required for authorized generics, and brand companies do not face any other significant barriers to enter into such market. Brand pharmaceutical companies may also seek to delay introductions of generic equivalents by a variety of commercial and regulatory tactics (such as obtaining and enforcing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire, questioning the quality and bioequivalence of generic pharmaceutical products, developing controlled-release or other slightly modified versions, which often reduce demand for the generic version of the existing product for which we are seeking approval, changing product claims and product labeling, developing and marketing OTC versions of brand products that are about to face generic competition or trying to extend the duration of their patents). These actions may increase the costs and risks of our efforts to introduce generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can potentially be life-threatening. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product, and harm the business of companies, including ours, or lead to litigation. In addition, it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products could mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product.

Although we believe that we currently comply with all our material obligations under these licenses, should we breach any such obligations, our counterparties may be entitled to terminate the licenses. This may restrict, delay or eliminate our ability to continue commercializing these in-licensed products, which could adversely affect our business.

The loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key management, scientific, technical or sales personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and financial condition. We face competition for scientific and technical personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. Such competition is also enhanced by the reduction of specialized personnel in certain key functional areas, such as engineers in Germany. In addition, increasing demand for higher wages may make it difficult for us to retain the necessary personnel.

We make continuous investments to appropriately adapt these complex and high-performing systems to changing business processes. Such systems are vulnerable to a number of problems, such as software or hardware malfunctions, malicious hacking, physical damage to vital data centers and computer virus infection. In addition, the information technology system needs regular upgrading to accommodate expansion of our business and maintain the efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in our system, we could experience significant business and operational delays across our businesses. In particular, any breakdown in our information technology systems could result in disruptions in our research, development, manufacturing, accounting and billing processes. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.

For example, we are subject to extensive European laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection, the main and most relevant of which relate to the collection, protection and use of personal and business data, including EU Regulation 2016/679 (the ‘‘General Data Protection Regulation’’ or ‘‘GDPR’’). In particular, we adapted our internal procedures to the requirements imposed by the recently implemented GDPR. The costs of complying with the GDPR are increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. Any failure to comply with data protection laws such as the GDPR may result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation. However, given the size of our operations, data breaches may occur a result of human error or events beyond our control, such as external hackings, malware infections, malicious user activities, internal security breaches and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access to our premises. For example, in September 2019, we filed a report with the relevant German authority concerning a potential data breach according to the GDPR. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not received a response to this report and we cannot predict when an answer will be given. Additionally, it is not possible to predict the amount of the fine that the relevant German authority may impose in the event it ultimately finds that there was a violation. Although German supervisor authorities have not yet imposed fines over A30.0 million (which is in general possible under the GDPR for very serious violations), we cannot predict if the German authorities will find there was a data breach violation and, if so, the amount of the fines they will impose. Moreover, data protection laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, and could make us liable in the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cybersecurity breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access. We and our customers and suppliers who carry out our outsourcing, have been in the past and could be in the future subject to breaches of security by hackers. A future breach of our system or that of one of our customers or outsourcing partners may subject us to material losses or liability, including fines, claims for unauthorized use of personal and sensitive data or other claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or regulations, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have policies and procedures in place to seek to prevent such breaches and carry out detailed root cause analysis on any breach that does occur in order to ensure that similar occurrences do not arise. However, if a single material breach or series of less material breaches was to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws, could lose the goodwill of our clients and could have our reputation damaged, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In addition, there is the risk that, in a difficult economic and financial environment, national healthcare systems may delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners, thus generating or increasing default or counterparty risks. Furthermore, default and counterparty risks from social health insurance providers (‘‘SHIs’’) have increased due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. For example, in Germany, rebate agreements with SHIs require pharmaceutical companies to ensure uninterrupted delivery capability. In the event that we are unable to complete relevant deliveries, including for causes 47 ----- that might be related to Covid-19, we would be subject to contractual penalties and/or compensation claims. Although we could claim that contractual performance has been rendered impossible for factors and events attributable to Covid-19 and potentially invoke force majeure clauses, where available, we would need to prove that any such factors and events fall within the scope of such clauses and that our specific inability to perform deliveries is directly attributable to the applicable factors and events, any of which may be difficult or impossible to prove, particularly in light of the complexity of the pharmaceutical industry supply chains. In addition, according to a new German regulation published on April 22, 2020, pharmaceutical companies are required to reasonably ensure an adequate and continuous availability of certain critical medicines in order to ensure sufficient supplies to meet demand for the entire population. Accordingly, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from fulfilling purchase agreements if the order volumes are intended for individual stock-piling and would lead to general shortages. However, in such instances pharmaceutical companies would be entitled to claim the relevant compensation from the government. While we strive to maintain business relations with business partners of good financial standing and adopt suitable measures to safeguard us against default risk, including guarantees, letters of credit, credit insurance or the transfer of assets, it cannot be ruled out that these measures may be insufficient. In addition, in certain developing markets, we rely on third-party distributors and other agents for the marketing and distribution of products, who may have inadequate internal compliance resources.

These battery-powered products enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide and are marketed as alternatives to traditional tobacco cigarettes and cigars. Although vaping products do not currently account for a material portion of our sales, with respect to such products, we are exposed to long-term health related risks. Because vaping products were recently developed, the medical profession has not had a sufficient period of time in which to study the long-term health effects of vaping product use. As a result, it is unclear how safe vaping products are for their intended use, or whether they may pose risks different from those posed by traditional cigarettes and cigars. For instance, recently some U.S. states initiated a sales ban on e-cigarettes. If the medical profession were to determine conclusively that vaping product usage poses long-term health risks, vaping product usage could decline and we could be exposed to the risk of litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are in currencies other than the euro, our reporting currency, and as such our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British pound sterling and Serbian dinar. Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our and their respective functional currencies. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate sales in another, any change in the values of those currencies could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are greater or less than our liabilities denominated in a different currency, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and movements in the foreign exchange markets. Where we are unable to match sales and receivables denominated in foreign currencies with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results of operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies into our euro reporting currency. For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency 48 ----- items as of December 31, 2019 showed that in financial year 2019, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately A2.0 million. At the same time, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency in relation to the British pound sterling of 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately A24.9 million. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes. We generally employ different financial derivatives to counter the risks associated with assets, liabilities and anticipated future cash flows denominated in foreign currency. However, to the extent that such financial instruments are not sufficient or not effective or due to a default risk of the relevant counterparty, fluctuations of local currencies could affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

There is a risk that tax authorities in individual countries will assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax-transfer pricing model and address retroactive tax claims against one of our companies. While our tax-transfer pricing model has been agreed between the competent authorities in certain countries, in others such model is still under discussion with the authorities. For example, transfer pricing agreements are currently under discussion between the German and the Italian tax authorities.

In addition, as a consequence of our acquisition strategy, we regularly recognize significant amounts of goodwill on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, we had intangible assets of A4,794.9 million of which A559.6 million related to goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized over its useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once a year (the impairment-only approach) and additional reviews may be carried out if indications of impairment become apparent. In the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. All intangible assets other than goodwill are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. If, on the reporting date, there are indications that these intangible assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is reevaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. We recognize the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount as impairment loss in the income statement. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist for these assets, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and in all other cases showing indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell is determined using the relief from royalty method. We recognized intangible assets with an indefinite useful life in connection with our acquisition of the STADA Group for the brands STADA and Hemofarm. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the acquisition cost. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally evaluated in the context of annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to verify whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist. The amount of impairment losses that we are required to recognize in the future may be significant, particularly in the event of material acquisitions or products that perform below our expectations.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Designation Date’’), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Participations’’) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured Creditors’’) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. 52 ----- Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may at any time provide immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles. If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that it may in its discretion require until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes (such as indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured Notes Collateral consisting of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.’’_ Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior Secured Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in the event of a default.

See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ Not all of our assets will secure the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture allows the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes. While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany and Russia, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the security documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness 54 ----- secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Additional Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions.

By accepting an Additional Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Additional Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors owed to holders of the Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as applicable (‘‘Principal Obligations’’). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and do not, or will not, directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes do not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There is a rebuttable presumption that the ‘‘centre of main interest’’ as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the enforceability of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. 57 ----- In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes return any amounts paid under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests is limited to the amount that will result in such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also ‘‘—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other _limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.’’_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or 58 ----- - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that both the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Senior Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral is not in the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In relation to public limited liability companies (Aktiengesellschaften, ‘‘AG’’) strict German capital maintenance rules as set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, ‘‘AktG’’) apply. Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or security interests provided by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company (such as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will be, unless a specific exception applies, considered disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose of supporting the financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and, therefore, invalid. Investors should note that STADA is incorporated in Germany in the form of an AG. According to the wording of the law, both the prohibition of financial assistance as well as the capital maintenance requirements described above are not applicable while a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) exists between the AG and the shareholder on whose instructions the relevant guarantee and/or security interest is granted. However, neither the Senior Secured Notes Indenture nor the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contain any covenant requiring the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its respective subsidiaries to take any efforts to implement or maintain a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement. Furthermore, even in case a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement is in place and provided that certain other requirements are met, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries (whether or not to support the acquisition of such AG) may be considered to be in 59 ----- violation of the capital maintenance rules and financial assistance restrictions, in which case such guarantees and security interests can be void, unenforceable, restricted and/or subject to a redemption claim against the beneficiary. In particular, under the prevailing view in German literature, the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement exemption only applies if payments under the guarantee or enforcement of the security interests, as applicable, do not cause the dominated entity (i.e., the AG) to incur a balance sheet loss for which it cannot reasonably expect to be compensated for by the dominating entity due to the financial condition of the dominating entity. Therefore, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by an AG, including STADA and any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called ‘‘limitation language’’) contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any other document governing the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. With respect to the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement exemption, such contractual enforcement limitations will apply notwithstanding the existence of a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement if and to the extent the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as applicable, provided by an AG, including STADA and/or any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, will or is expected to, result in an annual loss of the respective AG and such annual loss would not be, or cannot be expected to be, compensated for by a compensation claim under the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement that can be accounted for in the balance sheet of STADA at full (vollwertig). Furthermore, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, ‘‘GmbH’’) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, including by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are subject to certain contractual limitations (so called ‘‘limitation language’’) contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any other document under which any Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. The pledge over STADA shares is granted by German Holdco and is subject to ‘‘limitation language.’’ Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG or AG may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 of the German Civil Code (BGB) and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, amongst others, the third-party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG or AG or other third-party creditors of such entity. As a result, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s Guarantee or the security provider’s Senior Secured Notes Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or Senior Secured Notes Collateral apply, the Senior Secured Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider. Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

Interests in the global Additional Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Additional Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Additional Notes.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Additional Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Additional Notes representing the Additional Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Additional Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Additional Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Additional Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.

In such a situation, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Senior Secured Notes that are tendered under any such offer.

Given the STADA Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our 65 ----- Group’s results.

In particular, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limit the ability to upstream cash to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or transfer as profits under a profit and loss transfer agreement, if applicable, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due.

The draft bill intends to broaden the existing rules on corresponding inclusions and deductions of income and expenses and introduces provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and, furthermore, introduces new arm’s-length provisions on intercompany financing that may ultimately limit the deduction of interest expenses on intercompany loans. If the draft bill is enacted and depending on the final wording of the new legislation, the introduction of aforesaid rules could result in higher taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the OECD BEPS-Initiative. In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carry-forwards which have partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax loss carry-forwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a five-year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carry-forwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carry-forwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. Currently, a proceeding is pending at the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) whether forfeiture upon ownership changes of more than 50% are constitutional. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set-off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carry-forwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss carry forwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal unity. 67 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure,13.3.5,We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility.,"The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures contain covenants which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; - make certain restricted payments and investments; - transfer or sell assets; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries; - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us; - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes; - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and - pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity. All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the _Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to_ finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’ Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the_ Revolving Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Additional Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then-outstanding amount under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (including the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures one year before the Senior Secured Notes and two years before the Senior Notes), the Additional Notes or any other debt that have incurred or may incur in the future, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Additional Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Additional Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure,13.3.7,"Existing and future drawings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any future variable interest rate debt we incur in the future bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.","A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which are based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (in each case subject to a zero floor if less than zero) plus an applicable margin (based on a margin ratchet). These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Additional Notes. Neither our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of inter-bank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate 69 ----- EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (‘‘SONIA’’) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on branded and unbranded generics, with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 30,000 SKUs covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA region, Asia, South America and Australia. We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales and we ranked ninth among OTC companies in Europe as of December 31, 2019. Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective manufacturing footprint comprising 21 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building on our tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each year since 2014. Our solid pipeline of new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated sales of A2,608.6 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of A885.3 million. The products we sell are classified according to two divisions: Generics and Branded Products. Generics:_ Within our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations of originator drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics division is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 18% of sales in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling products (and their respective therapeutic areas) in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Epoetin zeta (anemia), Tilidine, Tilidine/Naloxone (pain), Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Omeprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), 78 ----- Pantoprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Diclofenac (pain, anti-inflammatory), Paracetamol (pain), Bisoprolol (high blood-pressure), Amoxi-Clavulan (antibiotic), Fentanyl (analgesic). The largest countries by sales in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia, Russia, France and Switzerland. We generated sales of A1,534.7 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A439.3 million in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019. Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products division primarily includes branded OTC products, which are typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests, cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-go (Parkinson’s disease). The market for products in our Branded Products division is generally characterized by market-driven pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty being important factors for success. Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 37% of sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling brands (and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Bortezomib (anti-cancer medication, prescription required multiple myeloma), APO-go (Parkinson’s disease, prescription required, available in 28 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in 28 countries), Zoflora (household disinfection), Snup (rhinitis), Aqualor (rhinitis, sore throats, available in 18 countries), Nizoral (anti-dandruff shampoo), Hirudoid (anti-coagulant), Vitaprost (prostate diseases) and Versatis (local anesthetic). The largest countries by sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Italy. We generated sales of A1,073.9 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A298.0 million in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Operating Divisions,17.2.1,,"We report our results of operations in two divisions, Generics and Branded Products, which accounted for 59% and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our divisions transact business with each other in the ordinary course of their operations. In accordance with transfer pricing rules, services between our divisions are charged at market prices. Products are assigned to each of our divisions on the basis of our marketing strategy. Marketing of generics is generally price-driven, where we are dependent on reimbursements, and high product quality is a necessary consequence of the stringent standards set by regulators. Where we determine that we are competing in such an environment, and therefore mainly compete on the basis of price and our efficient cost structure, we classify products into the Generics business. This mostly applies to prescription products that are most heavily regulated and generally reimbursable. Where we are free to set the price of our products, we classify them into the Branded Products division. This mostly applies to nonprescription products that do not depend on reimbursements, but also to those of our prescription products that have an established, highly recognizable brand and significant customer loyalty or low levels of competition. Our OTC products and medical devices are globally assigned to the Branded Products division. Due to factors such as differences in prevailing regulation and reimbursement regimes, brand recognition and competition, the classification of our products may differ between countries. It may also vary over time due to regulatory dynamics, with regulators redesignating prescription products as nonprescription products or discontinuing the reimbursement of prescription products. Redesignations are only effective for future periods and never apply retroactively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Beginning with our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we have discontinued reporting our results of operations by country, and we do not intend to report such financial information going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.4.1,Regulation,"Our industry is extensively regulated by a number of international and local regulatory authorities to ensure that pharmaceutical products are effective and safe for use. Regulatory provisions typically require us to obtain marketing authorizations before we are permitted to introduce new products into a market, which drives our development costs. Other regulatory provisions establish high standards for the quality of our products, services, raw materials, manufacturing and working conditions, which influence our cost of sales, selling expenses, and general and administrative expenses. In addition, regulation significantly affects our pricing of products and profitability. In certain markets, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Serbia, the costs of prescription products are generally eligible for reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs. However, regulators set a reference price for each pharmaceutical ingredient or substance group, which is a price limit that caps the amount government health programs will reimburse. Pricing regulation generally benefits generics companies such as us compared to manufacturers of branded originator products. However, regulators may decrease their reference prices from time to time. Tenders are another cost containment measure, primarily being employed by public institutions with governments looking to source pharmaceuticals at the lowest price. Germany has a well-established public tendering system that covers the majority of generic sales, in which we have operated successfully during the periods under discussion. Similar tender systems are operated in the Netherlands and Spain. In Italy, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions such as hospitals. Cost containment measures by regulators and governments may also result in the redesignation of prescription products as OTC products or the discontinuation of reimbursement for prescription products. We believe that these measures play to our strengths, as end-consumers in need of pharmaceuticals that are no longer reimbursable are more likely to prefer inexpensive generics such as our products over costlier originator products. Similarly, a reclassification of a prescription product into an OTC product means that price regulations no longer apply, thereby creating opportunities for us to leverage our brand recognition to charge premium prices.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.4.2,,Factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition include the factors described below. 79 -----,N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Volume Growth,17.5.1,Economic Conditions,"We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry, which is generally regarded as a noncyclical industry. Noncyclical industries are characterized by a low correlation between the demand for their products, which are typically nondiscretionary in nature, and fluctuations in general economic conditions. We believe that sales in our Generics division, which mostly comprises nondiscretionary prescription products, are relatively independent of the economic conditions in our markets. As prices are mostly regulated, frequently reimbursable by government or other health systems and with sales partly driven by chronic diseases, volume demand in the Generics division is relatively stable throughout the economic cycle. However, the state of a local economy may encourage governments to initiate cost containment measures. Such measures may be favorable for us if they accelerate the transition from originator products to generics or generics to branded OTC products, but they may be unfavorable if they lead to lower reference prices. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 82% of our sales in Spain, 89% of our sales in Belgium, 85% of our sales in France and 81% of our sales in Serbia derived from the sale of Generics. The state of the economy, however, impacts our results of operations in our Branded Products division, which mostly comprises self-pay OTC products. The lack of reimbursement means that sales of OTC products partly depend on consumers’ disposable income and general financial situation. A significant portion of our Branded Products is nondiscretionary, such as pain relievers, cough and cold medicines, sunscreens and diagnostics. However, some of our Branded Products are lifestyle driven and discretionary in nature, such as cosmetics and vitamin supplements.

We adjust our results to remove the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. In 2019, we adjusted our results for losses incurred with respect to a loan denominated in British pound sterling, and in connection with hedging activities denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our respective functional currency. We currently operate 21 manufacturing facilities in twelve countries, and sell our products in approximately 120 countries. As a result, a significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in non-euro currencies. Where we are unable to match sales received in a foreign currency with expenses paid in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that we are generally able to match sales with expenses incurred in the same currency, such that part of our foreign exchange transaction risk is naturally hedged. We also use derivatives such as currency futures and swaps to mitigate foreign exchange risk. We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, in the preparation of our Financial Statements we must translate assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all our operations with a functional currency other than the euro into euro. Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates may increase or decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, income and expenses, even if their value has not changed in their local functional currency. Our principal exposure to translation effects relates to the British pound sterling, Russian ruble and Serbian dinar.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

We seek to leverage acquisitions to unlock internal potential for organic growth, meaning that we typically acquire either companies that we can use as a platform for our expansion into new geographic markets or product portfolios that we can roll out in our numerous existing markets. Our focus in terms of acquisitions is on markets that have high growth potential and on Branded Products, as this division is characterized by a lower degree of regulation than Generics. For example, in 2018, we acquired a majority stake in Bioceuticals; the distribution rights to Nizoral, an anti-dandruff shampoo, in Europe and the MENA region, the trademark rights to Hedrin in Belgium, 81 ----- Spain and Portugal, the product rights for APO-go in Germany and Scandinavia, and the European trademark rights to Ladival. In 2019, we acquired five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, APAC and Latin America from GlaxoSmithKline, and Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer Health Business in the Philippines, the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland, multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines in Russia/CIS from Takeda, and the Walmark Group, a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands. We also from time to time evaluate divestment opportunities. Although we have completed several acquisitions and disposals during the periods under discussion, no individual acquisition or disposition materially affected the comparability of our results of operations. The Takeda Acquisition represents our largest acquisition since January 1, 2017. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, a third-party due diligence report estimated that the Takeda CIS Assets generated EBITDA of approximately A55.6 million (excluding synergies). In addition, we have acquired, and may continue to acquire, additional shares in our existing subsidiaries from time to time.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Particularly in our large and mature markets product launches can be a key driver behind sales growth, as was the case especially in Germany and Spain during the periods under discussion. Most of our product launches relate to new Generics. Because Generics are not usually broadly advertised, these product launches have no material impact on our marketing expenses. In our Branded Products division, however, our marketing expenses correlate with the number of product launches, as the introduction of a new product is typically accompanied by extensive marketing campaigns. When we launched our successful and fast growing sleep aid Hoggar Night, for example, we incurred significant marketing expenses for a TV advertising campaign. We launched 729, 650 and 670 products in the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For example, recent product launches include Bortezomib (used for the treatment of multiple myeloma), Movymia (used for the treatment of osteoporosis) and Dasatinib (anti-cancer medicine). The number of marketable products that we are able to launch in any year is partly driven by regulation and the availability of new products and is thus partly outside our control. As part of our strategy to expand globally into new markets, we are also launching internationally products that have been particularly successful in their domestic markets. Recent examples include the launches of Hedrin, Hoggar night, Fultium and Fructosin in the Portuguese, Austrian, Belgian and Swiss markets, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

According to IQVIA, sales in the global generics market (top 66 countries) increased from A212 billion in 2017 to A216 billion in 2018 and to A225 billion in 2019, and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2020 to 2024. Based on IQVIA data, the major European generics markets (Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy) are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% on average from 2020 to 2024. We believe growth in the global pharmaceuticals market is being driven by long-term trends such as population growth, aging societies, the increased incidence of chronic disease, advances in medical therapies, increasing self-medication and health awareness. Growth in the global generics market was additionally driven by increasing generics penetration in the global pharmaceuticals markets, due to cost containment regulations incentivizing the use of generics to counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs and recognizing that generics provide a high quality and lower-cost alternative to originator products. Another key driver behind increasing generics penetration is a wave of patent expirations. In the generics space, we expect biosimilars to play an increasingly important role in the future, as they can contribute significantly to cost control in national healthcare markets. In 2018, in Germany, the value of biologics losing patent protection exceeded that of small-molecule pharmaceuticals losing patent protection. We also expect regulators to continue the trend of reclassifying prescriptions into OTC therapies, thereby stimulating growth in the self-payment and self-care markets. According to IQVIA, the global OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2020 to 2024 and the European OTC market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.9% over the same period. 80 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, we have recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases that had previously been classified as ‘‘operating leases’’ under the principles of IAS 17. We recognized a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing our obligation to make lease payments. We elected to 82 ----- apply the modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16 and the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, being January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, some of our facilities were leased and we also had vehicle leases and a number of lease arrangements with office and equipment suppliers. The adoption of IFRS 16 has impacted the following balance sheet line items as of January 1, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018: - intangible assets increased by A7.1 million; - property, plant and equipment increased by A51.9 million; - other non-current financial liabilities increased by A 38.9 million; and - other current financial liabilities increased by A20.1 million. As a consequence of adopting IFRS 16, our EBITDA has been slightly positively impacted as rental expense has been replaced with depreciation of our right-of-use assets and notional financing charges on future lease liabilities. As a result, figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be comparable to the results presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Although German Topco has consolidated STADA and its subsidiaries since August 22, 2017, the comparability of the STADA Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements (including the reconciliation to the Senior Notes Issuer’s consolidated financial information contained therein) may be limited. For example, certain consultancy costs related to the STADA Acquisition were incurred by German Topco and the Issuers and only a portion of the debt incurred by the Issuers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement in connection with the STADA Acquisition was on-lent to STADA to refinance a portion of its STADA Existing Debt.

Expenses due to provisions for warranties are deducted from sales on the basis of estimates that are based on past experience expressed as a percentage of sales. Discounts granted to health insurance systems are recognized as a reduction of sales, based on the relevant contract. Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recorded in the same period. Expenses related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are realized.

We do not engage in material proprietary research for new active pharmaceutical ingredients, and our product portfolio is focused on products that do not require proprietary research. As a result, we typically do not incur material research expenses. Development costs are costs that result from the technical implementation of theoretical discoveries in production and production processes and facilitate their commercial implementation. As a rule, it is the objective of our drug development process to obtain national or multinational marketing authorizations for our products, to capitalize all development costs incurred in relation to these authorizations and recognize them as intangible assets. As described under ‘‘—Cost of Sales,’’ we then amortize these intangible assets as part of cost of sales. Whenever development costs do not satisfy the requirements for capitalization, we expense them in the periods in which they are incurred and report them under the line item development costs. Costs related to the development of new products are usually capitalized, whereas costs for technical and regulatory maintenance or the optimization of existing products are usually expensed as development costs. Development costs must satisfy the following criteria in order to be capitalized: (i) it is technically possible for the relevant product to become marketable or otherwise available for use in our business in the future (which generally equates to the grant of a marketing authorization); (ii) we have the intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, to achieve the marketability or utility of the relevant product; (iii) it is probable that the future economic benefits accruing from the intangible asset will flow to the Group; and (iv) the cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

(2) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro-denominated sales in each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period. (3) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by products that were sold in both periods that are being compared. (4) Represents audited financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The adjustment in respect of currency effects increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 by A19.7 million. The adjustment primarily reflects the positive currency effects of the British pound sterling, the Russian ruble and the Serbian dinar. The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 by A60.2 million. The adjustment primarily reflects the consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG since September 30, 2018 as well as the sales contributions from the acquired medical dandruff shampoo Nizoral product portfolio and the skincare product portfolio acquired from GSK. _Constant-currency Sales_ Constant-currency sales increased by A240.8 million, or 10.2%, to A2,601.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A2,360.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Sales by Operating Division Generics_ Reported sales in our Generics division increased by A151.9 million, or 11%, to A1,534.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A1,382.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher sales volumes in Germany, the United States (where we have a license agreement with Pfizer for the distribution of a product developed by Bioceuticals), Italy, Spain and France. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the Generics division increased by A110.5 million, or 8%, to A1,534.7 million, from A1,424.2 million. Generics remained stable at 59% of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the previous period. Our top five active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales of A188.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 12% of total sales in the Generics division, compared to A135.7 million, or 10%, in the year ended December 31, 2018. With sales of A78.1 million, an increase of A48.5 million, or 104%, from A29.6 million in the previous period, Epoetin Zeta was the best-selling active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Generics division in the year ended December 31, 2019. 87 ----- _Branded Products_ Reported sales in our Branded Products division increased by A125.9 million, or 13%, to A1,073.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A948.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the Branded Products division increased by A87.4 million, or 9%, to A1,073.9 million, from A986.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of reported sales was primarily the result of increasing sales in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. Branded Products accounted for 41% of reported sales in both years. Our top five Branded Products accounted for sales of A268.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 27% of sales in the Branded Products division, compared to A215.8 million, or 25%, in the year ended December 31, 2018.

This increase was mainly due to higher depreciation and amortization resulting from new product acquisitions, which offset the positive effects from better procurement conditions and lower inventory costs due to a lower impact of purchase price allocations than in the year ended December 31, 2019. _Selling Expenses_ Selling expenses increased by A43.0 million, or 8%, to A581.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A538.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

This increase was primarily due to consultancy expenses in relation to the Sponsors’ Transformation Program. _Research and Development Expenses_ Research and development expenses slightly increased by A0.5 million, or 1%, to A72.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A72.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Other Income_ Other income decreased by A35.6 million, or 51%, to A34.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to non-recurring income in the year ended December 31, 2018 in relation to the revaluation effect resulting from the capital consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which was previously accounted for using the equity method. _Other Expenses_ Other expenses increased by A63.1 million, or 45%, to A204.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A141.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher impairments on intangible assets and increased severance payments as well as foreign currency losses. _Financial Results_ Financial results increased by A54.2 million, or 21%, to a loss of A203.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from a loss of A258.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in financial expenses in connection with one-off evaluation effects relating to the DPLTA resulting from the Delisting Offer. 88 ----- _Income Taxes_ Income taxes decreased by A28.9 million, or 183%, to a tax income of A13.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from a A15.8 million tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Key Earnings Figures_ Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2019 benefited from favorable trends in the Generics division in Germany, the United States, Italy, Spain and France as well as in the Branded Products division in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy, linked with successful product launches and growth of top products. _Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit_ Reported operating profit increased by A98.5 million, or 249%, to A138.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A39.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

(2) Prior to 2018, adjusted sales for the current financial year were adjusted for currency effects compared with the previous year and for portfolio effects from new acquisitions. Due to the inclusion of historical exchange rates and the disregard of the current portfolio, we are of the opinion that future sales potential is not sufficiently reflected in this figure. Since the 2018 financial year, all portfolio and currency effects have therefore been allocated to the previous financial year in order to determine organic growth, and adjustments for currency and portfolio effects are shown solely as an adjustment to previous year sales. The currency adjustment of the previous year’s sales is made using the exchange rates of the reporting year. The portfolio effects consider the sales of the previous year as well as the sales of the reporting year, with the adjustment only applied to the previous year’s figure. (3) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period. (4) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like for like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by products that were sold in both periods that are being compared. (5) Represents audited financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The net changes to the portfolio as an adjustment to the reported sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled A41.3 million, or an adjustment of 2%. The changes to the portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled A11.2 million, primarily due to the acquisition of branded products in Argentina, the Nizoral product portfolio and the majority acquisition of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, and as a retrospective adjustment to the previous year totaled A52.5 million, primarily due to the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd (‘‘STADA Vietnam’’). We showed a negative currency effect resulting from the translation of local sales contribution into euro of A54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or an adjustment of 2.4% to the reported sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. _Constant-currency Sales_ Constant-currency sales increased by A151.3 million, or 6.8%, to A2,360.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A2,209.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. 91 ----- _Sales by Operating Division Generics_ Reported sales in our Generics division increased by A21.2 million, or 2%, to A1,382.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A1,361.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was mainly due to increased sales in Europe and increased sales in Germany. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the Generics division increased by A61.3 million, or 5%, to A1,382.8 million, from A1,321.5 million. Generics remained stable at 59% of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the previous period. Our top five active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales of A 135.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, or 10% of total sales in the Generics division, compared to A128.9 million, or 10%, in the year ended December 31, 2017. With sales of A38.0 million, an increase of A1.5 million, or 4%, from A36.5 million in the previous period, Tilidine Naloxone was the best-selling active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Generics division in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Branded Products_ Reported sales in our Branded Products division slightly decreased by A 4.3 million to A948.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A952.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the Branded Products division increased by A51.0 million, or 6%, to A948.0 million, from A897.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in adjusted sales was primarily due to increased sales in Germany and the United Kingdom. Branded Products accounted for 41% of reported sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our top five Branded Products accounted for sales of A215.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, or 23% of sales in the Branded Products division, compared to A220.9 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2017. With sales of A71.3 million, an increase of 3.1 million, or 5%, from A68.2 million in the previous period, the Parkinson’s medication APO-go was the best-selling active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Branded Products division in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales decreased by A38.5 million, or 3%, to A1,139.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A1,178.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to improved purchasing conditions. _Selling Expenses_ Selling expenses increased by A24.1 million, or 5%, to A538.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A514.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing expenses in connection with product launches, particularly in Europe and CIS. _General and Administrative Expenses_ General and administrative expenses decreased by A16.0 million, or 8%, to A183.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A199.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to cost savings and lower-costs for consultancy services. _Research and Development Expenses_ Research and development expenses increased by A4.8 million, or 7%, to A72.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A 67.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an extension of the APO-go product portfolio. _Other Income_ Other income increased by A43.1 million, or 104%, to A84.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A41.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the capital consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which was considered to be a special item in the financial year ended December 31, 2018. 92 ----- _Other Expenses_ Other expenses decreased by A100.2 million, or 49%, to A103.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A203.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower severance payments and reduced impairments on trade accounts receivable as well as reduced costs for consultancy services. _Financial Result_ Financial result decreased by A9.4 million, or 21%, to a loss of A35.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from a loss of A44.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest expenses as a result of the refinancing of STADA Arzneimittel AG in 2018 at interest rates between 0.95% and 2.3% per annum, compared to between 0.8% and 4.23% per annum for the previous year. In addition, the Group also financed itself at interest rates between 2.84% per annum and 3.19% per annum, compared to between 2.9% and 5.5% per annum for the previous year. _Income Taxes_ Income taxes decreased by A20.6 million, or 39%, to A32.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A53.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the change in tax status of STADA Arzneimittel AG. As a consequence, all deferred taxes from the previous parent company were transferred to the new parent company, Nidda BondCo GmbH, while STADA Arzneimittel AG was responsible for taxes on recurring compensation payments. _Key Earnings Figures_ Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from favorable trends in the Generics division in Germany and Europe as well as in the Branded Products division in Germany and the United Kingdom. _Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit_ Reported operating profit increased by A185.8 million, or 97%, to A378.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A 192.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

The EBITDA margin in Generics was 26%, compared to 21% in the previous period.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.42,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.42.1,Overview,"Our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis are our operating cash flows and financing cash flows from drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility and factoring facilities. The availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facility, are subject to certain conditions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn in an amount of A400.0 million. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments.’’ Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Covid-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our results and liquidity. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments.’’ As of December 31, 2019, the Senior Notes Issuer had cash and cash equivalents of A207.1 million (excluding A612.4 million of gross proceeds from our issuance of Senior Secured Notes to fund the Takeda Acquisition, which were recorded as other financial assets, deposited into escrow pending completion of the Takeda Acquisition and released from escrow on March 3, 2020) 95 ----- and we had A400.0 million in borrowings capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (excluding A5.2 million of undrawn letters of credit). As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the transactions set forth under ‘‘Capitalization’’, the Senior Notes Issuer would have had cash and cash equivalents of A1,197.7 million and we would have had no remaining borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, having borrowed A394.5 million and issued letters of credit in respect of trade liabilities in an amount of A5.5 million. In addition, since December 31, 2019, we have used A145.0 million of cash to acquire additional shares in one of our subsidiaries. We believe that, based on our level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under factoring facilities and local facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures and to service our debt for at least the next twelve months. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, legal prohibitions on such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses or other events could further reduce the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries. We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future financing cash flows will be limited by the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may have important negative consequences for you. See ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured _Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our_ cash flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Additional Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage. The proceeds from the Offering will be used as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

This increase was primarily due to a significantly higher gross cash flow resulting from a significant increase in EBITDA. There were also cash inflows in connection with the increase in trade accounts payable, which were countered by higher cash outflows resulting from the increase in inventories and trade accounts receivable. 96 ----- _Cash Flow from Investing Activities_ Cash flow from investing activities decreased by A35.3 million, or 12%, to a cash outflow of A265.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from a cash outflow of A300.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to significantly lower payments for investments in intangible assets. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we made payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A161.7 million, as compared to A280.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Of the payments made in the year ended December 31, 2019, A135.1 million related to significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of our product portfolio (of which A84.2 million were made in connection with the acquisition of a branded products portfolio in the United Kingdom), as compared to A255.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Within the scope of business combinations, we made net payments of A47.5 million for the Biopharma acquisition. In the year ended December 31, 2019, proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A31.5 million, as compared to A9.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies as well as from the disposal of non-current assets held for sale related to dividends of Stellapharm J.V. (formerly STADA Vietnam J.V.), which was previously accounted for using the equity method, and constituted partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell the shares held by STADA in this company as of December 31, 2019 as well as the final purchase price payment. _Cash Flow from Financing Activities_ Cash flow from financing activities increased by A98.3 million, or 100%, to a cash outflow of A196.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from a cash outflow of A98.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to significantly lower borrowings of funds compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we issued temporary notes, with a nominal volume of A600 million, in order to finance the Takeda Acquisition, which was completed in March 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the proceeds from the temporary notes were deposited into an escrow account, pending completion of the Takeda Acquisition. The relevant credit balance generated by the retention of the proceeds on the escrow account was recorded as an inflow of cash from financing activities. Repayments of financial liabilities also decreased in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, when certain creditors of STADA became entitled, in accordance with the financing conditions, to prematurely terminate certain bonds, promissory note loans and bank loans due to the Takeover Offer in 2017. Also, in the second quarter of 2018 we made a scheduled repayment of a STADA Arzneimittel AG bond in the amount of A347.1 million. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2018, we made payments of A1,447.0 million in connection with the Delisting Offer and the increase in our controlling interest in STADA. _Year Ended December 31, 2018 of STADA, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 of STADA Cash Flow from Operating Activities_ Cash flow from operating activities increased by A57.4 million, or 22%, to a cash inflow of A320.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from a cash inflow of A262.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in gross cash flow as a result of a strong annual result and lower income tax payments. In addition, there were significantly lower cash outflows in connection with inventories and slight cash inflows in connection with trade accounts receivable compared with significant cash outflows in the previous year. In addition, significantly lower use from deferrals for healthcare insurance settlements was recorded. On the other hand, there were significantly higher cash outflows from the settlement of trade accounts payable, which were high at the end of the previous year. _Cash Flow from Investing Activities_ Cash flow from investing activities increased by A177.7 million, or 145%, to a cash outflow of A300.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from a cash outflow of A122.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to payments in the amount of A280.3 million for investments in intangible assets, compared to A70.2 million in the previous year, primarily relating to the acquisition of the rights to the Nizoral for the EMEA region as well as the reacquisition of the trademark rights to Ladival. In addition, there were net inflows from the acquisition of the majority interest in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents acquired at the time of acquisition exceeded the purchase price. 97 ----- In 2018, we spent a total of A236.2 million on acquisitions as part of business combinations and significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of our product portfolio, compared to A42.3 million in the previous year. Investments in other intangible assets amounted to A24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to A30.7 million in the previous year. These comprise, in particular, insignificant individual payments for the development and acquisition of dossier submissions for active substance approvals. Payments for investments in property, plant and equipment in 2018 amounted to A48.1 million, compared to A55.0 million in the previous year. This also includes investments in production sites, manufacturing facilities and test laboratories, for which additions amounting to a total of A22.8 million were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to A36.3 million in the previous year. Payments for investments in financial assets in the year ended December 31, 2018 were A0.3 million. As a result of disposals, we recorded an inflow of payments totaling A9.2 million in cash flow from investing activities in financial year 2018, compared to A5.7 million in the previous year. Income from the disposal of consolidated companies related to dividends of STADA Vietnam measured at equity, which are partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the sale of STADA’s shares as of December 31, 2019. _Cash Flow from Financing Activities_ Cash flow from financing activities increased by A307.5 million, or 135%, to a cash inflow of A79.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from a cash outflow of A227.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in financial liabilities due to the loans granted to STADA by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. This was offset by higher repayments of financial liabilities. This resulted in particular from the creditors of STADA Arzneimittel AG becoming entitled, in accordance with the financing conditions, to prematurely terminate bonds, promissory note loans and bank loans due to the takeover in 2017. In this context, a partial amount of A360.2 million was made due prematurely in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018 we scheduled the repayment of a bond in the amount of A347.1 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A145.8 million and was primarily due to a cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in Germany, Serbia, Russia and the United Kingdom, due, among other things, to stocking up for the flu season and safety stock. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of A60.3 million, driven by a cash-effective increase in trade receivables, mainly of our subsidiaries in Italy, the United Kingdom and Belgium, primarily as a result of a strong sales performance in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, which was partly offset by a significant decrease in trade receivables of our subsidiaries in Russia. The change in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash inflow of A77.2 million and resulted primarily from our subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and Serbia, partly due to reporting date effects. 98 ----- In the year ended December 31, 2018, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of A95.9 million, compared to a cash outflow of A123.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A44.9 million and was primarily due to a cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in Russia and Serbia. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash inflow of A0.5 million, driven by a decrease in overall factoring volume, contrary there was a decrease in trade receivables, especially in our subsidiaries in Belgium, Serbia, Germany and France. The change in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash outflow of A51.5 million and resulted primarily due to the settlement of significant invoices of our German companies, especially STADA, for consultancy services, as well as from reporting date effects, especially in Serbia. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of A123.1 million. The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A64.6 million and was primarily due to additional inventories of our subsidiary ALIUD PHARMA, which were necessary to ensure compliance with health insurance tenders. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of A31.5 million, driven by decreasing factoring volumes. The change in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash outflow of A27.0 million and resulted primarily from reporting date effects, especially in Russia.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

These particularly result from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British pound sterling and Serbian dinar in relation to the euro. A currency risk consists of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other than the respective functional currency, or as a result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk). However, we believe that we can mitigate this risk to a certain extent through natural hedges and the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we used foreign exchange futures contracts and interest and currency swaps. The maturity dates of forward contracts are generally set as necessary to match our anticipated cash flows. The remaining terms of the contracts are currently up to one year. Furthermore, currency risks also exist in relation to the translation of the balance sheet items, as well as the conversion of income and expenses of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone (translation risk). In this connection, the current political conflict between Ukraine and Russia, as well as negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union over Brexit, could indirectly continue to have a negative influence on exchange rates and our results of operations. For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as of December 31, 2019 showed that in financial year 2019, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately A2.0 million. At the same time, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency in relation to the British pound sterling of 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately A24.9 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

We calculate existing interest rate risks with sensitivity analyses that show the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as on equity. Should the sensitivity analysis show that interest rate fluctuations could lead to significant impacts, we could use derivative hedging instruments to avoid the risk. A sensitivity analysis from STADA showed that an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in 2019 would have resulted in additional income of A0.3 million, compared to A7.5 million in the previous 101 ----- year, and a decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in additional income of A1.9 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2019, compared to additional expenses of A2.1 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Following the Offering and subject to the assumptions set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ our indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (which will bear a floating interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR), the Senior Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Additional Notes (each which have a fixed rate coupon).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Risks of default also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. We therefore strive to maintain business relations only with counterparties of sufficient credit quality. In addition, we partly use credit support such as guarantees, loan insurance or the transfer of assets to safeguard ourselves against default risk. Overdue receivables are continuously monitored and potential default risks are addressed through value adjustments.

Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once a year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill at STADA is allocated to cash-generating units aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to STADA’s two operating segments for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill. We carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the valuation unit, including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Following this three-year period, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions are made in order to determine the value in use, including assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the discount rate and currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data. Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for use, i.e., when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is reevaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty method. In our case the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are relating to the umbrella brands of, in the case of the STADA Financial Statements, Hemofarm, Pymepharco and Vannier, all capitalized in the context of their respective acquisitions, and, in the case of the Topco Financial Statements, Hemofarm and STADA, all capitalized in the context of the STADA Acquisition. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the acquisition cost. 103 ----- Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist. Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, we assess whether indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g., if certain defined critical values are exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for two operating divisions with specific parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are reported under the heading ‘‘Other expenses.’’ For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, our cash-generating units are defined at the level of individual assets within the reportable divisions of Branded Products and Generics of STADA. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under the heading ‘‘Other income.’’ For items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Pension obligations are measured in accordance with actuarial principles using the projected unit credit method. The pension provisions recognized in the balance sheet correspond to the present value of the defined benefit obligation on the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for any limitation of the benefit asset. In addition to earned pensions and entitlements, the calculation also includes future salary and pension increases. For our German companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. In other countries in which we operate, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate will be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market for corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on 104 ----- the basis of market yields on government bonds. Changes to the assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized with no effect on income. It differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions and financial assumptions as well as experience-based amendments. They are recognized directly in equity with no effect on income in the period in which they occur (‘‘other comprehensive income’’ or ‘‘OCI’’). The relevant amounts are reported separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the calculation of the portion of the interest income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, IAS 19 requires the application of the discount rate underlying the obligation. The remainder of the actual income from plan assets is to be recognized directly in other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss. The current service cost is recognized in staff costs of the individual functional areas. All past service costs that arise in the financial year shall be recognized immediately through profit or loss. Several of our subsidiaries also grant their employees defined contribution plans. In these cases, we pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis without incurring additional liabilities. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans are recognized as expenses in the respective period in the relevant functional areas. The other non-current provisions contain ‘‘anniversary provisions’’ and other long-term employee benefits. Commitments to anniversary payments are accounted in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 and other long-term employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not recognized without an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately reported as income or expenditure in the relevant functional areas. Furthermore, there is a working time accounts plan that is accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

An outflow of assets embodying economic benefits is considered as probable if it is more likely to occur than not. Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into account all recognizable risks, offers the best possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the obligations. Any existing reimbursement claims by third parties are not netted with other provisions. Expenses from the creation of provisions are allocated to functional costs according to where they arise. If changes in estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other provisions are reversed on a pro rata basis and recognized through profit and loss under the item where the original expense was recognized. The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. We set aside provisions in the event of a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources (meaning that an outflow is more likely to occur than not). Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on how we estimate the prospects of the success of these methods.

The tax receivables and liabilities recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and outside Germany in respect of the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as from previous years, if applicable. The tax receivables and liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the 105 ----- reporting date or known and already concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable profit is generated. Deferred tax liabilities are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities and their valuation rate in the IFRS financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will result against which the temporary difference can be utilized as well as for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences taxable in the future. We determine deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the reporting date or those that have already been resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax receivables and liabilities are offset if these relate to the same taxation authority. The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that are recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with an effect on deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise. We operate in various countries and are obligated to pay income taxes in each respective tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred tax liabilities in the Group, the expected income taxes as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain balance sheet items according to IFRS are determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on current and deferred taxes and thus on the net assets, financial position and results of our operations in the respective periods. Furthermore, we consider increasingly important the existence of a comprehensive tax transfer pricing model for the remuneration of intragroup services within the Group. Possible risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes are limited by the introduction of appropriate communication methods and an overarching definition of transfer pricing in the form of Group-wide policies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes. Derivative financial instruments exist in the context of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss as well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and hedges of net investments in a foreign operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging instruments in the context of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. We use cash flow hedges to protect against fluctuations of cash flows associated with an accounted asset or an accounted financial liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the fair value of these hedging instruments are recognized with no effect on income in the amount of the effective part of the hedging relationship directly in equity. A transfer to the income statement takes place in the period when the underlying hedged item becomes effective. The ineffective part of the changes in value is, however, recognized directly in the income statement. In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of accounted assets or accounted liabilities or fixed off-balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions are recorded in our income statement as if they were changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. If the requirements for hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously hedged items are adjusted on the basis of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign operation are treated according to the same accounting policies as cash flow hedges. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not yet made use of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss. When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments for which no market price in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called ‘‘forward rates,’’ are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

Statutory health insurance is provided by statutory healthcare funds (Krankenkassen). Through these funds, citizens have equal access to healthcare benefits from healthcare professionals who are licensed and provide healthcare services within the statutory healthcare system. For the employed, membership in the statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless their income rises above an annually determined threshold (currently A57,600 per year).

The UK NHS is financed partly by the government and partly from national insurance premiums, paid at source by employers and employees. Around 11% of the population currently has some form of private medical insurance. Reimbursements are subject to the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (‘‘PPRS’’), which is a profit framework that allows drug manufacturers a defined return on capital and profit each year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (‘‘NICE’’) was established in 1999 to review the cost efficiencies of medicines and discourage their use if their cost outweighed their benefit. NICE is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health in the United Kingdom. In April 2017, the Health Services Medical Supplies (Costs) Act (‘‘The Act’’) was given Royal assent, effective from April 2018. The Act is focused on controlling the cost of health service medicines and other medical suppliers in the United Kingdom. Prices of branded medicines for the NHS are regulated through two schemes: Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), which is voluntary, and Statutory Scheme. Branded medicine providers can choose to sign up to PPRS or if not, they will automatically fall under the control of Statutory Scheme. However, unbranded generic medicines sold by companies which had opted into the PPRS in relation to their branded medicines, fell outside the Statutory Scheme. Hence pricing of their unbranded generic medicines was not subject to the control of the Statutory Scheme and was instead driven by market competition. This had created a loophole allowing some companies to significantly increase the price of unbranded generics or in some cases de brand the branded medicine and significantly increase the price owing to lack of competition. The Act introduced a similar payment mechanism on medicines under the Statutory Scheme as that under the PPRS. As a result, the government can now control the prices of unbranded generic medicines. In addition, the Act clarifies the government’s power to require companies to make payments to control the cost of health service medicines. The Act also includes 112 ----- the power to create regulations requiring manufacturers, distributors and suppliers to the NHS to maintain records and, if requested, disclose such records to the department of health through the issuance of an information notice, thereby strengthening the basis on which the government can collect data on the sale and purchase of medicines from all parts of the supply chain.

The generic penetration in Belgium is relatively low at 40% as of 2017 (by volume). Since 2001, Belgium has a reference pricing system (‘‘RPS’’) for generics. The RPS works by imposing a fixed minimum price difference between generic and originator medicines (reference price, RP). Over time, the Belgian government has progressively reduced the reference price from 84% (until July 2002), 80% (until January 2003) to 74% of the price of the originator medicine (until July 2005). The current level stands at minimum approximately 60% of the price of the originator medicine. After its introduction in 2001, the RPS was associated with an increased market share of generic medicines. The RPS was enlarged in 2005 to include all pharmaceutical forms and dosages of the same active substance. Patient co-payments in Belgium are high compared to other European countries, and range from 0% to 80% of the medicine price depending on the type of patient and medicine. Belgian policy attempts to foster demand for generic medicines by increasing patient co-payment for specific medication classes and for branded medicines that are off patent. In 2006, quotas for prescribing low-cost medicines (generic medicines or originator medicines that have reduced their price) were assigned to physicians. The volume quotas, expressed in defined daily doses (DDD), affect reimbursable outpatient medicines dispensed by retail pharmacies, but not pharmacists’ magistral preparations. For the physicians, the minimum prescribing rate for lower priced medicines is 27% of all prescriptions expressed in DDD. Pharmanet (an information system created in 1996) data are used to check whether physicians comply with quotas. If physicians prescribe expensive medicines inappropriately, they are monitored by the Ministry of Health for at least six months and receive information and training in low-cost prescribing. A law permitting generic substitution by pharmacists conditional on getting approval from the prescribing physician and the patient was passed in 1993. However, as the royal decree necessary to put this legislation into practice has not been passed to date, generic substitution by pharmacists is not allowed. Since April 2010, pharmacist margins in Belgium are made up of two components: a fixed lump sum and an economic margin set as a percentage of the price of the medicine (4%). This system aims to make the delivery of generic medicines neutral to pharmacists from a financial perspective. The OTC market in Belgium represented sales of approximately A742 million in 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.8% between 2018 and 2022. 117 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

With more than 30,000 SKUs covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA region, Asia, South America and Australia. We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales and we ranked ninth among OTC companies in Europe as of December 31, 2019. Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective manufacturing footprint comprising 21 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building on our tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each year since 2014. Our solid pipeline of new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated sales of A2,608.6 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of A885.3 million. The products we sell are classified according to two divisions: Generics and Branded Products. Generics:_ Within our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations of originator drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics division is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 18% of sales in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling products (and their respective therapeutic areas) in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Epoetin zeta (anemia), Tilidine, Tilidine/Naloxone (pain), Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Omeprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Pantoprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Diclofenac (pain, anti-inflammatory), Paracetamol (pain), Bisoprolol (high blood-pressure), Amoxi-Clavulan (antibiotic), Fentanyl (analgesic). The largest countries by sales in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia, Russia, France and Switzerland. We generated sales of A1,534.7 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A439.3 million in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019. Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products division primarily includes branded OTC products, which are typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests, cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-go (Parkinson’s disease). The market for products in our Branded Products division is generally characterized by market-driven pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty being important factors for success. Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 37% of sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling brands (and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Bortezomib (anti-cancer medication, prescription required multiple myeloma), APO-go (Parkinson’s disease, prescription required, available in 28 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in 28 countries), Zoflora (household disinfection), Snup (rhinitis), Aqualor (rhinitis, sore throats, available in 18 countries), Nizoral (anti-dandruff shampoo), Hirudoid (anti-coagulant), Vitaprost (prostate diseases) and Versatis (local anesthetic). The largest countries by sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Italy. We generated sales of A1,073.9 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A298.0 million in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. 118 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Our Strengths,18.12.1,Organic Growth Underpinned by Attractive Market Fundamentals and Bolt-on Acquisitions,"Increasing demand for our Generics and Branded Products is driven by global growth factors in the pharmaceutical industry, including population growth, aging societies, increased incidences of chronic disease, advances in medical therapies and increasing self-medication and health awareness. According to IQVIA, the global generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2020 to 2024, driven by these growth trends and increasing generics penetration. Generics penetration in the market for prescription products is partly driven by cost containment regulation that incentivizes the use of generics to counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs. Another key driver of generics penetration is patent expirations. According to publicly available estimates, a wave of patent expirations in developed markets is expected to push originator products with sales of more than $12.2 billion in aggregate into the generics market between 2019 and the end of 2022. Given that our Branded Products division consists mostly of OTC products, growth in this division is additionally driven by factors influencing the self-payment and self-care market for health and well-being related products. We expect demand for self-payment and self-care products to benefit from the ongoing trend among regulators to transfer prescription drugs to OTC status, which decreases the cost burden on the public health system and expands market opportunity for companies such as us that offer branded OTC products. Additionally, demand for OTC products is expected to be driven by rising income levels and the emerging trend toward greater health awareness, which we believe results from ongoing research on disease prevention, data access and increasing levels of education. According to IQVIA, the global OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2020 to 2024. In addition to our organic growth, we have a strong record of growth through focused acquisitions. In 2019, we acquired from GlaxoSmithKline five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, as well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and expanded our footprint in Eastern Europe and Asia through our acquisitions of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals in the Philippines, to bolster our presence in Asia following the disposal of our Vietnamese joint venture. Furthermore, we agreed to acquire the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG, a specialist in the trade and distribution of pharmaceutical products in Switzerland, to expand our Swiss operations. Most recently, we acquired multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the Takeda Acquisition and a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe through the Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In our Generics division, based on IQVIA data for the year ended December 31, 2019, we held a top-three market share in generics sales in Germany. We were also the fourth-largest player in Italy and the fourth-largest in Spain. Moreover, in the year ended December 31, 2019, our Belgian Generics unit was the leader in the Belgian market, and we ranked second among national manufacturers in the Russian Generics market. Even though these markets are generally considered to be mature, there is significant room for increased penetration (by value) and further growth in generics in these markets. For example, according to IQVIA, generics penetration by sales value is below 30% in Belgium, 35% in Italy, 35% in Spain, and below 50% in France and 45% in Germany. The generics industry in Germany, Spain and Russia is expected to increase by a CAGR of 5.4%, 7.9% and 9.2% from 2020 to 2024, respectively. Continued growth in the generics industry in countries where we are already market leaders provides us with an opportunity to continue to grow sales in our Generics division. We also benefit from an attractive portfolio of products in our Branded Products division, including category-leading therapies for cough and cold, medical skin care sun protection, vitamin deficiencies and many leading brands across therapeutic areas in Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 75% of sales of our top 30 products in our Branded Products division were of products with a top-three market position in their respective countries. Many of these leading products have been category leaders in their respective markets for many years, providing us with an opportunity to leverage our local marketing expertise to drive the 119 ----- internationalization of these leading brands into new markets and further grow sales in our Branded Products division.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Our Strengths,18.12.3,"Competitive Advantage Through Scale, Local Market Expertise and Established Relationships","Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage over new entrants in our markets, bolstered by our scale and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies. The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement regimes and distribution channels. This provides an advantage to existing, large-scale players with a long history of local expertise, such as us. We are highly familiar with the regulatory requirements in our key markets and have developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory and distribution issues, which enables us to minimize the time and cost required to obtain regulatory product approvals while maximizing the number of countries we cover. Germany, for example, operates a public tender system that covers the majority of prescription generics sales, which necessitates a modestly sized sales team with significant tender experience. In Russia, on the other hand, the distribution of prescription generics products is mostly patient-driven after the first prescription, which significantly increases the need for a larger sales force targeting patients indirectly via doctors. Our local market experience means that we are adept at navigating these and other regimes and are able to serve each market with a tailored sales and distribution approach. Building on our long history and our origins as a pharmacy cooperative, we have developed deeply ingrained relationships with the key distribution channels in our markets, which we believe are difficult to replicate. We successfully pursue different business models tailored to local markets’ needs. Our sales forces are trained and experienced in identifying the right marketing strategy for each country, and we maintain a direct sales presence in approximately 30 countries, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors and internationalize successful brands.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Our Strengths,18.12.4,"Diversified Across Geographic Areas, Therapeutic Areas, Products and Brands","We are diversified across geographic markets, products, therapeutic areas, customers and suppliers, thereby limiting our exposure to any single product, geographic area and reimbursement system. We market our products in approximately 120 countries with largely uncorrelated end-markets. With more than 30,000 SKUs, we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and are not dependent on the success of any single product. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the top-ten products by sales in our Generics division accounted for only 18% of Generics sales, and the top-ten products in the Branded Products division accounted for only 37% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering is diversified across a large number of therapeutic areas and benefits from a high rate of new product launches, with a strong pipeline for the next four to five years. The combination of our Generics and Branded Products divisions provides us with significant benefits in terms of diversification and synergies. The pricing of prescription generics is regulated, and volume demand is relatively independent of economic conditions, such that our Generics business has historically delivered strong and stable sales and cash generation. Our Branded Products division, on the other hand, faces fewer regulatory requirements. OTC products can be brought to the market more quickly, and pricing is unregulated and driven by competition. As a result, our highly recognizable brands, customer loyalty and the lack of competition in certain specialty areas provide for attractive pricing for products in our Branded Products division. Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond relatively quickly to emerging consumer trends. Our presence in both divisions allows us to deepen our local market expertise and regulatory know-how; exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing; and maintain our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

This provides us with a relatively low-cost and highly flexible production base. 120 ----- Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and 15 of our sites are required to comply with stringent EU standards and are EU certified plants. Moreover, local production helps provide a natural hedge for currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products in certain countries.

Having held various senior management positions in Europe, Asia and the United States for the Novartis Group, Mr. Goldschmidt also served as the President of Sandoz USA and the Head of North America at Sandoz, where he rapidly expanded the company’s generics and biosimilar business, generating revenues of over $3 billion. He was also the global executive member for Central and Eastern Europe for Sandoz, leading Sandoz to a top ranking market position in generics and rapidly growing its OTC business. On February 1, 2020, Wolfgang Ollig joined our senior management team as our new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ollig has more than 15 years of experience as group chief financial officer in various industries, including medical, automotive and biotech. Most recently, Mr. Ollig served as chief financial officer of WSA A.S, a Danish company under private equity ownership that is the global leader in hearing aid manufacturing, with more than 10,000 employees and headquarters in Copenhagen and Singapore. Mr. Ollig has significant experience in capital markets transactions, having led automotive supplier Hella as chief financial officer in its 2014 initial public offering. Our leadership team also includes Miguel Pagan Fernandez who was appointed Chief Technological Officer of STADA on July 1, 2018, having previously served as the Head of Global Technical Operations (Solids and Special Technologies) of Novartis. In addition to our senior executive team, our business benefits from experienced and dedicated operational teams with a deep understanding of the healthcare and generics markets.

Since the STADA Acquisition in August 2017, we also draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive and successful track record of investing in companies in the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital increased sales by 49% within two years and significantly increased the workforce at Bio Products Laboratory, creating a life sciences champion in the United Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large laboratory diagnostics companies, Synlab (Germany) and Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form Synlab Group (headquartered in Germany), the European champion in laboratory diagnostics. In addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury Pharma and Amdipharm, and merged the two businesses to create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented generics market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy centered on continued buy and build, further internationalization and applying best practice across both companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to TSX/Nasdaq listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion in 2015. Most recently, Cinven has acquired LGC, a global leader in the life sciences sector. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving cost savings and improvements in margins, while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both 121 ----- organically and through targeted acquisitions. Our recent revenue and profitability growth was driven by the Transformation Program that the Sponsors are implementing at STADA, which contributed to the significant increase in our EBITDA margin from 19% in the year ended December 31, 2018, to 22% in the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Over the course of our over 120-year history we have 123 ----- leveraged our sustainable approach to business and a strategy geared for the long-term to expand from a small pharmaceutical undertaking focused on its domestic German market, into a leading player in the international healthcare and pharmaceutical markets: - In 1957, we transferred our headquarters to its current location in Bad Vilbel. - Shortly thereafter, in 1961, we started shifting our manufacturing activities from local production by our member pharmacies to centralized production facilities in Bad Vilbel. - At the beginning of 1970, we converted our corporate form from a cooperative into a corporation to facilitate capital formation for our future expansion. - In 1975, we expanded our product portfolio by venturing into the nascent generics market. - In 1986, we leveraged our access to capital and began our expansion into international markets, first through the purchase of subsidiaries in our neighboring countries, Switzerland and Austria, and later through acquisitions in Asia, including Hong Kong in 1992. - In 1996, we acquired ALIUD PHARMA GmbH in Germany, which allowed us to expand our generics portfolio to a second, separate product line. In 1997, we branched out further into the Czech Republic and France. - In October 1997, we consummated our initial public offering (‘‘IPO’’) and listed our shares for official trading on the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and D¨usseldorf. Within five years of our IPO, our shares were included in the renowned MDAX segment of the Deutsche Boerse Group. Today, our shares are listed on Xetra and the stock exchanges of Frankfurt, Berlin, D¨usseldorf, Hamburg, Hannover, Munich and Stuttgart. - By 2005, we had accelerated our international expansion and acquired companies in Thailand, Ireland, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Russia, Portugal and Serbia. In addition, we purchased several portfolios of Branded Products, as well as the rights to individual Branded Products. - In 2006, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of A1 billion. - In 2008, the introduction of SILAPO, a pharmaceutical product used to treat anemia resulting from chronic kidney failure and chemotherapy, marked our first commercialization of a biosimilar. In the following years, we began in-licensing biosimilars from highly specialized suppliers, in order to develop our biosimilars portfolio in a cost-effective way. - In 2013, we moved into the field of individualized drug therapy with the introduction of multiple DNA tests, and thereby developed our diagnostic portfolio. Over the course of the year the offering was expanded into a diverse range of self-tests. Furthermore, with the acquisition of the British OTC supplier Thornton & Ross, we took another step in developing our increasingly important Branded Products portfolio. - In 2014, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of A2 billion. - In 2017, the Sponsors, Bain and Cinven Funds, acquired a controlling interest in STADA with the aim of consolidating its market-leading positions, further expanding its business and increasing profitability. - In 2018 and 2020, the Sponsors further increased their controlling interest through the Delisting Offer and several negotiated transactions, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Generics are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of reference branded originator drugs and can be introduced into the market once the patents on the originator drugs have expired. Despite their high quality, generics are substantially less expensive than the originator products because the original research costs and clinical trials do not have to be repeated. In our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics mostly comprising prescription products, thereby offering a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more-expensive originator products. In most countries, 124 ----- the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly or indirectly through reimbursement rates payable by the health insurance system. Unbranded generics are typically labeled with the name of their manufacturer and marketed under the chemical name of their active pharmaceutical ingredient. The chemical name is also referred to as the generic name or International Non-Proprietary Name (‘‘INN’’). Examples of unbranded generics that we market under their chemical name include Tilidine Naloxone (pain) and Atorvastatin (elevated cholesterol level). Our range of Branded Products is diverse. It mainly includes branded generics that can be sold over-the-counter, which are also referred to as branded OTC or nonprescription products. OTC products can be purchased without the supervision of a healthcare professional such as a physician, and without a prescription. These drugs are tried and tested products that have been on the market for many years and are not typically protected by patents but rely on brands to differentiate the products. Examples include sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, and pain relievers. Additionally, our Branded Products portfolio features non-generic pharmaceutical products such as DNA tests, cosmetics, glucose meters and vaping products. Lastly, our range of Branded Products comprises a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands include Ladival (OTC), Grippostad (OTC), Covonia (OTC) and APO-go (prescription only). Prices of Branded Products are much more flexible than those of Generics and can be set on the basis of the competitive advantage a product has over its competitors. _Categorization_ Whether products are categorized into the Generics or Branded Products division depends on our marketing strategy. The marketing of prescription generics is generally price-driven, and where we decide to compete mainly on that basis and market generics under their chemical name, we classify them into the Generics division. In some cases, we assign generics to the Branded Products division because we are able to compete on the basis of product quality, brand awareness and brand loyalty among customers, such that we are able to charge premium prices. In most countries, our portfolio of Branded Products predominantly comprises OTC products such as Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad (for coughs and colds) and Aqualor (for sinus infections and sore throats). In the United Kingdom our range of Branded Products also includes major prescription products such as APO-go (for Parkinson’s disease). Our OTC products and medical devices are globally assigned to the Branded Products division. _Delivery Forms and Packaging_ Our product portfolio comprises a broad range of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, suppositories, dry powder for reconstitution as suspensions and liquids. We offer a large spectrum of packaging sizes and various delivery forms, utilizing either immediate or sustained release delivery. We generally do not market injectables. _Diversification Across Therapeutic Areas_ Our pharmaceutical product offering is well diversified across therapeutic areas and focuses on the following categories: allergies and hay fever; diagnostics; diabetes; coughs and colds; fitness and vitality; sore throats; skin diseases; cardiovascular diseases; gastrointestinal conditions; muscle and joint conditions; histamine intolerance; lactose intolerance; stress relief and sleep disorders; menstrual dysfunction and the menopause; pain and fever relief; pregnancy and lactation; medical skincare sun protection; and metabolic conditions. _Diversification Across Products_ With more than 30,000 SKUs on offer, we carry a highly diversified product portfolio. The breadth of our portfolio also ensures that we are not dependent on the success of any single product, with no single product accounting for more than 3% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the top-ten products by sales in our Generics division accounted for only 18% of Generics sales, and the top-ten products in the Branded Products division accounted for only 37% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering also benefits from a healthy rate of replenishment. We have released on average 600 new products (primarily in our Generics division) per year since 2014, with a strong pipeline for the next four to five years. See ‘‘—Research and Product Development.’’ 125 ----- _Diversification Across Geographic Regions_ Our SKUs are marketed in approximately 120 largely uncorrelated markets in Europe, the MENA region, Asia, Australia and the Americas, which provides us with a high degree of diversification across geographic regions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Generics accounted for A1,534.7 million, or 59%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. _Top-Ten Generics_ Our portfolio of Generics includes numerous market leaders in mature product categories. The table below shows our top-ten Generics products by sales in the year ended December 31, 2019, including their respective market share and market position in selected markets in major geographic regions for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Branded Products accounted for A1,073.9 million, or 41%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. _Pain Relief_ One of the chief categories in our product portfolio is pain relief, and we carry products targeting general pain, migraines, fever-induced pain, toothache, muscle pain, menstrual pain and others. We sell many delivery forms including tablets, syrups, suspensions and suppositories. Some of our best-known brands include Mobilat, Ibudolor, Neuranidal and Pfeil. _Cough and Cold Medicines_ Our product range comprises a wide variety of cough and cold medicines, which can be administered as effervescent tablets, syrups, sprays, gels and capsules. Our key brands in the category include Grippostad, which ranks first in Germany; Covonia, which is one of the most recognizable brand names in the United Kingdom; and Aqualor, with respect to Russia. _Sunscreens_ We sell sunscreen products in various delivery forms, including creams, sprays, lip balms and sticks. Our key brand in the medical skincare sun protection space is Ladival, which is the first-in-class product in Germany in terms of brand recognition among pharmacists. We developed Ladival over 30 years ago and in 2013 we transferred the European trademark rights to a third-party; we have since repurchased those rights. Many of our competitors’ sunscreen products contain synthetic compounds derived from petroleum and natural gas (petrochemicals) which are absorbed by the skin. Our sunscreen offering is differentiated in that it is derived from largely natural sources and is free from artificial fragrances, coloring, petrochemicals and parabens which are known to cause allergies in some cases. In compliance with this positioning, we distribute our Ladival products exclusively through pharmacies. _Cosmetics_ Under the Claire Fisher brand, which we acquired in 2014, we market age-control products, moisturizers, exfoliators, creams, tonics, lotions, shower gels and liquid soaps. As in the case of our sunscreen products, we mainly target health-conscious consumers who are drawn to mostly natural ingredients. Accordingly, we developed our portfolio in close collaboration with dermatologists and other experts and took great care in ensuring that all our cosmetics products are free from animal-derived ingredients, nanotechnology, genetically modified plants, artificial colors, petrochemicals and parabens. _Rhinitis Medicine_ Rhinitis medicine alleviates the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (commonly known as hay fever). Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen such as pollen, dust, mold or flakes of skin from certain animals. Our most recognizable brands include Aqualor, Snup, Cetirizin and Loratadin. _Probiotics and Dietary Supplements_ Our portfolio of Branded Products also includes probiotics and dietary supplements aimed at the self-improvement market. Examples include vitamin supplements, lactose digestants, magnesium supplements and immune system boosters. 128 ----- _Diagnostics_ In our diagnostics business, we market high-quality tests and testing devices both to healthcare professionals and consumers. We believe this responds to an emerging trend, as consumers are becoming increasingly health conscious and concerned with disease prevention. Our self-tests can be applied at home and provide consumers with a quick and simple way to determine whether symptoms they experience may be a first indication of a new or recurring illness. Our portfolio includes tests to detect colorectal cancer, iron deficiency, gluten intolerance, bacterial infections and the menopause. Tests offered for professional use include DNA tests to determine the efficacy of breast cancer therapies and the side effects of anti-cholesterol therapies, as well as to tailor therapies for myocardial and stroke prophylaxis and antidepressants to the individual requirements of each patient. In addition, we sell Ebola tests which provide a quick and reliable check for this disease. We also offer glucose meters and various accessories to enable diabetic patients to monitor and treat their illness both at home and on the move. _Branded Prescription Generics_ In certain cases, we assign prescription generics to the Branded Products business. This occurs mostly where we can charge premium prices based on product quality, brand awareness and brand loyalty and where there is a general lack of competition. One example is APO-go, which is a category leader in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in the United Kingdom. _Top-Ten Branded Products_ Our broad and well diversified portfolio of Branded Products includes numerous mature-category leaders in local markets, many of which have not yet been internationalized. We believe this provides us with further potential to grow our sales organically. Approximately 75% of the sales generated by our top 30 Branded Products in 2019 were due to products ranking as one of the top-three in their respective countries. Set forth below are our top-ten Branded Products by sales in the year ended December 31, 2019, including their respective market share and market position in selected markets for the year ended December 31, 2019 (except as otherwise indicated), on the basis of IQVIA and management data:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

We were the fifth-largest generics company in Europe as of December 31, 2019, and the resulting scale advantage, together with our efficient manufacturing footprint across lower-cost countries, our extensive local market expertise that we have acquired since our inception in 1895 and our deeply ingrained relationships with suppliers that we have established over our long history all contribute to this leading position in the Generics market. As a one-stop shop, we are also committed to providing a full portfolio in most of our markets. This gives us a competitive advantage, as customers often request a multitude of different dosage forms and strengths when placing orders for Generics, which we can reliably supply, whereas many of our competitors do not have this capability and thus cannot fulfill these orders. The breadth of our portfolio also helps us to achieve economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing. _In-licensed Products_ With respect to certain patented originator products and biosimilars we have entered into license agreements with highly specialized, high profile suppliers under which distribution rights are licensed to us on attractive commercial terms. Due to our local market expertise, established distribution channels and geographic reach into approximately 120 countries, we are an in-licensing partner of choice. In 2015, for the first time ever, the number of newly expired patents on biologics in Germany exceeded newly expired patents on chemical synthetic products, which contributed to the significant increase in the global generics market from 2014 to 2015. We believe that this is evidence of a trend toward the increasing importance of biosimilars in the future global generics market, which is partly due to the fact that biosimilars can be produced at significantly lower-cost than the original biologics. This means that these products can substantially reduce the cost pressure faced by the global national healthcare markets and insurance carriers. As a result, we are committed to the future growth of biosimilars and believe that in-licensing constitutes a relatively low risk and cost-effective step towards developing our own biosimilars portfolio. We currently market two biosimilars: SILAPO, an epoetin biosimilar; and Movymia, a teriparatide biosimilar. In addition, we have in-licensed three other biosimilars, including adalimumab (a biosimilar to Humira), pegfilgrastim and bevacicumab. Furthermore, we have entered into an agreement with Xbrane, a Swedish biosimilar company, for the co-development of ranibizumab and are exploring options to license ranibizumab for distribution in North America. In addition, we have entered into a strategic partnership with Alvotech, a biopharmaceutical company, giving us exclusive commercialization rights to seven biosimilars in all major European markets and selected non-European markets, and we recently succeeded in extending the scope of our exclusivity rights, which we believe further enhances our business opportunity. We intend to continue to grow our Generics portfolio through in-licensing and co-development strategies aimed at the expansion of our biosimilars offering. 127 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Our acquisition of Thornton & Ross in the United Kingdom, for example, provided us with a leading platform to sell our Branded Products in this market. We intend to continue to focus our growth efforts on Branded Products, as they face significantly fewer regulatory requirements than Generics. To a lesser extent, the shift was driven by the reclassification of certain Generics into Branded Products. We believe the combination of Generics and Branded Products provides significant benefits in terms of synergies. Our presence in both divisions allows us to deepen our local market expertise and regulatory know-how, achieve economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing, and intensify our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As a result, we analyze each geographic market and only include those products in our portfolio which we believe are in low supply despite strong demand. Using our judgment, we focus only on 129 ----- the most recognizable brands, which are well known to our end-customers and ideally the local market leaders, and have growth opportunities largely independent of local market trends solely on the basis of promotional and sales support.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.19,Our Customers,18.19.1,,"We sell our products to a diverse customer base that includes consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, mail order companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as well as public or private health insurance organizations. The importance of these customer groups varies by country. Germany has a well-established tender scheme in place, such that the key purchase decision is made by the public health insurance system. In our Belgian business, which mostly focuses on Generics, the most important customer group is the doctors writing prescriptions. In Italy and Spain, pharmacies have significant discretion to decide which medication is dispensed, such that they are considered the key decision-makers. In Russia, where our product portfolio is heavily weighted toward Branded Products, our key customers are consumers in the self-payment market. Germany’s public tendering system covers the majority of generics sales, in which we have operated successfully. In Italy, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions such as hospitals. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest customer accounted for A338.4 million, or 13%, of our sales.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,"Procurement, Production and Quality Management",18.21.1,Highest Quality and Safety Standards,"Our global control management is located centrally through our top operating company, STADA Arzneimittel AG. As an international healthcare company, we have established high standards for the quality of our raw materials, products, services and working conditions. The quality standards we adhere to, both in our own manufacturing sites and those of external suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in full compliance or even exceed applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our compliance with both the statutory requirements and our internal standards is reviewed comprehensively each year as part of regular audits by our global quality management teams. In addition, the competent national authorities of each country where we operate carry out inspections on a recurring basis. Within the European Union, such inspections typically take place every two or three years. Outside the European Union, we often go beyond national requirements and inspections and additionally apply for EU Good Manufacturing Practice compliance inspections (also known as EU GMP compliance inspections). In the course of these inspections, the responsible authorities audit the compliance of our relevant non-EU production facilities with the relevant EU GMPs. Each positive inspection report results in a three-year extension of our existing EU import licenses for products manufactured in these facilities. As a result, 8 of our 11 non-EU production facilities are approved for the production and export of certain pharmaceutical dosage forms into EU countries (Banja Luka, Nizhny Novgorod, Obninsk, Podgorica, Sabac, Tuy H`oa and Vrsac). In addition to our compliance with the applicable legal requirements, we hold international certifications in accordance with external quality management systems. Accordingly, at numerous production sites, we 131 ----- focus not only on GMP standards but also on the relevant requirements of the International Organization for Standardization.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,"Procurement, Production and Quality Management",18.21.2,,"We maintain three supply chain hubs at our locations in Bad Vilbel (Germany), Vrsac (Serbia) and Moscow (Russia), which carry out the centralized procurement planning for our most important products. In each hub we have a specialized supply chain management team, as well as the appropriate infrastructure. We generally have significant flexibility in our supply chain management and plan our pharmaceuticals production with a view to continuous cost improvement. As a result of our large product portfolio, which includes approximately 800 active pharmaceutical ingredients and more than 30,000 SKUs to accommodate various dosage forms and package sizes, we rely on a large, international network of internal and external resources for our supply chain and pharmaceuticals production. 130 ----- As a result, we have been able to outsource the production of raw and auxiliary materials involved in the production of our pharmaceuticals to offshore suppliers based in Asia and other markets, which we believe deliver good quality at competitive prices. In order to efficiently manage our procurement of raw materials from these suppliers, we maintain specialized procurement offices in Shanghai (China) and Mumbai (India). As a manufacturer, we are subject to fluctuations in the market prices of our raw and auxiliary materials. Additionally, our costs depend significantly on the prices we are able to negotiate with our contract manufacturers. Under our manufacturing contracts, suppliers typically bear a portion of the loss if our gross margin decreases as a result of lower sales prices. The pass-through mechanism that we typically rely on is a price escalation clause which links the procurement prices we pay to our selling prices. In other cases, we rely on renegotiations or agree specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes, such as volumes that are put out to tender by public health insurance organizations in the context of discount agreements (Rabattvertr¨age). Discount agreements are entered into between pharmaceutical companies, such as us, and insurance carriers, such as national social insurance schemes. In a discount agreement the pharmaceutical company agrees to supply certain pharmaceuticals to the insurance carrier or its customers at a significant discount in exchange for exclusivity in the relevant product category. Discount agreements typically have a term of one or two years. In recent years, we have gradually increased the share of in-house production, shifting production volumes from our contract manufacturers to our own production facilities. Furthermore, in 2019, we manufactured 71% of our production volume in lower-cost countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and highly flexible production base. The expansion of cost-effective in-house production, coupled with the flexible make-or-buy approach described below, has helped us realize both structural cost advantages and higher capacity utilization, which resulted in lower unit prices. We take a flexible approach to our make-or-buy decisions. This means that we regularly compare our in-house production costs to offers we receive from third-party manufacturers and are prepared to outsource production where this would result in sustainable cost savings. In the past, our decision to gradually insource production capacity has helped us realize higher capacity utilization. Additionally, the fact that a large proportion of our manufacturing facilities is located in lower-cost countries has provided us with structural cost advantages compared to some of our competitors. Together, these factors have contributed significantly to the decrease in unit costs that we have realized in recent years. Each year we invest in our production facilities and test laboratories in an effort to ensure they comply with the applicable regulations and technical norms. In 2019, our investments in the expansion and modernization of our production sites and facilities, as well as test laboratories, amounted to A61.2 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Moreover, local production provides a natural hedge for currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products in certain countries.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.33,Sales and Marketing,18.33.1,,"The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement regimes, and distribution channels. This provides a competitive advantage to existing players with scale and local expertise, such as us. Building on our extensive local market expertise, we have decided to put in place decentralized marketing teams, and the size and organization of our sales force is tailored to the local environment in each market. In Germany, for example, we do not have a dedicated sales force, as the majority of our business is won through tenders. As a result, our German marketing team is distinguished mostly by its sophisticated tender management. In Belgium, our sales force targets primarily doctors who are the key decision-makers in the market, whereas our sales teams in Italy and Spain place their emphasis on pharmacies. In Russia, we market directly to consumers in the self-payment market. As part of our centralized supervision, our marketing teams research each market extensively and carefully select the products we decide to offer as part of our country portfolio, as well as their positioning. Our marketing campaigns in the United Kingdom, for instance, emphasize the filters contained in our Ladival sunscreen products, whereas the marketing of Ladival in Spain focuses on the cosmetic benefits of its ingredients. We believe the combination of centralized supervision and physical proximity to our customers provides us with a powerful sales and marketing structure. 132 ----- We have a direct sales presence in approximately 30 countries where we sell our products through our own marketing teams, subsidiaries and branches, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors. This includes all major European markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. In addition, we maintain a direct sales presence in growth markets in the MENA region (in the United Arab Emirates), Asia (including Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines), South America (Argentina) and Australia. Our decision to establish a direct sales presence is also driven by our local market expertise and is a function of the product portfolio we are offering in a given market. In geographic regions where we do not have a direct presence or where our sales presence does not cover our full product portfolio, we partner with recognized local companies. In China and Vietnam, for example, we also market and distribute certain of our products through distribution agreements with local partners. Including exports, our products were marketed and sold in approximately 120 countries in the year ended December 31, 2019. Selective acquisitions are part of our strategy and are also used to expand our existing sales network through vertical integration. For example, in 2016 and 2017, respectively, we acquired the British company Natures Aid Limited to strengthen our presence in branded products in the British market, and the Serbian pharmaceutical wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o. Beograd to strengthen our business activities in the Serbian market. In addition to growth opportunities, we seek to identify products and markets that are subject to particularly cumbersome regulatory requirements and to restructure our product portfolio to further reduce our dependency on state regulated and therefore price regulated healthcare systems.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,European Union,58.1.2,European Union Pharmaceutical Regulatory Regime,"_Non-clinical and Clinical Investigations_ Both non-clinical and clinical data (i.e., from studies involving human participants) are generally required to support a marketing authorization for a medicinal product. Appropriate studies are therefore required, the conduct of which in the EEA is carefully regulated under EU Directives 2010/63/EU, 2004/9/EC, 2004/10/EC and 2001/20/EC, respectively, and corresponding member state national laws. To the extent that non-clinical research is conducted on animals, it is subject to significant legislative restrictions. In particular, the person conducting such research and the research project itself must be authorized by a relevant competent authority. The establishment where the animal research takes place must also be compliant with the legislation—this entails an additional authorization under national legislation. As regards the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, many of the legal obligations in directive 2001/20/EC and its associated good clinical practice Directive 2005/28/EC fall on the ‘‘sponsor’’ of the clinical trial, which is defined as the individual, company, institution or organization that takes responsibility for the initiation, management and/or financing of a clinical trial. Before commencement of a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain authorization from the competent authority/ies in the member state(s) in which the trial will be conducted. Approval from a competent national ethics committee in each of the relevant member states is also a prerequisite to commencing a trial. The European Union clinical trial legislation also imposes requirements regarding the conduct of directive trial itself (which must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (‘‘GCP’’) to generate data acceptable for marketing authorization submission) and safety reporting of adverse events and reactions, among other matters. If clinical trials are conducted outside the EEA, they must likewise follow the principles set forth in European Union legislation if their results are to be submitted in an application for marketing authorization in the European Union in order for the data they generate to be accepted. These requirements also apply to bioavailability studies conducted to demonstrate acceptable bioequivalence of generic medicinal products to innovative products. The regulation of clinical trials conducted in the EEA will undergo significant change when the European Union Clinical Trials Regulation comes into effect, which the EMA expects to occur during 2020. _Marketing Authorizations_ The European Union regulatory framework applicable to medicinal products is largely set forth in the ‘‘Community’’ code contained in Directive 2001/83/EC as implemented in the respective national laws of EEA member states. Subject to certain narrow exemptions, this requires that all medicinal products, including generic versions of authorized (including previously authorized) products, must obtain a marketing authorization before they can be lawfully placed on the market in the EEA. There are three main procedures for applying for marketing authorization: the Centralized Procedure (operated by the EMA and the European Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) under EC Regulation 726/2004), the Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure, both operated by EEA member state national authorities under the rules set forth in Directive 2001/83/EC. It is also possible to obtain a purely national, stand-alone authorization for products intended for marketing only in a single EEA member state. Under the Centralized Procedure, applications must be made to the EMA for an authorization granted in the form of a single binding Commission decision to grant a Community (as defined in the relevant directive) marketing authorization which is simultaneously valid in each of the EEA member states. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for biotechnology products. It is also mandatory for advanced-therapy medicinal products for new active substances to treat cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, and for products designated as orphan medicinal products. It is also available, on an optional-basis, for other new chemical entities or innovative medicinal products, or in the interests of public health, which may also include applications for Community marketing authorizations for non-prescription and generic medicinal products of nationally authorized reference products. For generic marketing authorization applications of Community-authorized reference medicinal products (which have been authorized under the Centralized Procedure), there is automatic access to the Centralized Procedure. 138 ----- The Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure each aims to facilitate access to the EEA single market by relying upon the principle of mutual recognition. Thus, a marketing authorization or the assessment in one EEA member state (the reference EEA member state) ought in principle to be recognized by the competent authorities of the other EEA member states (the concerned EEA member states (‘‘CMSs’’), unless there are grounds for supposing that the authorization of the medicinal product concerned may present a serious risk to public health. Under both procedures, if the application is successful, the CMSs grant a national marketing authorization for the medicinal product. Under all marketing authorization procedures the applicant must submit a dossier containing, among other items, data demonstrating the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product. For generic medicinal products, there are reduced data submission requirements (no preclinical or clinical study results are required although bioequivalence must be substantiated, usually via appropriate bioavailability studies). For similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) some preclinical and/or clinical studies performed for the original reference product may not need to be reproduced as a biosimilar application is based on a comparison between the biosimilar and its reference medicine to show that there are no significant differences between them. At the time of the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product, the competent authority must specify the classification of the product as either prescription only or not. National laws may make provision for certain sub-categories. It is open to the marketing authorization holder to subsequently apply for an amendment of this classification (either way) subject to filing relevant supporting additional data. _Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing_ The European Union Community Code in directive 2001/83/EC contains substantial requirements for the manufacturing of medicinal products, which are required to be manufactured in accordance with the principles of GMP set forth in Commission directive 2003/94/EC. Manufacturing activity includes the importing of or the total or partial manufacture (including the various processes of dividing up, packaging and presenting) of medicinal products. There are also prescriptive requirements relating to the content and design of the packaging and labeling of medicinal products. These include certain mandatory information which must be stated on the product label, packaging and patient information leaflet. The manufacturer must ensure that all manufacturing operations for medicinal products subject to a marketing authorization are carried out in accordance with the information provided in the application for marketing authorization as accepted by the competent authorities. Any manufacturing operation or linked operation, that is carried out under contract for the manufacturer, must be the subject of a written contract between the manufacturer and the subcontractor which defines and allocates the responsibilities of each party and which defines, in particular, the observances of GMP to be followed by each party. The manufacturer must monitor and review the subcontractor’s performance. If manufacturing activity is undertaken within the EEA, a valid manufacturing authorization from the relevant member state is required for the category of products concerned and which covers the type of manufacturing activity undertaken (e.g., importing or packaging, etc.). The holder of a manufacturing authorization is obligated to comply with the principles and guidelines of GMP for medicinal products and to use as starting materials only active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been manufactured in accordance with the GMP for active substances. Excipients for use in medicinal products must also be produced in accordance with appropriate GMP to be determined following a formal risk assessment. As a matter of GMP compliance, the manufacturer must verify via site audits that suppliers and distributors of active substances are each complying with GMP and good distribution practice principles. Manufacturers are subject to regular inspections by competent authorities to assess their compliance with GMP. Manufacturers must also appoint a ‘‘qualified person’’ who is responsible for certifying that individual batches of medicinal product satisfy legal requirements. Manufacturing authorizations must be issued by the member state authority where the manufacturing activity and plant is located and are holder-and site-specific. European Union member state competent authorities also undertake regular GMP inspections of manufacturers located in countries outside the EEA that are engaged in the manufacture of medicinal products to be supplied to the European Union. A European Union-based manufacturer may only import active substances from outside the EEA if the active substances have been manufactured in accordance with GMPs equivalent to European Union GMPs for active substances, and if they are accompanied by a written confirmation from the competent authority of the exporting third country, which as regards the plant manufacturing the exported active substance, confirms that the standards of GMP and control of the plant are equivalent to those in the EEA. 139 ----- Alternatively, active substances may be imported from countries on the approved list of recognized GMP-equivalent countries operated by the Commission. Since 2019, the European Union falsified medicines legislation (now incorporated in Directive 2001/83/EC and in delegated directives) has imposed additional obligations on manufacturers regarding certain safety and anti-tamper features to be included in product packaging (where required). _Distribution_ Entities undertaking the wholesale distribution of medicinal products are also required to hold a wholesale dealer’s authorization from the EEA member state where the distribution is taking place and must fulfill certain requirements concerning the suitability and adequacy of premises, installations and equipment, so as to ensure the proper conservation and distribution of the medicinal products. These requirements also extend to staff. In particular, a distributor must have a qualified ‘‘responsible person’’ who meets national legislative requirements regarding qualifications. Wholesale distribution includes all activities relating to procuring, holding, supplying or exporting medicinal products, other than supplying medicinal products to the public. Such activities are carried out by manufacturers or their depositories, importers or other wholesale distributors or by pharmacists and persons authorized or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public in the member state concerned. Distributors are subject to regular site and system inspections by competent authorities to assess the distributor’s compliance with applicable legal requirements in the Community Code in directive 2001/83/EC, which include compliance with the principles of European Union GDP. Distributors must keep certain records and documentation (particularly for the purposes of facilitating product and batch recall) and must operate a quality system and have a plan for the effective implementation of recalls. Distributors are also obligated to confirm that entities from whom they obtain supplies of medicinal products have the appropriate authorizations and, where applicable, have complied with GDP principles. They may also only supply entities who possess appropriate authorizations. Since 2019, the European Union’s falsified medicines legislation has imposed additional obligations on distributors regarding the verification of specified safety and anti-tamper features to be included in product packaging (where required). _Pharmacovigilance_ ‘‘Pharmacovigilance’’ refers to the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem. Marketing authorization holders are subject to detailed and extensive risk management and pharmacovigilance obligations under Directive 2001/83/EC and EC Regulation 726/2004 and the associated guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices. Among other matters, these include the implementation of risk minimization measures on a per-product basis as well as a requirement for the marketing authorization holder to operate a pharmacovigilance system to monitor the safety of authorized medicinal products and to detect any change to their risk benefit balance. Details of the pharmacovigilance system must be set forth in the pharmacovigilance system master file, which must be maintained by the marketing authorization holder and kept available for inspection by competent authorities upon request. The marketing authorization holder must establish and use a ‘‘quality system’’ to perform its pharmacovigilance obligations. The pharmacovigilance obligations of the marketing authorization holder include detailed obligations regarding reporting. For example, a marketing authorization holder must record all suspected adverse reactions in the EEA or in countries outside the EEA that are brought to its attention, and report such information via the centralized Eudravigilance database. The marketing authorization holder must also submit periodic safety updates to the EMA regarding the benefits and risks of the medicinal product. Other pharmacovigilance obligations are imposed regarding the availability to the marketing authorization holder of appropriate personnel and resources. For example, the marketing authorization holder must have permanently and continuously at its disposal an appropriately ‘‘qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance’’ who resides in the EEA. 140 ----- _Promotion_ Directive 2001/83/EC sets out strict rules for the advertising of medicinal products. The concept of advertising is broadly defined and includes any form of door-to-door information, canvassing activity or inducement designed to promote the prescription, supply, sale or consumption of medicinal products. Advertising must not be misleading and there is a positive obligation for the advertising to encourage the rational use of a medicinal product, among other matters. All promotional materials and activities must also comply with the official ‘‘Summary of Product Characteristics’’ which is always issued for an authorized medicinal product by the authorizing competent authority. The advertising of medicines in the European Union is permitted subject to certain restrictions in Directive 2001/83/EC as implemented into EU Member State laws. For example, the advertising of unauthorized medicines is prohibited. This includes the advertising of a medicine before a marketing authorization has been granted, as well as the advertising of an authorized medicine for uses (i.e., therapeutic indications) outside the scope of its marketing authorization (so-called ‘‘off label’’ uses). Advertising of prescription-only medicines to the general public is also prohibited, as is the provision of samples to the public for promotional purposes. In addition, European Union legislation gives EEA member states a certain degree of flexibility to ensure the adequate and effective monitoring of advertising, and detailed rules regarding promotion and monitoring are consequently not fully harmonized across the EEA. _Sanctions for Infringement Under European Union Law_ Under Commission Regulation 658/2007, the Commission may directly impose financial penalties where the holder of a Community marketing authorization has intentionally or negligently breached certain obligations set forth in European Union pharmaceutical legislation. The power to impose financial penalties applies in cases where the infringement may have significant public health implications in the EEA; where it has a EEA dimension by taking place or having its effects in more than one member state; or where interests of the EEA are involved. In the event of an infringement, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 5% of the marketing authorization holder’s turnover in the EEA in the preceding year. If the infringement is ongoing, the Commission may impose penalty payments per day of up to 2.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until such time as the infringement is terminated. The Commission may also impose a fine of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s EEA turnover in the preceding business year if the marketing authorization holder fails to cooperate with the Commission’s investigation of the potential breach. If the noncooperation continues, the Commission may impose penalty payments per day of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until the noncooperation is terminated. EU Regulation 2017/2394/EU on consumer protection cooperation between enforcement authorities came into force on January 17, 2020. This regulation aims at boosting cross-border public enforcement of European Union consumer protection rules, which includes Directive 2001/83/EC, the Community Code on medicinal products. There are current Commission proposals to amend this regulation to strengthen the penalties for breaches of European Union consumer law by introducing fines based upon percentages of the infringer’s turnover. _Enforcement Under National Law_ Enforcement of the regulatory requirements outlined above takes place at a national level and is underpinned by national member state law. _Enforcement Under United Kingdom Law_ European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is generally enforced in the United Kingdom under criminal law via offenses set forth in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and the Medicines Act 1968. A person guilty of an offense is generally liable to up to two years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Liability can arise for a corporate offender and for individual officers of the company (or any person purporting to act in such capacity). Members of the company may also be liable if the affairs of the company are managed by its members. The United Kingdom competent authority has a range of enforcement powers. As well as prosecuting the company and/or individual responsible, the competent authority has investigatory powers enabling it to 141 ----- enter, inspect and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authority can also suspend or revoke any United Kingdom marketing authorization, manufacturing authorization or wholesale dealer authorization, thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities. _Enforcement Under German Law_ European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is implemented and indirectly enforced in Germany mainly via the Medicinal Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz) and various ordinances passed thereunder. General laws also applicable to the business behavior of pharmaceutical companies are the Administrative Offences Act (Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz), the Health Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz)—as far as promotional measures are concerned—and the Criminal Code with its anti-fraud and anti-kickback provisions. A person guilty of an offense can be liable to a fine or imprisonment under administrative or criminal law, depending on the nature of the violation. For example, any person who acts negligently or who willfully or negligently fails to operate a pharmacovigilance system or fails to fulfill certain general pharmacovigilance obligations shall be deemed to have committed an administrative offense. Committing an administrative offense may result in a fine not exceeding A25,000. A violation of the Health Advertising Act can lead to an administrative offense; however, in practice, these aspects (such as requests for preliminary injunctions initiated by a competitor or competition associations) are mainly dealt with in civil law proceedings. The German competent authorities, which are both authorities at the national level (particularly the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM)) and at the regional level (the administrative authorities in the respective federal states) have a range of enforcement powers. As well as the power to prosecute a company and/or individual responsible, the competent authorities have investigatory powers enabling them to enter, inspect and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authorities can also suspend or revoke any German marketing authorization or manufacturing authorization, wholesale dealer authorization, thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities. As regards enforcement of the restrictions on promotional activities, in practice this is typically done through civil law proceedings brought by competitors and/or associations for fair competition. _Enforcement Under Italian Law_ European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is enforced in Italy under criminal and administrative sanctions set forth in Legislative Decrees 211/2003 and 219/2006. A person guilty of an offense is generally liable to up to three years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine unless the act constitutes a more serious offense under the Italian Criminal Code. For instance, Article 443 of the Criminal Code makes the administration of faulty medicinal products (i.e., expired drugs) a punishable offense and provides for penalties of up to three years of imprisonment and unlimited fines. In addition, under Article 445 of the Criminal Code, the trade of medicinal substances, in species, quality or quantity not corresponding to medical orders, or different from that declared or agreed, is punishable with imprisonment of six months to two years and with a fine of A103-1,032. Moreover, Legislative Decree 211/2003 establishes the administrative liability of legal entities (including companies) for organizational negligence in cases in which an executive staff member or employee (i.e., a director, manager or senior executive) is convicted for certain criminal offenses (i.e., bribery and corruption, money laundering, corporate crimes, environmental crimes or crimes against industry and trade, etc.) committed, for the benefit or the advantage of the company, by its representatives. In particular, Legislative Decree 211/2003 sets out (i) monetary penalties (a fine up to Euro A1,549,000) and (ii) disqualifying measures, such as the suspension or revocation of licenses, authorizations and concessions (i.e., pharma licenses), a prohibition on entering into agreements with public entities (i.e., public tenders), disqualification from the performance of an activity, the exclusion or revocation of loans and contributions, and a ban against advertising goods and services. Companies may avoid this administrative liability by approving and actually implementing a suitable compliance program for the organization with a system of procedures and supervisory activities aimed at preventing the commission of such offenses, and appoint a Supervisory Body (Organismo di Vigilanza) aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the compliance program. However, the release from liability of the company depends on the ‘‘suitability judgement’’ and the determination on the preventive effectiveness of the organizational, administrative and control model, which the criminal judge must give in criminal proceedings to the detriment of the offender. This means that in the event of a final conviction for an 142 ----- offense listed in the catalogue of Legislative Decree 211/2003, if the criminal judge concerned finds that (i) the compliance program adopted by the company is not suitable for preventing the specific crime concerned, (ii) the compliance program has not been effectively implemented or (iii) the activities of the Supervisory Board are insufficient, the company will be liable and subject to the administrative penalties described above. In addition, the Italian authorities competent for pharmacovigilance are entrusted with a wide range of enforcement powers relevant to their own areas of competence, including (i) undertaking inspections and audits, (ii) modifying, suspending and revoking authorizations (including those for marketing, manufacturing, import, wholesale distribution and advertising) and (iii) issuing interdictory measures or monetary fines. _Enforcement Under Spanish Law_ The Spanish pharmaceutical industry enforcement regime mainly comprises administrative law rules and regulates the clinical investigation, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, pharmacovigilance and promotion of medicinal products. In line with European Union legislation, medicinal products must receive a marketing authorization granted by the Spanish Agency of Medicinal Products (‘‘AEMPS’’), which belongs to the Ministry of Health and Social Services, before medicinal products can be placed on the market. Additionally, manufacturers, importers and marketers of medicinal products are required to hold an authorization granted by the AEMPS. Authorization holders shall comply with security, effectiveness, identification and information obligations regarding the medicinal products marketed. Once the regulatory authorizations are granted, the latter are added to the AEMPS registry and communicated to the EMA for information purposes that are available to the public. Spanish state and regional authorities are empowered to investigate any conduct, to enter into any establishment or to seize any sample in order to verify compliance of the legislation. Failure to comply with the legislation may result in administrative fines that can be imposed on the authorization holder of up to A30,000 for minor infringements, A90,000 for serious infringements or A1,000,000, or five times the value of the medicinal products involved, for very serious infringements; seizure of the illegal benefit obtained; closure of the establishment; suspension of corresponding activities or/and the withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market. Additionally, if the aforementioned conduct, and other related conduct described in articles 361 et seq. of the Spanish Criminal Code, endanger human life and health, those provisions establish as penalties for the person who commits the criminal offense a prison sentence of up to four years, a fine which will depend on his or her economic situation and a specific disqualification from the exercise of his or her profession or from trading. In some circumstances the company itself can be liable for the conduct perpetuated by its employees, in which case, article 366 of the Spanish Criminal Code provides for fines up to five times the medicinal products involved and anticipates the possibility of also imposing other penalties, such as the winding up of the company, suspension of its activity, closure of its establishments, prohibition from carrying out its activities, prohibiting the obtaining public subsidies and judicial intervention.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,Russia,58.2.1,Overview,"The development, non-clinical/clinical trial development, registration, manufacture, safety, storage, transportation, advertising, sale, use and destruction of pharmaceuticals in the Russian Federation is strictly regulated by national laws, and since May 6, 2017 by the regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union (the ‘‘EAEU’’) on the united pharmaceutical market, formed by its members Armenia, Belorussia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia and Russia. The regulations of the EAEU as international law take precedence over national legislation. The EAEU regulations cover the registration of pharmaceuticals, labelling, packaging, good practices and pharmacovigilance. Obtaining clinical trial approvals, licensing, price formation, state procurement and advertising are the exclusive competence of each member state. _Non-clinical/Clinical Trial Development_ Prior to applying for the registration of a pharmaceutical product, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are arranged by a ‘‘sponsor,’’ if necessary. The sponsor is the organization with a license to conduct pharmaceutical activities, which owns the results of the studies and/or the relevant pharmaceutical 143 ----- manufacturing technologies. All studies must confirm the pharmaceutical quality of the products and demonstrate their safety and efficacy. For non-clinical studies (biomedical studies not performed on human subjects), the laboratory where the relevant research takes place is subject to strict controls by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. Pursuant to EAEU legislation, preclinical research on animals shall not be conducted with respect to generic drugs. The sponsor is obligated to conduct relevant studies according to the clinical trial permission granted by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Such permission is granted after the Ministry conducts a review of the application and accompanying documents submitted by the sponsor or any person authorized by the developer. Clinical research conducted on humans is subject to stringent regulations imposed by the Ministry of Health and the Ethical Board of the Russian Federation. In particular, a person conducting such research (i.e., the ‘‘principal investigator’’) must have relevant experience consisting of at least three years of studies in clinical trials and extensive medical practice in the relevant therapeutic area. In addition, the institution where the research takes place must be authorized by the Ministry of Health. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Successful results of clinical trials are a mandatory condition for the registration of a pharmaceutical product. _Registration Process_ Pharmaceuticals can be manufactured, stored, transported, sold, used or destroyed only upon obtaining a registration certificate (or a marketing authorization) issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. At the applicant’s option, the registration procedure can be carried out in accordance with Russian or EAEU regulations. Depending on the option chosen, an issued registration certificate will be valid in the territory of the Russian Federation or in all EAEU member states, respectively. After December 31, 2020, applicants for new registrations must file documents only with the EAEU (the national procedure will not be applicable). All valid registration dossiers of those pharmaceuticals that were previously registered under national rules must be brought into full compliance with the unified rules of the EAEU by December 31, 2025. Under Russian regulations, the duration of the registration process ranges from 80 working days (for the registration of the first three generic pharmaceuticals) to 130 working days (for generic and original pharmaceuticals), excluding a possible suspension for up to 90 days. EAEU regulations envisage 210 calendar days as the maximum duration of the registration process, excluding two possible suspensions of up to 90 days each. Clinical trials are not included in that term. Usually the whole registration process takes at least one and a half to two years for original and approximately eight to twelve months for generic pharmaceuticals. Usually, the official fee for the examination of pharmaceuticals amounts to 325,000 plus an additional28APR202007553764 28APR20200755376410,000 in order to obtain a registration certificate issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The cost of clinical trials is calculated individually for each pharmaceutical and is not included in the official fee. EAEU registration official fees are approved at the governmental level. The results of clinical trials conducted in other EAEU states as well as in the member states of the International Conference on the Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use may be accepted as part of the application. After being granted, the registration certificate can be annulled by the Ministry of Health for a number of reasons, including danger to health, infringement of the rights of a third-party in the absence of the pharmaceutical from the Russian market for more than three years, among others. Violations such as manufacturing or selling of unregistered pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to 28APR2020075537645,000,000 or to the suspension of the licensed activity for up to 90 days. Suspension of the activity can only be ordered by a court. If violations have not been remedied after the expiration of the suspension period, the license for manufacturing pharmaceuticals (see below) can be annulled upon application of the appropriate regulatory body by a ruling of the court. If the value of the manufactured or sold unregistered pharmaceuticals exceeds 100,000, an individual28APR202007553764 (such as a senior executive or another employee of the company) found responsible may be subject to criminal sanctions of up to eight years of imprisonment and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 3,000,000 or28APR202007553764 144 ----- (ii) the income of the offender for a period from six months to three years. The offender may also be prohibited from occupying certain posts or engaging in certain activities for up to five years. In the case of the death of two or more people or grievous harm caused by an unregistered pharmaceutical, the term of imprisonment can be up to twelve years with a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 5,000,000 or28APR202007553764 (ii) the income of the responsible person for a period of two to five years. The offender may also be prohibited from occupying certain posts or engaging in certain activities for up to ten years. _Manufacturing and Distributing Pharmaceuticals_ Manufacturing pharmaceuticals requires a license and a GMP certificate, both of which are issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. Manufacturing pharmaceuticals without a license is a criminal offense and may lead to imprisonment for up to eight years and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 3,000,000 or (ii) the income of the offender for one to three years.28APR202007553764 If ethanol is used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical substance, it must be recorded in the Unified State Automated System (‘‘USAS’’) (‘‘28APR202007553907’’) in order to control the volumes and circulation of pharmaceutical products containing alcohol. Failure to comply with the USAS record requirements can lead to a fine of up to 200,000 and to the confiscation of the pharmaceutical products. On January 1,28APR202007553764 2018, new requirements relating to ethanol usage entered into force. Pursuant to these new requirements, if ethanol (or ethanol as a pharmaceutical substance) is used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products or medical devices, it must be recorded in USAS in order to control the volumes of manufacture and circulation of pharmaceutical products containing alcohol. For laboratory activities that use agents that cause infectious diseases and genetically modified organisms of a pathogenicity level of III and IV, a company needs a license or has to rely on companies with such licenses. The license is issued by the Federal Service on Surveillance for Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-being. A major change of control of a license-holder entity is subject to prior approval by a special governmental committee. The distribution (whether wholesale or retail) of pharmaceuticals requires a license for pharmaceutical activity, issued by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. A recent law (dd. April 3, 2020 No. 105-FZ) allows the online purchase and sale of OTC drugs, although the Russian government is still considering the mechanics required for the implementation of such law. The manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals containing narcotics, psychotropic substances or their precursors is subject to an additional license for the circulation of such substances. The license is issued by the Federal Service for Supervision in Healthcare of the Russian Federation. Violation of the regulations the manufacture or distribution of pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to 28APR20200755376430,000 provided such actions do not violate licensing requirements (mandatory requirements with which license holder must comply). As a general rule, violation of any licensing requirements can lead to a fine of 28APR202007553764up to 40,000. Major violations of the license requirements can lead to a fine of up to 200,000 or a28APR202007553764 suspension of the licensed activity (e.g., distribution) for up to 90 days. The activity can be suspended only upon a ruling by a court. If major violations have not been remedied after the expiration of the suspension period, the license can be annulled upon application to a court by the respective regulatory body. _Pharmacovigilance (Pharmaceutical Safety Monitoring)_ A company is required to establish a phamacovigilance system, which includes the appointment of a qualified person to collect, assess and report safety information with regard to the benefit/risk assessment of the product and any adverse events. After a product registration certificate has been granted, the registration certificate holder must submit periodic safety reports to the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. In addition, the registration certificate holder must continuously monitor the benefit/risk balance of the product and implement and monitor procedures for the performance of adverse event collection, evaluation and reporting, the updating of risk management plans and must take other pharmacovigilance measures. The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare will inform the Ministry of Health of any negative safety information it obtains, as a result of which the latter can suspend the circulation of the pharmaceutical or revoke the registration certificate. 145 ----- For the nondisclosure of adverse events, the registration certificate holder can be charged with a fine of up 28APR202007553764to 70,000. If such nondisclosure creates a danger to people, animals or the environment, the individual responsible may bear criminal liability and be charged with a fine of up to 300,000 and imprisoned for up28APR202007553764 to two years. The offender may also be prohibited from holding certain positions and engaging in certain activities for a period of up to three years or, in the case of serious harm caused by such non-disclosure, the offender can be charged with a fine of up to 500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years.28APR202007553764 _Promotion of Pharmaceuticals_ The promotion of registered pharmaceuticals is permitted, subject to certain restrictions. For example, the advertising of pharmaceuticals may not: (i) contain specific cases of recovery or expressions of gratitude from patients, (ii) create an impression of the advantages of the product by referring to mandatory clinical trials, (iii) create an impression of the necessity of using the advertised product for certain diseases, (iv) create an impression of the absence of the need to consult a healthcare professional, (v) guarantee the positive impact or safety of, and the absence of any side effects caused by, the advertised product, (vi) advertise a pharmaceutical product as a biologically active supplement or (vii) claim that the safety and efficiency of the pharmaceutical product are guaranteed by its natural origin. Prescription pharmaceuticals can be advertised only during special events for healthcare professionals or in media specially designated for healthcare professionals. In such cases, advertising may refer to specific patient case studies. Prescription pharmaceuticals may not be advertised to consumers. Advertising compliance is regulated by the Federal Antitrust Service of the Russian Federation. Violation of the pharmaceuticals advertising legislation can lead to a fine up to 28APR202007553764500,000 for each individual violation. _VEP Circulation_ The Russian government approves a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (‘‘VEP’’) annually. This list includes international nonproprietary names of pharmaceuticals for treating the most common or top priority conditions. VEPs’ maximum prices must be approved by and registered with the Ministry of Health and Federal Antitrust Service. Overpricing can result in a fine of double the amount of excess earnings (i.e., the amount earned by the overcharge) for the period of the violations, up to a maximum period of one year. VEPs produced abroad are subject to restrictions for state procurement purposes: if two or more national or EAEU analogous products participate in a state procurement procedure, the foreign product is excluded from the tender. National manufacturers of VEPs can also apply for subsidies from the government.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

These obligations include: prescribed time periods in which a competent authority must respond to an application for approval of the price of or increase in the price of a medicinal product (where such approval is required before the product can be marketed or the price increase implemented, respectively); obligations to regularly review price freezes to consider the justification of such price freezes and prescribed time periods for announcing the results of such reviews; requirements to give reasons for certain decisions; obligations to publish prescribed information and provide prescribed information to the Commission regarding products for which prices have been fixed and the prices that may be charged, including any price increases; and time periods for communicating decisions (including exclusions) on whether reimbursement of a medicinal product will be covered by a national health insurance system. These obligations include communicating criteria used by national social security systems for the therapeutic classification of medicinal products as well as criteria used by competent authorities to verify transfer pricing used by companies for active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediatemanufactured or finished medicinal products. Member States are also obligated to publish information and to communicate to the Commission regarding the methods and criteria they apply to define profitability, return on sales and/or return on 146 ----- capital, including the ranges of target profit permitted and the maximum percentage of profit permitted to persons placing medicinal products on the market.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products,58.3.2,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Germany,"_Reimbursement Regime_ Health insurance coverage is compulsory in Germany. There are two different types of insurance: (i) statutory health insurance and (ii) private health insurance. For an employee, membership in the statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless their income rises above an annually determined threshold. In the German healthcare system medicinal products are reimbursed to the patient, either by the statutory health insurance, in which case the patient does not need to pay directly for the products (except for a low co-payment), or by the private health insurance, in which case the patient first pays for the product and then receives a reimbursement from the private health insurer. For reimbursements of medicinal products under statutory health insurance, a distinction needs to be made between prescription drugs and nonprescription drugs. Prescription-only medicinal products are only available on prescription by a doctor, dentist or veterinarian (Section 48 of the German Medicinal Products Act). In general, under current rules and regulations, the reimbursement system applies to all prescription drugs with the exception of: - medicinal products for the treatment of colds and flu-like infections, including cold remedies, painkillers, cough steaming treatment or cough expectorants; - mouth and throat therapeutics not involving fungal infection; - laxatives; - medication for travel sickness; - medication that primarily focuses on improving the quality of life; - erectile dysfunction; - increase of sexual potency; - cessation of smoking; - emaciation; - curbing appetite; - weight regulation; and - improvement of hair growth. The reimbursement of nonprescription medicinal products is restricted. In general, nonprescription products are not part of the reimbursement system if the insured person is more than twelve years old and does not have a developmental disorder before the end of the 18th year of life (Section 34 para.1 of Volume V of the Social Insurance Code). Outside the reimbursement framework manufacturers are permitted to set prices at will. _Price-Setting_ For the sale of medicinal products, German law provides for a pricing framework to ensure consistent prices for the same medicinal products. For the ‘‘pharmaceutical entrepreneur’’ (usually the marketing authorization holder) of medicinal products, the principle of free pricing for products generally applies. However, a restriction on free pricing may result from the ‘‘benefit assessment’’ according to the Social Insurance Code. In essence, the marketing authorization holder must prove additional benefits over comparable available products. If the marketing authorization holder fails and there is no therapeutic improvement on the basis of the benefit assessment then the medicinal product will be added to the existing reference pricing list. This also has an economic pressure effect on the marketing authorization holder to reduce prices to the existing reference pricing list in order to be competitive in the market. If an innovative (i.e., nongeneric) medicinal product demonstrates additional benefits because there is a therapeutic improvement then the price can be negotiated between the marketing authorization holder and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds. For products in the generics market there is a mandatory discount of 10% of the ex-factory price if they are distributed at the expense 147 ----- of the public health care system (Section 130a of Volume V of the Social Insurance Code). There can also be other restrictions in Volume V of the Social Insurance Code, such as a regulation of reference prices and compulsory manufacturer discounts. In addition, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur must guarantee a uniform sales price for medicinal products that are to be dispensed exclusively in pharmacies and are subject to reimbursement by the statutory health insurance. In the case of nonprescription medicinal products that are to be reimbursed by the statutory health insurance, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur shall specify its uniform sales price from which exceptions may be made in individual cases (Section 78 of the Medicinal Products Act).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products,58.3.3,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in England & Wales,"In England and Wales, the measures adopted for regulating the pricing of medicines vary according to the type of medicine. The generic term ‘‘Government’’ is used in this context to refer to the Department of Health and other United Kingdom NHS bodies running the public health service in England and Wales. _Branded Medicines_ The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2014 (the ‘‘PPRS’’) is a voluntary scheme open to manufacturers and suppliers which regulates the pricing of branded medicines (including branded generics) supplied to the United Kingdom NHS and which was in place until the end of 2018. It therefore did not cover sales of unbranded generics to the United Kingdom NHS or any sales outside the United Kingdom NHS (e.g., private prescription sales or non-United Kingdom NHS OTC sales). According to Government figures released at the end of 2016, in 2015 almost 90% of branded medicines supplied to the United Kingdom NHS were supplied by PPRS members. Key features of the PPRS was as follows: - A profit cap for individual members who elected to be part of the scheme and a general repayment across all members where United Kingdom NHS spend on branded medicines exceeds predicted growth levels. - In relation to product pricing, there is freedom of pricing at launch where new active substances were granted marketing authorization, including line extensions of such new medicines within five years of the marking authorization. However, this freedom was limited by an expectation that pricing would be ‘‘close’’ to value assessments for new medicines provided by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (now called the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), an executive non-departmental Government body. - All other pricing, including price increases or variations, are subject to Governmental consent. There were flexible pricing options or special rules for defined scenarios (such as new indications), but the Government generally had discretion as to what was accepted. Therefore, under the PPRS, although the technical position is freedom of pricing at launch, there were notable constraints on individual product pricing and the profit/repayment mechanisms influence PPRS members’ pricing across their portfolios. The PPRS was not a reimbursement scheme as such, but rather a system to control the profitability of persons placing branded medicinal products on the market. The Government does not use external reference pricing for medicines, but United Kingdom prices are often used as reference pricing elsewhere and the above factors will be relevant where that is the case. The PPRS expired on December 31, 2018. In a November 23, 2018 announcement, the Government and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry confirmed that the replacement will be called the 2019 Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing and Access (and known as ‘‘the Voluntary Scheme’’ for short). It is believed that the full final contents of the Voluntary Scheme will be published during December 2018. Based on preliminary indications to industry, there is as yet no reason to expect significant divergence from the current PPRS on the above points, but that is dependent on last-minute negotiation and potential changes to the announced position. _The Statutory Scheme_ Suppliers of branded medicines that elected not to be subject to the PPRS or which were required to leave the PPRS by virtue of a notice served by the Secretary of State are subject to a statutory scheme for sales to 148 ----- the United Kingdom NHS. The statutory scheme in force since April 1, 2018 replaced a system involving a mandatory 15% price cut on the United Kingdom NHS list price of medicines on sale on December 1, 2013 with the following two forms of price regulations: - a repayment mechanism based on a percentage of suppliers’ net sales income (which is initially 7.8% and which is expected to be 9.9% for 2019) and modelled on that currently applicable under the PPRS; and - a mechanism for the setting of maximum prices that may be charged by a manufacturer or supplier, unless in either case the medicines were procured under a contract subject to public procurement legislation entered into on or before April 1, 2018 and/or entered into following a tender that closed on or before that date (including call-off contracts under a framework agreement entered into on or before that date, even if the call off itself is entered into after that date). The Government has recently consulted on amendments to the statutory scheme rules and is expected to make amendments to the statutory scheme. _Unbranded Generics_ In principle, there is freedom of pricing for unbranded generic prescription-only pharmaceuticals, which are subject to competition on the open market. However, the following two factors may influence prices charged by generic suppliers: - The price at which pharmacists are reimbursed for dispensing prescription generics is set by the ‘‘Drug Tariff,’’ Part VIIIA of which lists reimbursement prices for the vast majority of generic prescription pharmaceuticals. Different methods for calculating reimbursement pricing have been applied to different categories of generics. However, the Health Service Products (Provision and Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2018 introduced mandatory information retention, and mandatory information provision on request, in relation to sales and income provision by all suppliers of unbranded generics to facilitate Drug Tariff pricing. Although some provisions of these June 2018 Regulations came into force in January 2019, the provisions relating to information on unbranded generics are already in force. - Section 262 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (as amended in 2017 by the Health Service Medical Supplies Costs Act 2017) grants the Government power to limit any price charged by the supplier of any medicine to the United Kingdom NHS where that medicine is not covered by a voluntary scheme. This would in theory apply to (i) branded medicines subject to the statutory scheme, (ii) unbranded generics, (iii) OTC medicines dispensed under a prescription unless caught by the PPRS (see ‘‘—OTC Sales’’) or (iv) a medicine sold OTC to the United Kingdom NHS. However, any enforcement under s262 requires a proactive step by the Government and consultation with a relevant industry body (such as a trade association). _OTC Sales_ The only potential pricing constraint on the sale of products that are actually sold OTC is s262 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (see ‘‘—Unbranded Generics’’), and then only for OTC sales to the United Kingdom NHS. Otherwise, the sale of products OTC is free on the open market. Where OTC medicines are prescribed on the United Kingdom NHS, two features may influence a supplier’s pricing: - The cost of purchasing and dispensing an OTC medicine prescribed on the United Kingdom NHS is in principle reimbursable to community pharmacies, unless it features on a ‘‘black list’’ of nonreimbursable products that forms part of the Drug Tariff. - Where an OTC medicine’s prescription sales are below £50,000, the Government may exercise discretion to exclude such sales from PPRS calculations relevant to the profit cap and the industry repayment. A PPRS member company should therefore note that any sales of prescribed OTC products will count towards such calculations, where the Government has not exercised this discretion. For non-PPRS members, the Government has confirmed that OTC sales (including where OTC products are prescribed) are not subject to the statutory scheme. 149 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products,58.3.4,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Italy,"In order to be placed on the market, medicinal products must be priced and assigned (by AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency) to a class (i.e., classes A, H, C and C-bis). These classes are used to identify whether or not the cost of a medicinal product is charged to the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario _Nazionale) (the ‘‘Italian NHS’’). The costs of medical products assigned to classes A and H are wholly_ borne by the Italian NHS (i.e., reimbursable); some of them are refundable only in hospitals. By contrast, the patient has to bear the costs for medicinal products in classes C and C-bis (i.e., nonreimbursable). The class of refundability is identified during the marketing authorization procedure. Class A includes essential products and those intended for chronic diseases (e.g., antibiotics, antidiabetic and antitumor medicines), and are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS. To acquire these products, a valid prescription must be obtained. Class H includes products requiring specialist supervision that are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS if dispensed in hospitals. Class C includes other products that do not have the characteristics of class A or class H and are not reimbursed by the Italian NHS. In particular, they are medicinal products used for minor diseases, which are therefore not considered to be ‘‘essential’’ or ‘‘life-saving.’’ Class C includes prescription-only medicinal products as well as nonprescription-only medicinal products which cannot be advertised to the public. With Law 311/2004 (Budget Law 2005), a new range of medicinal products was established, the C-bis class, which includes nonprescription-only medicinal products which may be advertised to the public (OTC products). The mechanism for determining the prices of medicinal products differs depending on whether they are reimbursable or not. In particular, AIFA applies price regulation only to reimbursed medicines. For non-reimbursable medicines (class C), the price is set freely by pharmaceutical companies but is monitored by AIFA and the Ministry of Health in order to keep prices at reasonable levels. Although, in principle, the prices of class C medicinal products are set freely by pharmaceutical companies, in practice they have been increasingly regulated by legislative provisions according to which pharmaceutical companies may only increase prices of class C pharmaceuticals every other January. The prices assigned by manufacturers are maximum prices nationwide. Price reductions by manufacturers are allowed at any time, while price increases are allowed in January of odd years. With reference to classes C and C-bis medicinal products, however: (i) as to medicinal products that are subject to medical prescription, AIFA carries out monitoring action aimed at verifying compliance with two main conditions: (i) that the price of medicinal products can be increased every two years (in odd years); and (ii) that the increase may not exceed the target inflation rate; and (ii) as to medicinal products that are not subject to medical prescription, the price is freely determined by manufacturers. With reference to classes A and H medicinal products, a specific negotiation procedure between AIFA and pharmaceutical companies holding marketing authorizations is provided for in the applicable legislation in order to determine the price of the relevant medicinal products. The negotiation procedure is conducted according to the following criteria: therapeutic value, pharmacovigilance data, prices in other European Union countries, prices of similar products within the same pharmaceutical therapeutic group, internal market forecasts, the number of potential patients and therapeutic innovation. In order to determine the price of medicinal products, the negotiation between AIFA and pharmaceutical companies requires completion of a four-stage procedure: (i) Pharmaceutical companies file with AIFA a specific reimbursement and pricing request supported by a dossier aimed at proving: (a) a positive cost/benefit ratio (which means that the medicinal product (x) is to be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no effective treatment, or provides a more appropriate response in respect of products already available for the same therapeutic indications; or (y) presents a more favorable risk/benefit ratio if compared with other medicinal products already available); or (b) other elements of interest for the NHS, if the medicinal product does not present a significant clinical superiority compared with to other products already available or that it is at least as effective and safer that other products already available. (ii) AIFA’s Technical Scientific Committee (‘‘CTS’’) provides its opinion on reimbursement by an evaluation of the clinical therapeutic value. 150 ----- (iii) AIFA’s Pricing and Reimbursement Committee evaluates the dossier, also taking into consideration the consumer spending data provided by the National Observatory on the Use of Medicines (OSMED), and hears from the company as part of the negotiation. (iv) The outcome of the negotiation is submitted to the CTS for its final opinion and then to AIFA’s Management Board for approval. The results of the negotiation procedure are published in the Italian Official Gazette. A price agreement reached between AIFA and the manufacturer of the medicinal product lasts 24 months and is subject to automatic renewal for an additional period of 24 months unless previously terminated by either party. In the event of changes in the therapeutic indications of a medicinal product leading to a potential increase in its use, the negotiation must be re-opened before the expiration of the agreement. It is common practice to establish a proportionate relationship between the price paid and the volume of sales of the medicinal product under the negotiation procedure. If there is no agreement on the price, then the medicinal product is classified as not reimbursable and listed in class C. As a general principle, the price of medicinal products, which includes VAT (applied at a rate of 10%), includes the ex-factory value (which is the price of industry revenue) and the amounts due to wholesalers and pharmacists. The pricing negotiation procedure for generics does not differ from that of other medicines, although, based on applicable regulations, the manufacturer should guarantee at least a 20% price reduction below the price of the originator reference medicinal product. The Italian NHS only reimburses classes A and H medicinal products; no reimbursement is provided for class C medicinal products. In Italy, a reference price system (‘‘RPS’’)—which is one of the instruments used to control public expenditure on pharmaceutical products—has been in effect since 2001. Under the RPS, the Italian NHS reimburses the lowest price among the prices of off-patent medicinal products made with equal composition in active ingredients, with the same pharmaceutical form, the same method of administration, the same number of units and the same unit dosage. When patients refuse the substitution of a medicine eligible for generic substitution and/or if the doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical product with a price higher than the reference price and specifically provides that the said pharmaceutical product cannot be substituted with other products, the difference is paid by the patient. In Italy, medicinal products are traditionally distributed by pharmacies. Exceptions include a few widely used or very expensive products, which are distributed directly by the Local Health Authorities (‘‘LHAs’’) and by hospitals. Drug reimbursement is made by the LHAs to the pharmacies. Once a medicinal product is authorized, it is not immediately eligible for reimbursement. As a very general principle, reimbursement is provided for essential medicinal products, namely products: (i) for diseases for which no therapeutic alternative exists; (ii) for which the medicinal products already available on the market do not provide a satisfactory or appropriate answer; and (iii) which present a better cost/benefit and risk/benefit analysis than those offered by medicinal products already on the market. Even in the absence of these characteristics, medicinal products that are as safe and effective as those already on the market may be reimbursable depending on the result of their cost/benefit evaluation. When evaluating eligibility for reimbursement, AIFA also takes into consideration the following factors in relation to the medicinal products: the sales price in other European Union member states; the therapeutic class; the foreseen market share in the following 24 months; the impact on expenditures for the Italian NHS; and its place in the industrial environment. To apply for reimbursement, the marketing authorization holder must submit an application alongside documentation proving, among other things, a positive cost/ benefit ratio to demonstrate that the medicinal products is to be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no medical care, or that it provides more adequate treatment compared to other medicinal products already on the market. Finally, please note that the procedural rules illustrated above and the criteria for the negotiation of the refundability and price of medicinal products by the Italian NHS, between AIFA and the pharmaceutical companies, will probably change in near future. More precisely, already in July 2019, the Ministry of Health, in agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, issued a draft decree on new procedures for negotiating the refundability and price of medicinal products. The legislative text has already received a favorable opinion from the State—Regions Conference and is now continuing its procedure for registration by the Court of Auditors and publication in the Official Journal of the Italian Republic. However, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the legislation has not entered into force. This does 151 ----- not, however, mean that completely new regulations will be introduced, but only that some of the existing rules regarding the agreement between the pharmaceutical companies and AIFA, concerning the refundability and price of medicinal products marketed in Italy, will be subject to amendments in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products,58.3.5,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Spain,"Public reimbursement of medicinal products is tightly regulated by Spanish legislation under the equality principle within the whole Health National System (the ‘‘HNS’’) and only applies to those prescription medicinal products (prescribed by pharmacies, hospitals or healthcare centers) that have been previously included in the HNS through a specific authorization granted by the state authorities. Medicines covered by the HNS do not include OTC medicines, but do include some generics prescription. All medicines not included in the HNS can be priced freely on the open market, subject to a notification issued to the State Authorities. State authorities (i.e., the Health Ministry) approve the prices and reimbursement conditions for the authorized medicinal prescription products that apply all over the territory mainly taking into account the characteristics of the pathologies involved, public expenditure rationalization, the impact on the public budget, a cost-effectiveness analysis and the existence of similar medicinal products. Generally, the maximum reimbursement price (the ‘‘Industry Price’’) will be equal to or below the price that would apply if the corresponding medicinal products were dispensed to patients who are not beneficiaries of the HNS. To settle the Industry Price, the pharmaceutical industry is obligated to provide to the state authorities all the information on technical, financial and economic matters related to the relevant medicinal product. Public reimbursement is subject to the reference price system (the ‘‘RPS’’), which is the maximum amount that the corresponding prescribed medicinal product included in each medicinal group (with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient and route of administration) will be public reimbursed, i.e., the RPS is a product group pricing benchmark that will influence the Industry Price for an individual product where the relevant product group has previously been allocated a reference price. The RPS is set by taking into account the lowest cost/treatment/length of treatment of the medicinal products of each group. The retail price is based on the RPS, adding wholesale and pharmacy commercial margins, respectively, which are tightly regulated by the state authorities. The Industry Price of a particular medicinal product represents the maximum price at which an HNS medicine will be reimbursed at the manufacturing level. The marketing authorization holder who will deliver into the supply chain (typically, to a wholesaler who will sell it on to a pharmacy) will therefore be aware of the maximum price that it will collect. Wholesaler and pharmacy margins are be fixed by legislation. The retail price equals the Industry Price plus the wholesale and pharmacy commercial margins. Once the Industry Price is fixed, it is be updated annually by the state authorities and can be modified if changes in financial and technical circumstances or the evaluation of their therapeutic use so warrants. State authorities are entitled to proceed with the necessary inspections in order to verify if the maximum prices are being adhered to, and if they are not, state authorities can initiate penalty proceedings that may lead to the imposition of fines and the seizure of the medicinal products affected in the case of a breach. Pricing set in other jurisdictions cannot replace the equivalent price in Spain without a particular resolution issued by the state authorities which establishes the price, which can be equal to or different from the price of other jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products,58.3.6,Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Russia,"In Russia, there are two types of reimbursement schemes: (1) For all in-patients and emergency care (under the Federal Fund for Mandatory Medical Insurance). This scheme covers all pharmaceutical products that a patient receives in a hospital (e.g., prescription-only medicines and any OTC medicines). The pharmaceutical products must be included in a standard of care developed by the Ministry of Health for the particular disorder and in the ‘‘essential drugs’’ list (‘‘VEP’’), a list of drugs which should be made available in an in-patient setting, and which is used as the basis for a number of out-patient reimbursement schemes (See ‘‘—Russia—Overview—VEP _Circulation’’). In the case of an individual patient not responding to treatment with a VEP medicine or_ having an adverse reaction to a VEP, the medical panel may substitute a non-VEP medicine. 152 ----- (2) For out-patients. The out-patient reimbursement schemes include: (a) the ONLS (Population Drug Coverage) scheme covering eligible categories of patients; (b) the VZN scheme (also referred to as the ‘‘High-cost nosologies’’ scheme) covering patients with high-cost diseases, including mucoviscidosis and multiple sclerosis, which are together referred to as the DLO scheme; and (c) other schemes also covering certain groups of patients (e.g., patients suffering from orphan diseases, children under three years of age and others). Depending on their entitlement, out-patients are eligible to receive either free or partially subsidized prescription medicines. In order to receive benefits, some patients (e.g., veterans and disabled persons) are required to present authorization documents confirming their status and can obtain a wide range of drugs for different disorders. Other patients must be included in the federal register for specified disorders and can only obtain the medicines that are included in the list of the drugs relevant to their disorder. A prescription is issued by a consulting physician. An out-patient can obtain necessary drugs in authorized (state or municipal) drugstores. The general rules of VEP pricing are described under ‘‘—Russia—Overview—VEP Circulation.’’ A VEP drugs manufacturer can apply annually to re-register (to increase) a price under the rules set by the government to recover the manufacturer’s operating costs. Distributors and drugstores can each apply a mark-up that is limited by regional legislatures. Federal and regional authorities have the right to control retail prices and pricing during procurement procedures. All reimbursable pharmaceutical products are purchased by hospitals and authorized drugstores solely through public procurement procedures which tender for drugs by reference to their INN (taking into account the dosage, dosage form and other significant features of medicinal products), their compliance with the registered price with respect to VEP (overpricing is prohibited in the case of VEP subject of public procurement) and which give priority to medicinal products from EAEU countries in an auction. Non-VEP product pricing is not regulated by the state. If the products subject to public procurement procedures are not VEP, the initial maximum contract price in the context of public procurement procedures is defined using the current market price. The Order of the Ministry of Health ‘‘On the Approval of the Public Pharmacare Strategy in the Russian Federation till 2025 and its Implementation Schedule’’ sets forth a new reimbursement system in Russia, to be implemented in the future. Pilot projects have been introduced in selected regions. For example, the Kirov region has set up a co-payment scheme whereby a patient pays only 10% of the price of cardiovascular disease medicines with the remaining 90% being funded from the regional budget. Several other reimbursement models are under consideration, including the introduction of a reference pricing system of interchangeable drugs under which patients, if they choose, will be required to pay any difference between the reference price of the generic version and the actual price of the desired original product. 153 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Original Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Original Issue Date, such later date).

Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.14,Change of Control,60.14.1,,"The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third-party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to A100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof; _provided that Senior Secured Notes of_ A100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at 210 ----- the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third-party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event. 211 ----- The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments (as defined below) under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Original Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below) shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Original Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Original Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on _Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and the Restricted_ Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this ‘‘Limitation on _Indebtedness.’’_ If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this ‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; _provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other 219 ----- costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (a) A50.0 million and (b) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied: (a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; _provided _further that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or_ purchase any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended such offer to the Holders on at least a _pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this paragraph (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds; or (b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds, _provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_ accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. 229 ----- Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On the 361st day (or such longer period permitted by clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture exceeds A50.0 million in a single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 360 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that the Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Secured Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euros. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) 230 ----- and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Original Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (a) A100.0 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. The Senior Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Senior Secured Notes would constitute a Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Senior Secured Security Documents except as provided in such Senior Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the 243 ----- time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘144A Book Entry Interests’’) and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book Entry Interest’’ and, together with the 144A Book Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Book Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book Entry Interests. In addition, while the Additional Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Additional Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Additional Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or ‘‘holder’’ of Additional Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture for any purpose. So long as the Additional Notes are held in global form, the common depositary Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect. Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes, including the effect of any state or local or church taxes under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.43,Withholding Tax,60.43.1,,"Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Additional Notes who is a German tax resident (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management is located in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Additional Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with or presented for an over the counter payment to a German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, securities trading company or securities trading bank (each, a ‘‘Disbursing Agent’’, auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f¨ur Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for church tax. The Senior Notes Issuer of the Additional Notes should under German law not be required to deduct withholding tax from the proceeds of the investment in the Additional Notes. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Additional Notes (‘‘Accrued Interest’’ St¨uckzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the Additional Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Additional Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims if the Additional Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent that the Additional Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Additional Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the EEA or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Additional Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Additional Notes or other securities paid 295 ----- separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die _Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_ withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Additional Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Additional Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined below under ‘‘—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents’’) and the Additional Notes are held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Income derived from capital investments under the Additional Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Additional Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die Eingetragene _Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a_ capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Additional Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under ‘‘—Withholding Tax’’ above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Additional Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Additional Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods. Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of A10,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of A10.000 can be carried forward and might be 296 ----- usable in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of A10.000 per year. Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the Additional Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz).

Generally a holder of Additional Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in the Dutch Guarantor if he holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily defined term in Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, shares representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Dutch Guarantor, or rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued, that represent at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Dutch Guarantor, or the ownership of certain profit participating certificates that relate to 5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Dutch Guarantor (a ‘‘Substantial Interest’’). A holder of Additional Notes will also have a Substantial Interest in the Dutch Guarantor if one of certain relatives of that holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in the Dutch Guarantor. If a holder of Additional Notes does not have a Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if (part of) a Substantial Interest has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without recognizing a taxable gain. _Dutch Resident Individuals_ A holder of Additional Notes who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Individual’’), will generally be subject to Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Additional Notes at the progressive rates up to 49.50% (maximum rate for 2020) if: (i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Additional Notes are attributable or deemed to be attributable; or (ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the Additional Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), which include the performance of activities with respect to the Additional Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief _belang)._ If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, regardless of the actual income or capital gains derived from the Additional Notes. This deemed return is calculated by applying the applicable deemed return percentage(s) to the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag), insofar this exceeds a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets (including, as the case may be, the Additional Notes) held by the Dutch Resident Individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both determined on January 1 of the relevant year. The deemed return percentages to be applied to the yield basis increase progressively from 1.79% to 5.28% (rates for 2020), depending on such individual’s yield basis. The deemed return percentages are adjusted annually. The deemed return will be taxed at a rate of 30% (rate for 2020). _Dutch Resident Entities_ A holder of Additional Notes that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity) and that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Entity’’), will generally be subject to Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Additional Notes. The Dutch corporate income tax rate is 16.50% for the first A200,000 of the taxable amount and 25% of the taxable amount exceeding A200,000 (rates for 2020). 300 ----- _Non-Dutch Residents_ A holder of Additional Notes who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch Resident Entity (a ‘‘Non-Dutch Resident’’), is generally not subject to Dutch income tax or Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Additional Notes, provided that: (i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste _vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case_ may be, the Additional Notes are attributable or deemed attributable; (ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or capital gains from the Additional Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ performed in The Netherlands (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden in _Nederland), as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), which include_ the performance of activities in respect of the Additional Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang); (iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Additional Notes or payments in respect of the Additional Notes are attributable; and (iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity), such entity is neither entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the Additional Notes or payments in respect of the Additional Notes are attributable.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the discussions below under ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,’’ and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or any considerations under any applicable income tax treaty. This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Code, Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Additional Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Additional Notes. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including, but not limited to, the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, alternative minimum tax, special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the Additional Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, or other pass-through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, persons purchasing or selling notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, and persons holding the Additional Notes as part of a ‘‘straddle,’’ ‘‘hedge,’’ ‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Additional Notes in the offering hereby at their initial ‘‘issue price’’ (generally the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes are sold for money to investors (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers)), and who hold the Additional Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of an Additional Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a 302 ----- corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more ‘‘United States persons’’ (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a ‘‘United States persons’’ (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code).

If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Additional Notes may be treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Under the applicable Treasury regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the issue date, such contingencies in the aggregate are considered ‘‘remote’’ or ‘‘incidental.’’ Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should be treated, in the aggregate, as remote and/or incidental within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Additional Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, we do not intend to treat any such potential payments as part of the yield to maturity of the Additional Notes. Our determination that this contingency is remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Additional Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, among other adverse tax consequences, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on its Additional Notes based upon a ‘‘comparable yield’’ (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in excess of stated interest, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income recognized on the taxable disposition of an Additional Note, and to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner different than that described below.

No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on an Additional Note in Euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on: - the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or - at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference between (i) the value of the Euros received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Additional Notes. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.55,Original Issue Discount,60.55.1,,"The Additional Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and consequently a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis before the U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The amount of OID includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Additional Notes for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Additional Notes. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an ‘‘accrual period’’ (other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will generally equal (a) the product of the ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ of the Additional Notes as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Additional Notes’ ‘‘yield to maturity’’ (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The term ‘‘qualified stated interest’’ generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Stated interest on the Additional Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. The ‘‘yield to maturity’’ is the discount rate that, when applied to all payments under the Additional Notes as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Additional Notes’ issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual period generally may be computed under any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount of the Additional Notes and the adjusted issue price of the Additional Notes at the beginning of the final accrual period. The ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ of an Additional Note as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder of the Additional Notes generally will be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. A U.S. Holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on the Additional Notes as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The election is to be made for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder acquired the Additional 304 ----- Notes and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election. A U.S. Holder of Additional Notes treated as issued with OID must (i) determine OID allocable to each accrual period in euros using the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the amount of OID into U.S. dollars and recognize foreign currency gain or loss in the same manner as described above for stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the taxable disposition of an Additional Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on an Additional Note will be viewed: first, as payments of stated interest payable on the Additional Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipts of principal. U.S. Holders should note that because the cash payment in respect of accrued OID on an Additional Note will not be made until maturity or other disposal of the Additional Note, a greater possibility exists for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (and the required recognition of exchange gain or loss) than is the case for foreign currency instruments issued without OID. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules. OID generally will be income from sources outside of the United States and generally will be considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted tax basis of an Additional Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase, decreased by the amount of any payments made on such Additional Note (other than payments of stated interest), and increased by any OID accrued by such U.S. Holder with respect to the Additional Notes. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the disposition of an Additional Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. If the Additional Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the U.S. dollar value of its adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note and the amount realized on the disposition of an Additional Note by translating Euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Additional Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any, recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Additional Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date (1) the Additional Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a 305 ----- U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to previously accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’ The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in this paragraph will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of an Additional Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ unless materially modified after such date.

That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Regulated Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. In addition, that presumption is rebuttable, and the relevant court of a Regulated Member State should carefully assess whether the centre of main interests is genuinely located in that Regulated Member State. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut the presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Regulated Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Regulated Member State (Recital (30) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). When determining whether the centre of main interests is ascertainable by third parties, special consideration should be given to the creditors and to their perception as to where a company conducts the administration of its interests. This may require, in the event of a shift of centre of main interests, informing creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in due course, for example by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence, or by making the new location public through other appropriate means (Recital (28) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). If the centre of main interests of the debtor is located in the Regulated Member State in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall be opened in that Regulated Member State and accordingly the courts of that Regulated Member State shall have jurisdiction to open any of the insolvency proceedings applicable in that Regulated Member State (see Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). Notwithstanding the opening of a main insolvency proceeding in a Regulated Member State, ‘‘secondary insolvency proceedings’’ may be opened in another Regulated Member State if such debtor possesses an ‘‘establishment’’ (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in that Member State. The effects of these proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor in the territory of that Regulated Member State. If the debtor possesses an ‘‘establishment’’ in a Regulated Member State, ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ under Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation may be opened prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings, where (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the center of the debtor’s main interests is situated or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Regulated Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, the territorial insolvency proceedings shall become secondary insolvency proceedings.

In the event of an insolvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in Germany (the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any other such Guarantor, a ‘‘German Notes Guarantor’’) at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the centre of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See ‘‘Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests—European Union.’’_ The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Additional Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on an up to two year forecast horizon (positive _Fortf¨uhrungsprognose). If a limited liability company (GmbH), a public limited liability company_ (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity and/or over indebtedness occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business can survive as a going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and/or is over indebted (Uberschuldung[¨] ) it may also file for preliminary debtor in possession moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which 309 ----- ideally shall be implemented in formal debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (the ‘‘COVInsAG’’), provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until September 30, 2020. The suspension applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic or there is no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If the debtor was able to pay its debts on December 31, 2019—so that the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig)—it is assumed that the insolvency was caused by the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic and that there are prospects of remedying an existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). The COVInsAG also provides that insolvency proceedings based on creditors’ insolvency filings in the period from March 28, 2020 to June 28, 2020 can only be opened if the event of illiquidity or over-indebtedness already existed on March 1, 2020. However, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection will be authorized by regulation to extend the suspensions until March 31, 2021 if this appears to be necessary due to the continuing demand for available public aid, ongoing financing difficulties, or other circumstances. The COVInsAG also provides for a relief from claw-back for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures the court sees as appropriate. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a ‘‘preliminary creditors’ committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: (a) a balance sheet total in excess of A6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); (b) revenues of at least A12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or (c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor in possession proceedings (Anordnung der _Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorl¨aufiger)_ _Sachwalter). The court opens_ formal insolvency proceedings (Er¨offnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the 310 ----- costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has ordered debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including the Guarantees. The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See ‘‘—Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the _Restructuring Directive’’)._ For the holders of the Additional Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s subject to the German insolvency regime would include the following: (a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the (preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorl¨aufiger) _Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; (b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; (c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (d) claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and (e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’ entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte _oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_ whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegl¨aubiger) as opposed to a 311 ----- preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or more as agreed upon individually) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (‘‘excess proceeds’’) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Additional Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Additional Notes). If a German Notes Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Additional Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Additional Notes by the German Notes Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Given the relatively 312 ----- recent enactment of these amendments, these provisions may not have been tested in practice and no judicial precedents are available in such respect. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis `a vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. As a general principle, the claims arising from a guarantee may be enforced against a German Notes Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Any insolvency proceeding over the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Notes Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency. On April 13, 2017, the German legislator passed an act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur _Erleichterung der Bew¨altigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018. This act is_ mainly intended to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. This act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’ (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordinator’’ (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan). German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may result in the holders of the Additional Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a ‘‘shareholder like position’’ (gesellschafter¨ahnliche _Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor, the_ claims arising from a Senior Secured Notes Guarantees would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under ‘‘—Satisfaction of _Subordinated Claims.’’_ During the suspension of filing obligations as set out in the preceding paragraph, the COVInsAG also provides for a relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not regarded against bones mores. This relief shall include deferrals and ‘‘amend & extend’’ transactions. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. _Limitations on Enforcement_ Some of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (GmbH) and/or a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, _‘‘GmbHG’’), the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and other laws. These provisions would also apply_ to any future German Notes Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG) or Aktiengesellschaft. 313 ----- _GmbH Limitation Language_ As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner, such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents, in particular in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, is substantially be in the form as follows: ‘‘ (a) The restrictions in this Clause shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and other payment obligations under this Clause or any other provision in this Indenture and/or any other documents in connection therewith granted by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Germany as a limited liability company (GmbH) (a ‘‘German GmbH Guarantor’’) to secure liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or indirect subsidiary of such Guarantor) (cross stream) (a ‘‘Guarantee’’). (b) The restrictions in this Clause shall not apply: (i) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent the German GmbH Guarantor secures any indebtedness under this Indenture in respect of (i) loans to the extent such loans are (directly or indirectly) on lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant German GmbH Guarantor or its subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the German GmbH Guarantor’s subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (b) shall have the effect that such on lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip); (ii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), if, at the time of enforcement of the Guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder _Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) as per Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)_ (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company, and: (A) that German GmbH Guarantor is a subsidiary of the relevant obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee, that Guarantor; or (B) the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee are both subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company and such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen), in each case to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement 314 ----- (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) leads to the inapplicability of section 30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG); (iii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent any payment under the Guarantee demanded by the Trustee from the relevant German GmbH Guarantor is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger _Gegenleistungs oder R¨uckgew¨ahranspruch) of the German GmbH Guarantor against the affiliate_ whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee; or (iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the Guarantee has been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this Clause because the Management Notification (as defined herein) and/or the Auditor’s Determination (as defined below) has not (or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four months from its due date in accordance with paragraph (e) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the German GmbH Guarantor repay any amount received from the German GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely manner. (c) The parties to this Indenture agree that if and to the extent payment under the Guarantee would cause (i) the amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets, as calculated and defined pursuant to paragraph (g) below, to fall below the amount required to maintain its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating sections 30, 31 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (such event, a ‘‘Capital Impairment’’), or (ii) a German GmbH Guarantor to be deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors and thereby violating Section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (such event, a ‘‘Liquidity Impairment’’) then the Trustee shall not enforce and the German GmbH Guarantor shall, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, have a defense (Einrede) against any claim under the Guarantee if and to the extent such Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur. (d) If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in (the ‘‘Management Notification’’) within fifteen (15) business days after the making of a demand against that German GmbH Guarantor under the Guarantee: (i) to what extent such Guarantee is an upstream or cross stream guarantee or indemnity; and (ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the Guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its Net Assets or to which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up to date pro forma balance sheet or liquidity statement), then the restrictions set out in this Clause shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been provided. (e) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) business days of its receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty five (45) business days of receipt of such request a determination by the German GmbH Guarantor’s auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation (the ‘‘Auditor’s Determination’’) appointed by the German GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Guarantee would cause a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment, subject to the terms set out under this Clause. Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties. (f) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any or only partial payment under the Guarantee, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions of the German GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially improved, the Trustee may (acting reasonably), at the German GmbH Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the German GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment 315 ----- has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the German GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Guarantee to the extent the auditors determine that the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment have been cured. (g) The net assets (Reinverm¨ogen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the ‘‘Net Assets’’) shall be calculated in accordance with section 42 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG), sections 242, 264 of the HGB and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from time to time in Germany (Grunds¨atze ordnungsgem¨aßer Buchf¨uhrung) and for the purposes of calculating the Net Assets, the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows: (i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Agreement and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerh¨ohung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant German GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under this Indenture and has been carried out without the prior written consent of the agent; (ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 253 subsection 6 of the HGB shall not be included in the calculation of Net Assets; (iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 268 subsection 8 of the HGB shall not be included in the calculation of Net Assets; (iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 272 subsection 5 of the HGB shall not be included in the calculation of Net Assets; and (v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly negligent violation of this Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities. (h) Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this Clause that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall (A) realize, to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not necessary (betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business, and (B) use best efforts to realize, to the extent legally permitted in a situation where it does not have sufficient liquidity to fulfil its liabilities to its creditors, any and all of its assets if the relevant asset is not necessary for the German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig). (i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this Indenture to the Trustee. (j) Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming in court that the provision of this Guarantee and/or making payments under this Guarantee by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does or does not fall within the scope of sections 30, 31 and/or 64 sentence 3 of the of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) and/or section 826 German Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch). (k) In addition to the restrictions set out in this Clause, if a German GmbH Guarantor demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any upstream or cross stream guarantee or security interest against such German GmbH Guarantor would result in personal liability of its managing director(s) (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) for a reimbursement of payments made under the Guarantee (including, without limitation, pursuant to section 826 of the German Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch)), the German GmbH Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against the Guarantee to the extent required in order not to incur such liability. (l) The provisions of this Clause shall apply to a limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) _mutatis mutandis and all references to Capital Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets shall be construed as a reference to the Capital Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets of the general partner (Komplement¨ar) of the German GmbH Guarantor. 316 ----- (m) For the purposes of this Clause, a reference to a ‘‘German GmbH Guarantor’’ includes any limited liability company incorporated (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner) in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is in Germany. (n) (n) The parties are aware that—due to recent developments—it is currently discussed which point in time is relevant when determining whether a managing director or other representative of a German guarantor has complied with the capital maintenance provisions. In respect of a valuation of the Net Assets which are available for enforcement of a guarantee without causing any liability for management, the parties consider the point in time of the enforcement of the Guarantee as being relevant which is therefore the relevant point in time for calculating the available Net Assets purposes of this Clause. Should new legislation or jurisprudence of a higher regional court (Oberlandesgericht) or the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (including, without limitation, based on proceedings initiated by the relevant Guarantor and/or its managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer)) be published and/or come into force after the date of this Indenture and should such law or court ruling lead to a different legal and/or factual assessment: (i) of the granting of the guarantee by the relevant Guarantor, the Trustee shall, upon the relevant Guarantor’s managing directors’ (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) request, enter into good faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent necessary to avoid the managing directors’ (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) personal liability resulting from the granting of the guarantee (taking into account the initial intention of the limitations set out in this Clause and, including but not limited to, amending reference points for the assessment whether or not a violation of sections 30, 31 GmbHG has occurred); or (ii) of the enforcement of the guarantee so that the limitations in this Clause are, are not, or only partially be, required to protect the managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representatives) of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability from the enforcement of the guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors shall, upon the Trustee’s request, enter into good faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent such provisions are, or are not required anymore to protect the managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability arising from the enforcement of the guarantee.’’ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Clause and any rights and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.’’ _AG Limitation Language_ As a general rule, Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) prohibits the disbursement of the deposits to the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenr¨uckgew¨ahr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) the relevant German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the acquisition of the stock in such German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Any agreement in such respect is void. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. In particular, STADA, which, together with the other Guarantors, provided a Senior Secured Notes Guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of 317 ----- the control date on March 20, 2018, is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). As all the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are direct or indirect subsidiaries of STADA, all limitations applicable to a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) (whether by virtue of law or contractual limitation language) will consequently also apply to such subsidiaries even if incorporated in a legal form other than a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior _Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.’’_ The limitation language for any public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents, in particular in the security documents, is substantially in the form as follows: (a) ‘‘Any guarantee or any liability, indemnity or other payment obligation (the ‘‘Guarantee’’) of a Guarantor which is a public limited liability company under German law (Aktiengesellschaft) (an ‘‘AG Guarantor’’) or by any Guarantor that is a subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall not be enforced to the extent such Guarantee secures or relates to liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of that AG Guarantor or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such subsidiaries not to include the AG Guarantor and the subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) if the relevant AG Guarantor is not party to a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder _Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) as the dominated party with a direct shareholder as the dominating party._ (b) If a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- _und/oder _Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) is in force between the relevant AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder_ (with the direct shareholder as dominating party) any Guarantee granted by such AG Guarantor or by any subsidiary of that AG Guarantor under this Agreement shall be enforceable except that it shall not be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent (i) the payment by the AG Guarantor or by a subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of those guarantees which secure liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of that AG Guarantor or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such subsidiaries not to include the AG Guarantor and the subsidiaries which are also subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) will, or must be expected to, result in an annual loss to that AG Guarantor and (ii) such annual loss would not be, or cannot be expected to be, compensated for by a compensation claim under the relevant domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/ _oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) that can be accounted for in the balance sheet of that AG Guarantor at_ full value (vollwertig), unless the mere existence of a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) between the relevant AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder (with the direct shareholder as dominating party) leads to the inapplicability of Section 57 sub section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in which case sub paragraphs (i) and (ii) shall not be applicable and which shall be deemed to be the case if so explicitly confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter dictum) by the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in a third party case. (c) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor shall not be limited to the extent any payment under the Guarantee demanded by a finance party from the relevant AG Guarantor is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs oder R¨uckgew¨ahranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the affiliate whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee and would therefore not lead to a violation of Section 57 sub section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), unless this exception would lead to a violation of Section 71a of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). (d) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor or of any subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are owed by that AG Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and (b) above. (e) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor or of any subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and (b) above in an amount equal to the amount drawn under the credit facilities (the ‘‘Drawn Amount’’) if and to the extent such Drawn Amount is applied for the repayment, prepayment or other refinancing of any financial indebtedness of such AG Guarantor or subsidiary of such AG Guarantor, provided that exception does not lead to a violation of Section 57 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). 318 ----- (f) The restrictions set out in paragraph (b) above do not affect the rights of the finance parties to claim any outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent paragraph (b) above would allow such claim at that later point. (g) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall no further apply from the date the AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) unless such Guarantor is a subsidiary of another AG Guarantor in which case paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall apply in a way that the Guarantor shall be treated as a subsidiary of that other AG Guarantor in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In such event, the limits set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply to the Guarantee granted by that Guarantor in respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.’’ Any guarantee, indemnity or upstream benefit granted under any Finance Document by STADA or any of its subsidiaries in respect of liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a Subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or indirect subsidiary of STADA) (cross stream) will in any case take effect not earlier than immediately after the occurrence of the Control Date (as defined under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’). (h) German terms in this Clause (including any reference to German statutory provisions) shall be construed in accordance with German law.’’ _General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_ German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to Sections 30, 31 and 64 sentence 3 GmbH and Sections 57, 71a and 92(2) sentence 3 the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Notes Guarantors to make payments on the Additional Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (i.e. the share pledges and any other security interest) provided by the German Notes Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding ‘‘destructive interference’’ (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Notes Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or any Senior Secured Notes Collateral by the German Notes Guarantors (including in the legal form of an AG). Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Additional Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. _Parallel Debt; Security Interests_ Under German law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not 319 ----- be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Additional Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Additional Notes or the holders of the Additional Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Additional Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the _Senior Secured Notes.’’_ German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). _Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the Restructuring Directive_ Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that debtor in possession proceedings have been ordered, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. On March 29, 2017, the German legislator passed an act for the improvement of legal certainty concerning clawback pursuant to the German Insolvency Code and the German Avoidance Act (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der _Insolvenzordnung und nach dem Anfechtungsgesetz), which entered into force on April 5, 2017 (subject to_ certain transitional provisions). The amendments to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz) concern, inter alia, the provisions on avoidance for intentionally disadvantaging third party creditors (Vorsatzanfechtung), cash transactions (Bargesch¨afte) and interest accruing on avoidance claims. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to us, which would be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Additional Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Additional Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or enforceability of the Additional Notes or any collateral in favor of the Additional Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Additional Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Additional Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under the Additional Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Additional Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Additional Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases, as recently amended by the act to improve legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under the German Insolvency Code 320 ----- and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach _der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz) which became effective on April 5, 2017:_ (a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; (b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors; (c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; (d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings; (e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, in which case such knowledge (solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing; (f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an a related party (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘related party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share 321 ----- capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; (g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and (h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder B¨urge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Notes Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words ‘‘imminent illiquidity’’ (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by ‘‘actual illiquidity’’ (eingetretene Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a ‘‘related party,’’ there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the above described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the ‘‘Restructuring Directive’’) has been adopted. The Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the 322 ----- European Union on June 26, 2019, and the member states have approximately two years to transpose the substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one year extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings. The Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

With effect from April 6, 2020, and as a result of legislative changes introduced in Finance Bill 2019-2020 to amend section 386 and Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act 1986 and section 129 and Schedule 3 of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016, and Article 346 and Schedule 4 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, HM Revenue and Customs (‘‘HMRC’’) will constitute a preferential creditor of an insolvent company in respect of certain amounts collected by the insolvent company on behalf of HMRC and will be treated accordingly in the event of a company’s insolvency. Searches made at the Registrar of Companies to ascertain what charges have been registered against the English Guarantors are not conclusive as to whether any security interests exist over any assets of the English Guarantors or the respective priorities of any security interests since (i) not all security interests created by a company are required to be registered at the Registrar of Companies and (ii) a charge may have been lodged with the Registrar of Companies, prior to the lodging of a security interest created by a company at the Registrar of Companies but may not yet have been processed and may not therefore appear on the company’s file. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.63,England and Wales,60.63.2,"Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges","The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed ‘‘out of court’’ (i.e., without the need for a court order) by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. Separately, the security document may state that it gives the secured creditor the right to appoint an administrative receiver. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which states that the relevant statutory provision (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act) applies to it or which purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company (or to make an appointment which would be the appointment of an administrative receiver). A creditor will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if it holds a floating charge or charges which relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the English Guarantors’ property or charges and other form of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the English Guarantors’ property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the English Guarantors’ assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time. The most relevant exemption from the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exemption relating to capital markets arrangements. This exemption provides that the appointment of an administrative receiver is permitted if it is to be made pursuant to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement under which a party incurs, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50,000,000 under the arrangement over its life and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment.’’ An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the English Guarantors would be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of realization of the English Guarantors’ assets subject to the floating charge for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full 325 ----- provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’). Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap, which was increased on April 6, 2020, of £800,000 (although the maximum aggregate cap will remain £600,000 where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to the creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Guarantors’ assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at the time. An administrator may dispose of or take any action in respect of any property of the English Guarantors subject to a floating charge as if it were not subject to the charge, although the floating charge holder shall have the same priority in respect of proceeds of the disposal. The administrator may also dispose of property which is the subject of a fixed charge, subject to making an application to court and the court finding that the disposal of the property would be likely to promote the purpose of the administration. Any court order will be subject to a condition that the net proceeds of disposal of the property, and any additional money required to be added to those net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court to be the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, be applied toward discharging the sums secured by the fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.63,England and Wales,60.63.3,Statutory Moratorium on Enforcement,"If the English Guarantors were to go into administration under English law, the rights of the Trustee or holders of the Senior Notes to institute any legal proceedings against the English Guarantors would be restricted. There is a general moratorium on the enforcement of security and other legal process when a company is in administration. No step may be taken by any person to enforce security over the property of a company in administration without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Furthermore, prior to the appointment of an administrator, an interim moratorium will automatically arise once an application to court to appoint an administrator has been lodged or notice of an intention to make an appointment out of court has been given. However, if an administrative receiver has already been appointed when the application for administration is made, the moratorium will only take effect when the person by or on behalf of whom the administrative receiver was appointed consents to the making of the administration order. Any previously appointed administrative receiver must vacate office upon an administration order taking effect. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to enforce their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a security financial collateral agreement. To the extent that the English Guarantors satisfy two or more of the requirements for being a ‘‘small company’’ under section 382 of the Companies Act 2006, they may also be eligible for a moratorium if implementing a company voluntary arrangement. Such a company will not, however, be eligible for such a moratorium if it falls within one of a number of exemptions. The most relevant exemption is that relating to capital markets arrangements. This exemption provides that a company is excluded from being eligible for a moratorium if, on the date of filing, it is a party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital markets arrangement under which a party has incurred, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £10,000,000 under the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital market investment.’’ The making of a winding up order or the appointment of a provisional liquidator in respect of the English Guarantors would have the effect of initiating a moratorium upon actions or proceedings against the English Guarantors, although the moratorium would not prevent the enforcement of security or a guarantee where this can be effected without the need for court intervention. If realizations from the enforcement of the security exceed the value of the amounts secured, the excess would be required to be paid over to the liquidator and would form part of the assets of the English Guarantors to be distributed by the liquidator. To the extent that the security realized does not cover the whole of the secured amount, the holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled to prove for the unsecured balance of those amounts alongside unsecured creditors. 326 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

An English Guarantor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and has a ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 50% or more by number and 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.63,England and Wales,60.63.5,Grounds for Challenge of Guarantees and Security,"There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English Guarantor of guarantees and security granted by an English company can be challenged. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to the guarantee of the English Guarantor and the security interests granted by an English company. _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of an English Guarantor could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest (in certain cases) or a guarantee granted by the English Guarantor (or give other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the transaction constitutes a gift or is made on terms that provide that the English Guarantor receives no consideration or if the English Guarantor receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or in money’s worth, than the consideration given by such English Guarantor. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act). In addition the English Guarantor must have been ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ at the time that it granted the guarantee or security or became ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as a result. An English Guarantor will be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ if a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the English Guarantor and remains unsatisfied for three weeks or an execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a court in favor of a creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the English Guarantor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the English Guarantor’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). A court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the English Guarantor entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the English Guarantor. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is 327 ----- for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a ‘‘connected person’’ (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption that the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate that the English Guarantor was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English Guarantor could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by such English Guarantor (or give other relief) on the grounds such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the English Guarantor) in a better position in the event of the English Guarantor’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court may not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the English Guarantor in deciding to give the preference was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith and for value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts and that the English Guarantor was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the English Guarantor was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of an English Guarantor, or a person who is a victim of the relevant transaction can apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or guarantee granted by that English Guarantor on the grounds the security interest or guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors. A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue and the court is satisfied the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against it or to prejudice the interest of such persons. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make such order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or protect the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the security interest or guarantees) but there is protection for a third party acting in good faith and for value without notice of the relevant circumstances. Any ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the English Guarantor is in liquidation or administration) may apply to court under this provision and not just liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the English Guarantor must enter insolvency proceedings and the relevant English Guarantor does not need to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction. _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if an English Guarantor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a liquidator or administrator if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986). The floating charge, however, will be validated to the extent of the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Guarantor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the floating charge is granted to a ‘‘connected person,’’ the charge can be challenged if given within two years of the onset of insolvency and the prerequisite to challenge that the English Guarantor is unable to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement,’’ the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. 328 ----- _Extortionate Credit Transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company up to three years before the day on which the English company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. _Priority of Claims_ One of the primary functions of administration and liquidation under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’ (see ‘‘—Administration, _Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges’’ above), distributions cannot be made to a class of_ creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): First ranking claims:_ holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets of the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; Second ranking claims:_ expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); Third ranking claims:_ preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. Secondary preferential debts are currently limited to certain categories of bank account deposits. The UK government has confirmed its intention in the Finance Bill 2020 that from December 1, 2020 secondary preferential debts will include claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention that these provisions will also apply to Northern Ireland; Fourth ranking claims:_ holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined above) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; Fifth ranking claims:_ unsecured creditors. - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration where consent has been given to make distributions. However, 329 ----- in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Senior Notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Senior Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however does not include ‘‘currency conversion’’ claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; Sixth ranking claims:_ connected/associated creditors. Creditors whose claims are subordinated to the payment of all of the insolvent company’s other creditors; and Seventh ranking claims:_ shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. _‘‘People with Significant Control’’ Regime_ Pursuant to Part 21A of the Companies Act 2006 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the Companies Act 2006), from April 6, 2016 certain UK incorporated companies, _societates europaeae and limited liability partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a relevant company) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the Companies Act 2006 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the Companies Act 2006. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the Companies Act 2006, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of the security interests over the security and the ability of the relevant secured parties to enforce their rights under or in respect of the English security documents. _Security Over Bank Accounts_ With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by an English company, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account Bank’’) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English company) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set off rights. _Assignments_ Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The 330 ----- first to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest. _Security Over Shares_ A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest. Security over shares granted by an English company or over shares of an English company are, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charger creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court. _Amendments_ An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The ‘‘official exchange rate’’ for these purposes is the middle market rate at the Bank of England as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines. Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantors go into liquidation or administration, holders of the Senior Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that the English Guarantors went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which holders of Senior Notes may become entitled.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

If that interest accrues under such documents and the security is provided as security for all amounts owing under those 331 ----- documents, the secured creditor will be entitled to satisfy its claim for any interest accrued up to the date of enforcement from the proceeds of enforcement of its security. If: (a) those proceeds of enforcement are insufficient to satisfy the secured creditor’s claim in full (including any accrued interest); or (b) the secured creditor elects to surrender its security and prove for its claim as an unsecured creditor in the debtor’s administration or liquidation, the secured creditor will be entitled to prove for any amounts that remain outstanding (including accrued interest) in accordance with the statutory regime, which applies to both administration and liquidation. The statutory regime provides that creditors may prove for interest accrued up to the date of administration or liquidation at the contractual rate. In the case of both administration and liquidation, if there is any surplus available after the payment of all debts proved, that surplus must be applied first towards the payment of interest on those proved debts in respect of the period after the debtor entered administration or liquidation. Such interest claims rank equally regardless of whether the debts to which they relate rank equally. Post administration or liquidation interest is payable at the higher of the rate specified in section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 on the date when the debtor entered administration or liquidation and the contractual rate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The United Kingdom, of which England forms a part, is a member of the European Union and, as such, the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings will apply to any insolvency proceedings affecting the English Guarantors. Pursuant to the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings, where a company incorporated under English law has its centre of main interests (‘‘COMI’’) in England, the English courts will have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company and any such proceedings will be recognized and have effect throughout the European Union. If an English Guarantor has its COMI in a member state of the European Union other than England and Wales, then the main insolvency proceedings for that English Guarantor may be opened in the member state in which its COMI is located and be subject to the laws of that member state. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. In that case, the English courts (or the courts of other parts of the United Kingdom) will only have jurisdiction to open secondary insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors if they are found to have an establishment in England and the effects of those proceedings will be limited to the assets of the English Guarantors located in England. The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross border Insolvency (the ‘‘Model Law’’) (which has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross border Insolvency Regulations 2006), provides for recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main or foreign non-main 323 ----- proceedings. English insolvency proceedings in relation to an English Guarantor may be recognized as foreign main proceedings in other jurisdictions which have implemented the Model Law if the English Guarantor has their respective COMI in England. If the English Guarantor is found to have its COMI in a place other than England, the English insolvency proceedings may only be afforded recognition as foreign non-main proceedings provided that the English Guarantor is found to have an establishment in England (meaning that it has a place of operations in England and carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). In that case, the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantor will occur in the place in which the English Guarantor is found to have its COMI. To the extent that the Cross border Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation of the United Kingdom under the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings, the requirements of the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings will prevail. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar and, in the event that any English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by a company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, a company or the holder of a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up a company or a company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Insolvency Act’’), a company is insolvent if it is ‘‘unable to pay its debts.’’ Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency Act, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts in certain circumstances, including, among others, the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for three weeks thereafter failed to pay, secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. The following description of the issues which may arise on an English insolvency is prepared on the assumption that the English Guarantors are subject only to one insolvency proceeding which is governed by English law and which has not been recognized in any other jurisdiction. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English company. Moreover, it remains to be seen what impact the UK vote to leave the European Union will have on the regulatory environment in the European Union and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law (including the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings) in the United Kingdom.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.64,The Netherlands,60.64.1,Dutch Insolvency Law,"One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated in The Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding concerning such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured nonpreferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which 332 ----- can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the _paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. 333 ----- Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below ‘‘—Fraudulent Transfer.’’ Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.64,The Netherlands,60.64.2,Limitations on Enforcement,"If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene _omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness_ (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled 334 ----- thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.64,The Netherlands,60.64.3,Parallel Debt,"Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Additional Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch share pledge will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch share pledge posed by Dutch law. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch share pledge is successfully challenged, holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch share pledge. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply _mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto. It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private 335 ----- limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register.

As the RoI Guarantor’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the relevant RoI Guarantor would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute ‘‘proof to the contrary’’ regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ((2004) 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); (2006) IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); (2006) Ch 508; ECJ Case C 341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that ‘‘factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties’’ would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption. If the RoI Guarantor’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead. RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the RoI Guarantors and any security interests granted by the RoI Guarantor. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of RoI insolvency laws relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and security interests in respect of the Additional Notes, insofar as they are provided by the RoI Guarantor. The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Additional Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive. The STADA Group has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in RoI which are commonly created in RoI over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee 336 ----- has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.65,Republic of Ireland,60.65.3,Preferred Creditors Under RoI Law,"Under Section 621 (Preferential Payments in a winding up) (‘‘Section 621’’) of the Companies Act 2014 (as amended, the ‘‘Companies Act’’) in a winding up of an RoI company certain preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from June 9, 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding up of that company, even if that floating charge has crystallized. Under Section 440 (Preferential Payments when receiver appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the RoI Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation. In addition, there is a further limited category of super preferential creditors which take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These super preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts, (see ‘‘—Examinership’’ below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE and VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created. Furthermore, and as referred to above (see ‘‘—Fixed and Floating Charges’’), in the case of the application of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a winding up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.65,Republic of Ireland,60.65.4,Examinership,"Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of the whole or part of an RoI company the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of an examiner and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement. In circumstances where an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one tenth of the paid up voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate its survival (and all or part of its undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the ROI company may be placed under the protection of the relevant Irish court (the ‘‘Court’’) for a period of time whilst its affairs are investigated by an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is capable of being rescued and to supervise the restructuring process. Where the Court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies Act to a related company of such company. Once confirmed by the Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members 337 ----- and creditors. During the protection period the day to day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the Court. Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme of arrangement will involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured, contingent and actual) that are in existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the company of new funds. The examiner has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. Having formulated his proposals, he must convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors as he thinks proper to consider acceptance of his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on the outcome of his meetings within 35 days of his appointment, although the 35 day period can be extended by the Court. There is acceptance by creditors or by a class of creditors when a majority in number representing a majority in value of the claims represented at the meeting vote in favor of the proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court if they are to become effective and the Court can confirm the proposals only if, inter alia: (a) at least one class of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals have accepted them; (b) the Court is satisfied that the proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors that has not accepted them and whose interests and claims would be impaired by implementation; and (c) they are not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party. Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may be, affected by the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified. For as long as a company is under the protection of the Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the consent of the examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors and others) of the Companies Act provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the examiner: - where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance or a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or income of the ROI company, no action may be taken to realize the whole or any part of such security; - no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the ROI company shall be appointed (and if a receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to act); and - no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for winding up of the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect). In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies Act, no payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of satisfaction or discharge of the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date upon which the petition for the examiner’s appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s report under Section 511 (Independent expert’s report) of the Companies Act that accompanied the petition recommended that all or part of that liability be discharged or satisfied, or such payment is authorized by the relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any interested party) where the relevant Irish court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part that liability would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as a going concern. Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending 70 days later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as the Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s final report). In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal. 338 ----- Furthermore, the Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed by the Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.65,Republic of Ireland,60.65.6,Challenges to Guarantees and Security,"There are circumstances under RoI insolvency law in which the granting by an RoI company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security or giving of the guarantee and, in addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when the security interest was granted or when the guarantee was given or ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ within the meaning of the Companies Act as a result. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees: _Unfair Preference_ Under Irish insolvency law, if an ROI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to have certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604 (Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the Companies Act (‘‘Section 604’’) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of any creditor of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within six months of the doing of the act and the company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to pay its debts (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). _Improperly Transferred Assets_ Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred) of the Companies Act (‘‘Section 608’’), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to ‘‘perpetrate a fraud’’ on the company, its creditors or members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have ‘‘use, control or possession’’ of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets has been extended to 339 ----- receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purposes of Section 604. _Disclaimer of Onerous Contracts_ Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the Companies Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the company. ‘‘Onerous property’’ is defined to include any ‘‘unprofitable contract’’ and ‘‘any other property (of the company) which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.’’ _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favor of a ‘‘connected person’’) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate. _General_ If the RoI Guarantor becomes subject to an RoI law insolvency proceeding and that company has obligations to creditors that are treated under RoI law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to the noteholders, the noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis that it is prohibited under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and unenforceable. Further, guarantees by the Irish guarantors for the obligations of another group company must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish guarantors. If the giving of a guarantee is not for the Irish guarantors’ corporate benefit, the guarantees could be held null and void. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case by case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross stream guarantees. The question whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantees could be declared null and void. The validity and/or enforceability of the guarantees may also be subject to the statutes of limitations, defenses such as set off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of estoppel, and the fact that equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion. Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the Companies Act (‘‘Section 82’’), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the Additional Notes may only be guaranteed by the relevant ROI company to the extent that it would not result in such guarantee constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82. Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book debts of an RoI tax resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding RoI tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners. 340 ----- The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of the RoI Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Northern Irish company should be commenced in Northern Ireland based on Northern Irish insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of Northern Irish companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of Northern Ireland may be initiated in a number of ways, including by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application to the High Court for administration, (ii) the company, its directors, or a qualifying floating chargeholder appointing administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor or the directors of the company filing a petition to wind up a Northern Irish company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation). A Northern Irish company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended), a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a ‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.66,Northern Ireland,60.66.3,Fixed Versus Floating Charges,"There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can (without the floating charge holder’s consent) convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, 341 ----- even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of a liquidator) properly incurred in a winding up are payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) there are particular challenges / risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and wages/ salaries (including holiday pay) owed to employees) and to ring fencing (see below ‘‘—Administration and _Floating Charges’’)._ Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.66,Northern Ireland,60.66.4,Administration and Floating Charges,"The Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended by the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 and as otherwise amended) empowers courts in Northern Ireland to make an administration order in respect of a Northern Irish company in certain circumstances. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the statutory purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge which has become enforceable. During the administration, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company in administration, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator (the statutory moratorium). Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. In England and Wales the statutory moratorium does not apply to security interests created or arising under a ‘‘financial collateral agreement’’ (generally, security/collateral in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the ‘‘2003 Regulations’’). The 2003 Regulations were implemented at a time when the Enterprise Act 2002 was in force in England and Wales; however the equivalent provisions in Northern Ireland were not introduced until the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 (the ‘‘2005 Order’’) came into force. The 2005 Order introduced Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and replaced Part III of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 which the 2003 Regulations had amended as far as financial collateral arrangements were concerned. Following this, the Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality and Financial Collateral Arrangements) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (the ‘‘2010 Regulations’’) reflected the changes brought about to the administration regime in Northern Ireland, as a consequence of the implementation of the 2005 Order. However, there appears to be one omission, which is the failure of the 2010 Regulations to disable the effect of Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, in relation to a receiver appointed pursuant to a financial collateral arrangement. Therefore, if a Northern Irish company were to enter administration, it is possible that the security or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or consent of the administrator. In addition, as stated above, Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the 342 ----- Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 has not been disapplied by the 2003 Regulations or the 2010 Regulations. Accordingly, there is a risk that any receiver appointed over an asset of a Northern Irish company under a financial collateral arrangement may be required to vacate office by an administrator of that entity if an administrator was appointed pursuant to the laws of Northern Ireland. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain this leave of court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed receiver must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed over that company’s fixed assets (commonly referred to as a fixed charge receiver) without the leave of a court of a competent jurisdiction in Northern Ireland (the ‘‘Northern Irish Court’’) or the administrator’s consent. In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Northern Irish obligor must constitute a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ for the purposes of Northern Irish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates March 27, 2006, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Article 5(1) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Northern Irish obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended), which will apply if a Northern Irish obligor creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realizations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant Northern Irish obligor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

This means that the NI Guarantor would be placed into either creditors’ voluntary liquidation or compulsory liquidation, both of which are insolvent liquidations. The NI Guarantor is not referring to the process of Members’ voluntary liquidation which is a solvent winding up and outside the scope of this analysis. On the liquidation of a Northern Irish company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing, amongst other things, the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests. Where the NI Guarantor is placed into creditors’ voluntary liquidation, there are no restrictions on the holder of security either by way of fixed or floating charge from taking steps to enforce those security interests unless the liquidator or any creditor has applied to a court for a stay. However, where the NI Guarantor is placed into compulsory liquidation, the consent of a Northern Irish Court is strictly required before any security interest can be enforced and a court order would be required to place the company into administration. In addition, with compulsory liquidation where the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are unsecured because of some inherent defect in the security interest, that guarantor cannot take action or commence proceedings to recover the amounts due on foot of the guarantee without the consent of a Northern Irish Court by virtue of Article 110(3) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). 343 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.66,Northern Ireland,60.66.6,Challenges to Guarantees and Security,"There are circumstances under Northern Irish insolvency law in which the granting by a Northern Irish company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the Northern Irish company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a Northern Irish company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Northern Irish law to guarantees and security interests: _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could apply to a Northern Irish Court for an Order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gift or transfer for no or significantly less consideration. There will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the Northern Irish company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989). The transaction is subject to potential challenge if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Northern Irish company grants the security interest or guarantee. However, a Northern Irish Court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot assure holders of the Additional Notes that in the event of insolvency, the granting of the security by the NI Guarantor would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support the analysis that (in any event) the guarantee was entered into in good faith for the purposes described above. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, a Northern Irish Court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the Northern Irish company in such proceedings to rebut such a presumption. _Preference_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could apply to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into, the Northern Irish company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) or the Northern Irish company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) as a consequence of its entry into the transaction. The transaction can be challenged if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the Northern Irish company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Northern Irish company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, a Northern Irish Court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (although there is protection for a third party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for a Northern Irish Court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Northern Irish company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In 344 ----- any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of a Northern Irish Court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit in the Northern Irish insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, a Northern Irish Court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Avoidance of Floating Charge_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, if a Northern Irish company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant Northern Irish company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. The requirement for the Northern Irish company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant Northern Irish company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant Northern Irish company is solvent or insolvent. The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant Northern Irish company grants the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security financial collateral agreement’’ under the 2003 Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.67,Belgium,60.67.1,Insolvency Proceedings,"To the extent any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is organized under the laws of Belgium (a ‘‘Belgian Guarantor’’), and provided Belgium is the territory in which the centre of such Belgian Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. The above also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the centre of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose centre of main 345 ----- interests is not situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction. Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/r´eorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX ‘‘Insolvency of enterprises’’ of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (the ‘‘Belgian Insolvency Act’’).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.67,Belgium,60.67.2,Judicial Reorganization,"A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed. As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve months as from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months. The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the ‘‘Belgian Financial Collateral Act’’), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. 346 ----- During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/m´ediateur d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium. The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15 day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. Such in court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it. In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with preexisting claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of 347 ----- such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The court ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to some limited exceptions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.67,Belgium,60.67.3,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/d´eclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de _paiements de mani`ere persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ ´ebranlement de cr´edit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to_ pay its debts as they fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not impair any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, in which case its claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors. The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy 348 ----- judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contract. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse). For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles: - _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so called ‘‘estate debts,’’ have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. - _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). - _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests. - _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank _pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.67,Belgium,60.67.4,COVID-19—Temporary Moratorium,"In the framework of the Covid-19 crisis, the Belgian federal government has introduced a statutory temporary moratorium (the ‘‘Moratorium’’) pursuant to the Royal Decree dated April 24, 2020. The Moratorium applies to any business whose continuity is threatened by the Covid-19 crisis and its consequence; provided that the business was not already in cessation of payments on or before March 18, 2020. Businesses automatically benefit from the Moratorium. However, an interested party (e.g. creditor or competitor) may challenge the Moratorium’s application if it considers that a business is not eligible for the Moratorium (as, for example, it was in cessation of payments before March 18, 2020 or is not impacted by the Covid-19 crisis). 349 ----- The Moratorium applies until and including May 17, 2020 or such later date as determined by a government decision. - During the Moratorium, businesses cannot be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Nor can a transfer of undertaking be forced upon a business. In addition, the obligation for a business to file for bankruptcy is suspended for the duration of the Moratorium if the bankruptcy conditions result from the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. - During the Moratorium, preventive and executory attachments cannot be levied or enforced in relation to certain assets (not including, among others, immovable property and financial collateral within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act). This protection against attachment covers debts predating and arising during the Moratorium. - The Moratorium is without prejudice to the principle that due debts should be paid. - Any (contractual) ground providing for the right unilaterally to dissolve an agreement on the grounds of non-payment of a monetary debt due and payable under the agreement is expressly suspended for the duration of the Moratorium. Express dissolution clauses that are triggered in the event of non-payment will as such not be enforceable. The Moratorium does not affect contractual remedies other than termination. Thus remedies such as the defense of non-performance, set-off and retention rights remain available throughout the Moratorium. - The Belgian Financial Collateral Act remains applicable during the Moratorium.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.67,Belgium,60.67.5,Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral,"The grant of a Guarantee or Senior Notes Collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group company must fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case by case basis by reference to the prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met. Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will be subject to only a ‘‘marginal review’’ by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as ‘‘abuse of company goods’’ (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.67,Belgium,60.67.7,Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer,"In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge certain transactions that have been concluded or performed by the debtor during the so called ‘‘hardening period.’’ In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the ‘‘hardening period’’ (verdachte periode/p´eriode suspecte). The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) security interests provided for preexisting debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings). Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment. In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure preexisting debts. If the guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests. Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana). Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the date of registration.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

See ‘‘Notice to Certain Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The Senior Secured Notes Indenture has not been qualified under, and does not incorporate by reference or include, nor is it subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders are not entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us. The terms of the New Notes include those set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer previously issued (i) A735.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘Original Senior Secured Notes’’) on September 29, 2017 (the ‘‘Original Issue Date’’), (ii) A350,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes on February 13, 2020 and (iii) A600,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes on March 3, 2020 ((i) through (iii), collectively, the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured Notes’’).

However, the New Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will be issued with separate ISINs and common codes from those assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations— _No Fungibility with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes.’’_ The Senior Secured Notes Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be issued in connection with this Offering.

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES Germany,25.1.1,,"The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. Our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. Virtually all of our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture governing the Additional Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist: - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtsh¨angig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment; - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Additional Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (verm¨ogensrechtliche Anspr¨uche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. 358 ----- German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law); - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention member state of the European Union or a Member State which the English Court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of Court Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007; 359 ----- - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the courts of The Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction vis `a vis the Dutch Guarantor on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in The Netherlands. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

A judgment of the courts of the State of New York will be enforced by the courts of the RoI if the following general requirements are met: (i) the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to the Republic of Ireland conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending. Where however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in the Republic of Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive. 360 ----- However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons: (iii) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money; (iv) if the judgment was obtained by fraud; (v) the enforcement of the judgment in the Republic of Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice; (vi) the judgment is contrary to the Republic of Ireland public policy or involves certain United States laws which will not be enforced in the Republic of Ireland; or (vii) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in the Republic of Ireland or outside the Republic of Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules. Pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of November 22, 1996, as amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 (the ‘‘Blocking Statute’’), no judgment of a court or tribunal and no decision of an administrative authority located outside of the European Union giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex to the Blocking Statute or to actions based thereon will be recognized or be enforceable in any manner by the courts of the Republic of Ireland.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if: - the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law). - Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that: - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in Northern Ireland; - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained); - the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of a final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in Northern Ireland; - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were breached; - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit); or 361 ----- - an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S. court.

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be produced in court by the claimant: - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/exp´edition de la d´ecision) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law; - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law; and - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant. However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if: - the rights of defense have been violated; - such recognition or enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state; - the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable laws; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian private international law; - the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter; - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium; - Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

The sale of the Additional Notes will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering memorandum (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’). The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Additional Notes from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Additional Notes if they purchase any of the Additional Notes. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Additional Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Additional Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Additional Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Additional Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Persons who purchase the Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of Additional Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated. Certain of the Sponsors or their affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Additional Notes at a purchase price per Additional Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, subject to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount in respect of the Additional Notes purchased by such persons. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Additional Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Additional Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Additional Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and the resale of the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Transfer _Restrictions.’’_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Additional Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will apply, through their listing agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Additional Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘Exchange Act’’). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Additional Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the _Senior Secured Notes—Transfer of the Additional Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Additional Notes.’’_ Under Rule 15c6 1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the Exchange Act) unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the A200.0 aggregate amount of the Additional Notes will be made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business days following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + ‘‘). Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Additional Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Additional Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids 356 ----- permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Additional Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Additional Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Additional Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Additional Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and may impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Additional Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating _to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer of the Additional Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Additional Notes.’’_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Additional Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Additional Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Additional Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Additional Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Additional Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Additional Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. 357 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial Statements. The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement. The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or non-current distinction. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the Notes are shown in euro thousands (k A).

Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations,29.37.1,,"In financial year 2019, Nidda observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to pronouncements published by the IASB and adopted by the EU which were first applicable as of January 1, 2019. The following changes had effects on the presentation of Nidda’s net assets, financial position and results of operations and cash flow: In January 2016, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’, which determines the recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (liabilities) associated with leases in the balance sheet for lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. STADA applied the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and was modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures was waived. In this context, the rights of use were equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change. The amortized cost of the right of use is calculated as the present value of future lease payments, initial direct costs as well as the estimated costs that would arise in the course of the disassembly and removal or restoration of the leasing object. Leasing incentives received are deducted. Use is made of the option to consider non-leasing components generally as leasing payments. First-time application of the leasing liabilities is carried out at the amortized cost of the lease liability to be paid. In subsequent measurement, the leasing liabilities are compounded and reduced by the leasing payments made. Liabilities from finance leases, which were already recognised under IAS 17, were not revalued at the date of first-time application F-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.38,Notes (Continued) 3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued),29.38.1,,"of IFRS 16 and were therefore carried at their corresponding carrying amount (A5.3 million) as of January 1, 2019. Use is made of the option granted by IFRS 16 to waive application of a right of use and the leasing liability for (short-term) leases with a term of up to twelve months or for leases of low-value assets. The option of grandfathering was not used. Consequently, IFRS 16 was applied on January 1, 2019 to all existing contracts that fall within its scope. In the transition to IFRS 16, current findings in the determination of the terms of leases with extension and termination options have been incorporated. For the measurement of the right of use, the initial direct costs at the time of initial application were not taken into account. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet, as required by IFRS 16, a significant increase in the balance sheet total in the amount of A59.0 million and a corresponding increase in current and non-current leasing liabilities occurred which are reported in the balance sheet item other financial liabilities. The difference between the other financial obligations from leases as of December 31, 2018 in the amount of A43.9 million, which were discounted at the incremental borrowing rate, and the leasing liabilities reported in the balance sheet at the time of the initial application of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, results primarily through the evaluation to be made in accordance with IFRS 16 on the exercise of termination and extension options as well as the evaluation on January 1, 2019 of leases that are to be identified and, consequently, to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16. Instead of leasing expenses for operating leases, as a result of the changes from IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding impact on the EBITDA. Depreciation and amortization for these leasing contracts amounted to A23.9 million in financial year 2019. In addition, there were reported interest expenses in the amount of A3.3 million in the reporting period. In financial year 2018, In accordance with the requirements of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’ that were to be applied in the previous year, these expenses were fully recognized in operating profit as a leasing expense and as a reduction of EBITDA. In addition, there were payments in connection with leases in accordance with IFRS 16 amounting to A26.3 million, which are now fully reflected in the cash flow from financing activities. The changeover effect relates at STADA for the most part to leased real estate and company vehicles.

Control exists if Nidda German Topco GmbH or its subsidiaries are in control of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of voting rights of more than 50%. Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method. Associates are companies over which Nidda German Topco GmbH can have significant direct or indirect influence and are not subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method. Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Nidda Group is insignificant, are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for at amortized cost under financial assets.

After critical examination of the premises underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary. The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized through other coprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, because it is a transaction between the equity investors. Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized. Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests. If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an associate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Currency translation,29.68.1,,"The functional currency of Nidda German Topco GmbH is the euro and corresponds to the reporting currency of the Group. In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at the time of the transactions. On every balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing rate and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses. The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the Consolidated Financial Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the period.

During the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested.

Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corre sponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost. Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty method. At Nidda, this affects the capitalized umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco, and the capitalized umbrella brand Vannier. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives at the level of the individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the level of the individual companies that generate sales under the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist. Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years).",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied due to a lack of relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing costs are not capitalized.

Financial assets are accounted for and measured in accordance with IFRS 9. This involves classifying a financial asset on the basis of its contractual cash flow characteristics and business model. Under IFRS 9, a financial asset is carried at cost if the underlying business model is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (business model condition). In addition, the cash flow condition must be satisfied. This is the case when the contractual features of the financial asset at specified times only provide for interest and principal payments on the outstanding principal amount. Receivables eligible for factoring are included in trade accounts receivable. Based on the present business model, they are measured at fair value recorded directly in equity. Changes in the fair value of these receivables are therefore recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets measured at fair value recorded directly in equity are generally subject to the same impairment model as financial assets measured at amortized cost. In accordance with IFRS 9, expected losses are accounted for on the basis of the expected credit loss model. The simplified approach is applied for trade accounts receivable.

To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account. The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of expenses. F-22 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Accounting policies (Continued) Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly,29.98.1,,"attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values. These financial liabilities are reported in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item. Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging instruments are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the fair value change of the hedged underlying transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in addition to the fair value change in the derivative, the opposing fair value change in the underlying transaction is recognized in profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the hedged risk. No use is made of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Excepted from this are short-term leases with a maximum term of twelve months as well as leases for low-value assets with a value of below A5,000. Here, Nidda applies the option to recognize such leases as expenses at the time of the lease payment. Upon initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the outstanding lease payments, discounted at the interest rate underlying the lease. If the interest rate underlying the lease cannot be determined, a marginal debt rate is used. Nidda also makes use of the lease provision not to separate non-lease components from lease components and recognizes corresponding leases as a single agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles",29.100.1,,"The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, Nidda makes estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed below. As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions. Nidda carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from ‘‘Corporate Assets’’ to the carrying amounts of the respective cash-generating units and an allocation from ‘‘Corporate Costs’’ are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on the basis of individual appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined in the context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years. For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, F-23 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)",29.101.1,,"estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future. Nidda makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries. Nidda operates in various countries and must pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the Nidda Group is being allotted to a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. If it is probable that amounts recognized in the tax returns cannot be realized, tax liabilities are recognized which are measured at the most probable amount or the expected value. When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date. The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds. The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. Provisions are created if there is a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on estimates of the prospects of success of these methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of probable sales. F-24 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The reduction in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets compared with the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization of intangible assets with purchase price allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as from impairments on such assets. In total, deferred tax liabilities decreased to A923.2 million as of December 31, 2019 (previous year: A971.5 million). This development was mainly attributable to the previously described reduction in temporary differences from intangible assets and lower taxable differences from liabilities. The decrease in loss carryforwards resulted in particular from the use of tax-loss carryforwards. Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under ‘‘Deferred taxes from loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable.

Intangible assets (Continued),29.151.1,,"As of December 31, 2019, the Hemofarm umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A39.7 million (previous year: A39.5 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2019, a royalty rate of 2% and, as in the previous year a discount rate of 12.9% (previous year: 13.7%) were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year. The change compared to the previous year figure of A0.2 million is attributable to different exchange rates. As of December 31, 2019, the Pymepharco umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A9.2 million (previous year: A8.8 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2019, a royalty rate of 2% and, as in the previous year, a discount rate of 13.7% (previous year: 14.3%) were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year. The change is a result of different exchange rates. The umbrella brand Laboratorio Vannier remained completely written off and has a carrying amount of A0.0 million (previous year: A0.0 million). The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of A14.3 million (previous year: A15.2 million) as of December 31, 2019, will be amortized as scheduled over its useful life. This was countered by an increase in the carrying amount in the current financial year as a result of the exchange rate development of the Russian ruble. Borrowing costs capitalized in 2019 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the production of a qualifying asset amounted to A3.7 million (previous year: A2.6 million). In financial year 2019, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was 3.0% (previous year: 2.5%). Development costs of A25.0 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A23.7 million). Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly allocatable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). Development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are recognized immediately as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. In financial year 2019, these development costs amounted to of A72.8 million (previous year: A72.3 million). Scheduled amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an amount of A278.9 million (previous year: A267.7 million). In financial year 2019, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of A101.2 million (previous year: A85.6 million). These impairments resulted primarily from the year-end impairment tests. No valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year. Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation (see Note 5.).

Such a detailed planning period reflects the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed plan ning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year, for the period after the three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for determining values in use is based on certain assumptions that are based on past experience, complemented by internal developments, and verified based on external market data and analyses. Key assumptions include the development of future selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. Significant changes to the aforementioned assumptions would influence the determination of the values in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates used are determined based on external factors derived from the market and are adjusted for the risks predominant in the cash-generating units in question. Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the cash-generating units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no necessity for an impairment to any cash-generating unit. For the regular impairment test in the previous year, there was a headroom in the low triple-digit million range. Changes to the valuation parameters for the impairment test can influence the value in use of the cash-generating unit. A sensitivity analysis was therefore conducted for the cash-generating unit by using a 1.0 percentage point increase of the discount rate, a 0.5 percentage point reduction of the growth rate, and a 10.0 percentage point reduction of the EBIT. Based on these assumptions, there was a need for impairment in the amount of:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Other non-current provisions (Continued),29.215.1,,"The plan assets, which have a quoted market price, consist of the following: employee and employer contributions. In addition, there were other special events with an insignificant impact on the balance sheet. The fair value of plan assets underlying the pension obligations developed as follows for German group companies: The net liability for international Group companies from defined benefit pension plans developed as follows: The amount of the income from plan assets for German Group companies is largely determined by raising the value of the plan assets of a commitment to the value of the gross obligation on the basis of the reinsurance available for this purpose. This decreased as a result of the significantly lower discount rate in the financial year 2019 and thus had an increasing effect on income. The reduction in the income from plan assets abroad is mainly due to a positive performance of plan assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland as well as an increase in the income from plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the amount of plan assets is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation and is therefore crucially dependent on the development of the discount rate. In financial year 2019, the actuarial interest rate fell. This led to an increase in the obligation and the plan assets and thus the income. As a result of the switch of the pension plan to a solely contribution-funded solution as of the end of this financial year, this effect occurs for the last time. The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and pension costs: In the following, the change in the defined benefit obligations (DBO) for international Group companies is presented according to a change in the discount rate, salary trends and pension trends: amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future. In the United Kingdom, employees are provided with defined benefit plans that are concluded for new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension plans are subject to the United Kingdom Trust Law and the United Kingdom Pension Regulator. The pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations. As of December 31, 2019, plan assets amounted to A26.0 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table CMI 2018 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are no longer relevant for the pension plan. In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. The Group’s Swiss benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In the Netherlands, the pension plan as of the end of the financial year 2019 was switched to a contribution-based solution. All entitlements are fully guaranteed in terms of insurance, so that no provisions will be formed from 2019. Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist.

For the Group, pension plans in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 80%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these countries. In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension plans. Furthermore, regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In addition, there is a pre-retirement regulation for selected employees. In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a pension fund. As of December 31, 2019, plan assets amounted to A46.7 million and were composed of three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans. In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany, as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally. Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development. The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the STADA Arzneimittel AG Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff was transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan F-50 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The provision of these collateral securities meant that the holders of the STADA A300,000,000 1.75% bonds with maturity in 2022 had the right to redeem the nominal amount and accrued interest under the STADA bonds.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the proceeds from disposals. This amounted to A�265.0 million in the reporting year (previous year: A�300.3 million). In financial year 2019, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets amounted to A161.7 million (previous year: A280.3 million). Of this amount, A135.1 million (previous year: A255.4 million) was attributable to payments for significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio which, with A84.2 million, primarily related to the acquisition of a branded products portfolio in the United Kingdom. Within the scope of business combinations, there were net payments from the acquisition of the Biopharma Group in the amount of A47.5 million. Payments received from the disposal of assets amounted to A31.5 million in the reporting year (previous year: A9.2 million).

This development is primarily attributable to the following effects: In the fourth quarter of 2019, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued a bond (‘‘second SSN bond’’) with a carrying amount of A600.7 million for the financing of the Takeda acqui- sition, the conclusion of which was carried out in the first quarter of 2020. The associated amounts were held in an escrow account as of the balance sheet date, as these funds are specifically intended for the execution of this transaction. Presen- tation of the retention on this escrow account is also carried out in cash flow from financing activities. The assumption of financial liabilities includes an amount of A11.7 million which relates for the most part to transactions in connection with the issue of the bond which is accrued in other financial liabilities. Furthermore, the scheduled repayment of promissory note loans of STADA Arzneimittel AG were recorded. In addition, cash flow from financing activities was influenced by the repayment of financial liabilities from leases which now also include the leases identified within the scope of the new standard IFRS 16 which was applied for the first time as of January 1, 2019. The cash flow from financing activities in the previous year was impacted by the following effects: In the previous year, in order to finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG publicly tendered as part of the purchase offer, the Second SUN Bond with a volume of A250.0 million was issued by Nidda BondCo GmbH on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018. In addition, Nidda Healthcare GmbH received an additional loan under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility D’’). Conversely, cash flow from financing activities including payments of A1,447.0 million were made in 2018 in connection with the delisting tender offer as a change in minority interests. Furthermore, in the second quarter of 2018, a bond issued by STADA Arzneimittel AG in the amount of A347.1 million took place and was repayed according to schedule. Payments for dividend distributions amounted to A17.0 million related entirely to dividends paid to the non-controlling shareholders within the STADA Group. Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities amounted to A43.7 million in financial year 2019 (previous year: A�68.9 million).

Had this calculation logic already been used as of December 31, 2018, contingent liabilities in the amount of A50.8 million would have been reported (instead of A31.0 million which was published as of December 31, 2018). The possible obligations amounted to approx. A58.8 million (previous year: A50.8 million). The increase of A8.0 million as compared to the previous year is based primarily on possible obligations from legal disputes.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables and of financial investments held until maturity with a remaining term of less than one year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expecta- tions. Trade accounts payable as well as remaining financial liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair values. The chart below shows how the valuation rates of financial instruments measured at fair value were determined for the respective valuation categories of financial instruments: changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective. Due to an individual circumstance, the underlying transactions for currency forwards with a nominal value of A4.4 million maturing on February 6, 2020 have ceased to exist in the short term. These currency forwards, which are located in other financial liabilities, all have a negative market value of A0.2 million, which is recognized under other expenses.

Newly included in this category are the shares acquired in the reporting period from the Swedish company XBrane.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, the allocation to the respective hierarchy levels is reviewed according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If a need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy levels. The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose, market comparisons and change analyses are carried out. Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include, as in the previous year, positive or negative market values of derivative financial instruments (currency swaps and interest rate swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards are determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties. In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/DKK, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD, EUR/AUD and EUR/GBP) are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from intercompany loans with companies that keep their accounting in a local currency other than euros.

However, the Group is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency risks through, alongside natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, use was made of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures contracts are adjusted to the term of the underlying transactions. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year. In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro (translation risk).

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group F-81 ----- management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations,103.27.1,,"In financial year 2018, Nidda observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to pronouncements published by the IASB and adopted by the EU which were first applicable as of January 1, 2018. The following changes had effects on the presentation of Nidda’s net assets, financial position and results of operations and cash flow: In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. The standard replaces IAS 39 and introduces new rules for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments. Furthermore, IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Nidda applied the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018, pursuant to the transitional regulations of IFRS 9, an adjustment of the previous year’s figures is waived. Accordingly, the cumulative effect from initial application of IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018 was recognized in equity with no effect on profit or loss. IFRS 9 introduces a new model for classifying financial assets. They are classified according to their contractual cash flow properties and business model within the context of which they are held. Financial instruments in the category ‘‘measured at amortized cost’’ (AC) are classified into the new category ‘‘fair value through other comprehensive income’’ (FVOCI) or ‘‘fair value through profit or loss’’ (FVPL) in the result. F-89 ----- In financial year 2018, STADA observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which were first applicable as of January 1, 2018. Insofar as these changes have material effects on the presentation of STADA’s net assets, financial position and results of operations or cash flows, these are described in detail below: In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. The standard replaces IAS 39 and introduces new rules for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments. Furthermore, IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. STADA applied the new standard for the first time on January 1, 2018. There will be no adjustment of the previous year’s figures pursuant to the transitional provisions of IFRS 9. Accordingly, the accumulative effect from the initial application of IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018, was recorded in equity with no effect on profit or loss. IFRS 9 has introduced a new model for the classification of financial assets. For debt instruments, these are classified based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they are held. As a consequence, financial instruments of the category ‘‘measured at amortized cost’’ (AC) are reclassified to the category ‘‘measured at fair value through other comprehensive income’’ (FVOCI) or to the category ‘‘measured at fair value through profit or loss’’ (FVPL).

476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.28,Notes (Continued) 3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued),103.28.1,,"For the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities, initial application of IFRS 9 has had the following impacts: In accordance with IFRS 9, equity instruments in general and derivatives are always measured at fair value through profit or loss. For equity instruments, IFRS 9 offers the choice to record changes in fair value under other comprehensive income. Nidda has not made use of this option to date. Due to the new regulations on impairment, expected losses will in future be recognized as expenses earlier in accordance with IFRS 9. While the incurred losses model was essential to create a risk provision pursuant to IAS 39, this is based on the expected credit losses model pursuant to IFRS 9. In this context, Nidda applied the simplified approach for trade accounts receivable. The general approach is normally applied for other financial assets. Impairments increased by A2.7 million as a result of the first-time application of the impairment regulations pursuant to IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018. Reconciling the risk provision pursuant to IAS 39 to the expected credit losses (ECL) pursuant to IFRS 9 is shown below: Furthermore, down-payments received led to reclassifications from trade accounts payable to contractual liabilities in the amount of A0.6 million. The new standard on revenue recognition thus had little impact on sales accounting, as sales are largely realized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of routine transactions. There are no agreements in the Group which regulate multiple services within one contract or within several contracts (multi-element arrangements). There were no changes in the accounting of licensing agreements, which amounted to less than 2% of the total sales revenue in financial year 2017. All license agreements of STADA are either bound to the achieved sales of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. If this were not the case for such license agreements, the result, due to the new IFRS 15 standard, future sales would be realized in the amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore no longer, as they are presently, divided over the term of the license. The effects on STADA’s consolidated balance sheet as a result of the first-time application of the new IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards as at January 1, 2018 are shown below: Furthermore, in May 2017, IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’’ was issued by the IASB, through which a clarification of the requirements of the approach and measurement of uncertain earnings positions arose. According to this, a company within the scope of the assessment of the uncertainty must estimate how probable the acceptance of the tax treatment of business transactions in the respective tax jurisdictions is. The interpretation is to be applied for financial years which begin on or after January 1, 2019, whereby earlier application is permitted. Nidda currently finds itself in the evaluation on the impact of IFRIC 23 on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In addition, a cash flow condition must be met. This is the case if the contractual technical characteristics of the financial asset only provide for interest payments and repayments on the outstanding capital amount at defined points in time. The new regulations for the classification of financial assets lead to changes for the receivables that can be factored in terms of their measurement and presentation as a result of this business model. Financial assets that are still included in trade accounts receivable are now no longer measured at amortized cost but through other comprehensive income at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these receivables will therefore in future be recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are therefore generally subject to the same impairment model as financial assets valued at amortized cost. Equity instruments and derivatives must generally be measured at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to IFRS 9. F-90 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Nidda applied the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018. In this regard, Nidda made use of its right to choose the simplified initial application. Accordingly, the contracts that were not fully completed as of January 1, 2018, are accounted for as if the new standard IFRS 15 was already applied when these contracts began so that the cumulative effect from the change is recognized directly in equity. There is no adjustment of the comparable figures from the prior-year period. An increasing accumulative effect in the amount of A0.3 million was recognized in retained earnings including net income from the first-time application of IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018. The effect resulted primarily from the to be accounted contractual assets which in future are to be shown within the scope of return regulations and the deferred taxes to be established as a result.

Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. Nidda will apply the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and thereby likely modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures will be waived. In this context, the rights of use will likely be equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change. An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements has not yet been fully completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet, as required by IFRS 16, an increase in the balance sheet total is expected at the point of initial application. In accordance with the currently existing leasing agreements and the currently available investigation results, an accounting of use of rights in the amount of approximately A40 million as well as recognition of leasing obligations in the total amount of A40 million is expected. Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of amendments to IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on the EBITDA. Nidda, pursuant to the current status of the investigation, assumes that the depreciation of the currently existing leasing agreements will in future amount to approximately A40 million. In addition, Nidda expects future interest expenses in the amount of approximately A10 million. In accordance with the previous requirements of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’, these expenses would have been fully recognized in operating profit as a leasing expense and as a reduction of EBITDA. The changeover effect relates for the most part to leased real estate, company vehicles as well as office and business equipment. F-93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

On expiration of the acceptance period, a total of 63.77% of the issued STADA shares had been submitted for sale, so that the minimum acceptance threshold was reached. The fulfillment date of the resulting purchase contracts, as a result of which the Nidda Healthcare Holding AG (now operating as a GmbH) received ownership of these shares, was August 22, 2017 which is therefore to be regarded as the date of acquisition.

Business combinations (Continued),103.75.1,,"Holding AG (now operating as GmbH) acquired ownership of these additional STADA shares. Between August 21 and August 23, 2017, Nidda Healthcare Holding AG (now operating as GmbH) acquired further STADA shares via the Frankfurt stock exchange (XETRA�). Given the immediate continuity of the extended acceptance period and the temporal proximity of the acquisitions via the stock exchange to the acquisition date, these share acquisitions were included in the acquisition costs of A2,704.7 million. The transaction costs amounted to A90.0 million. In terms of the financing of the acquisition of the STADA Arzneimittel AG, the Nidda Group first utilized equity commitments provided by the sponsors, a syndicated loan agreement and two bridge loans. The equity commitments of the sponsors were contributed indirectly via intermediate holding companies to the Nidda German Topco GmbH, partly by way of a capital contribution and additional payments into the capital reserve and partly by way of shareholder loans and similar instruments. The syndicated loan agreement was concluded on August 17, 2017 and grants a secured loan (‘‘Term Loan’’) callable in several tranches and currencies in a total nominal amount of initially up to A1,700.0 million and a secured revolving credit facility of up to A400.0 million (‘‘RCF’’). The bridge loans, also concluded on August 17, 2017, consisted of a secured syndicated loan with a nominal value of A485.0 million (‘‘SSN Bridge’’) and a partially secured syndicated loan with a nominal value of A340.0 million (‘‘SUN Bridge’’). The acquisition of the shares of the STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the takeover bid was then financed, in addition to the equity commitments, by drawdowns of Term Loan in the amount of A250.0 million, of the RCF in the amount of A37 million and the complete drawdown of both bridge loans. On September 29, 2017, the bridge loans were refinanced as planned by long-term bonds. For this purpose, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued a bond with a volume of A735.0 million and an interest rate of 3.5% p.a. (‘‘SSN Bond’’). In parallel, Nidda Bondco GmbH issued a bond with a volume of A340.0 million and an interest rate of 5% p.a. (‘‘First SUN Bond’’). The net proceeds of the bond issues were used for the full repayment of the bridge loans and for an allocation to a special account for the future acquisition of additional STADA shares, refinancing of existing debt financing of the Group and other purposes permitted under the syndicated loan agreement. The STADA Group was included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH for the first time as of August 31, 2017. In the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017, the purchase price allocation was considered on a provisional basis. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the interim and was included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2018 accordingly. The adjustments required as a result of the finalization also had an impact on the data of the financial statements as disclosed in these Consolidated Financial Statements for the comparative period 2017. This explains the deviations of comparative figures in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2018 financial year with information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared as of December 31, 2017. F-101 ----- The adjustments associated with the finalization of the purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2017 are as follows: and liabilities in the amount of A171.3 million, with a corresponding effect (reduction) on goodwill that arose from the provisional purchase price allocation. In order to partially finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered in the course of the de-listing offer, Nidda BondCo GmbH issued a bond with a total volume of A250.0 million and an interest rate of 7.25% p.a. on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018 (‘‘Second SUN Bond’’).

Compared to the preliminary purchase price allocation in the financial year 2017, the final purchase price allocation had a positive effect on earnings before taxes in the amount of A47.2 million. This effect was mainly due to the reduced burden in the cost of sales in the amount of A17.0 million, due to reduced impairments on receivables and intangible assets in the amount of A18.3 million in other operating expenses as well as reduced charges in the recognition of provisions and other liabilities in the amount of A7.9 million. The cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities has not changed between the final and the preliminary purchase price allocation. Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used to measure the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Sales generated by the STADA Group amounted to around A2,330.8 million in financial year 2018. The result after taxes of this business combination amounted to around A310.5 million in the reporting year.

The company manufactures the active ingredient Erythropoietin and markets it in particular by issuing sales licenses to STADAPHARM and other third parties. BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which was previously included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as an associate, and its subsidiary NorBiTec GmbH have been included as subsidiaries in consideration of minority interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements, with effect as of September 30, 2018. Control was obtained as a result of acquiring an additional 35.48% of the shares from co-shareholders, whereby STADA, together with the shares it already held, holds 51.34% of the shares in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and is therefore the company’s majority shareholder. The purchase price for the acquisition of A35.0 million was fully paid in cash. The acquisition took place on September 27, 2018, following approval of the purchase agreement concluded in August 2018 by the competition authorities. The final purchase price allocation led to substantial changes in comparison to the reported preliminary purchase price allocation reported as of September 30, 2018. These were attributable primarily to the valuation of immaterial assets.

Based on the negative goodwill determined as part of the purchase price allocation, the procedures used to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed were reviewed again. In this context, it was ensured that all information available at the time of acquisition was adequately taken into account in the valuation. The share relating to non-controlling shareholders in the acquired company determined at the time of acquisition as part of the purchase price allocation is A74.2 million.

Accounting policies (Continued) Sales are recognized when the control over delimitable goods passes to the customer, meaning that the",103.98.1,,"customer is able to determine the use of the delimitable goods and, essentially, derive benefit from them. As a requirement for this, there must be an agreement with enforceable rights and obligations and, inter alia, a consideration must be highly likely. The creditworthiness of the customer must be considered in this instance. The amount of sales is based on the transaction price to which Nidda is expected to be entitled. Variable considerations that are only considered if it is highly likely that this will not lead to a significant reversal of sales should there no longer be any uncertainty regarding the variable consideration, have an influence on the expected transaction price. The amount of the variable consideration is therefore determined using the expected value method. Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective contract in force. All license agreements of Nidda are either bound to the realized sales of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. The realization of sales is thus distributed over the periods of the contractual term. Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period.

Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)",103.113.1,,"For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future. Nidda makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries. Nidda operates in various countries and must pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the Nidda Group is being allotted to a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date. The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds. The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. Provisions are created if there is a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on estimates of the prospects of success of these methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual F-110 ----- expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements.

The nominal income tax rate for financial year 2018 for Nidda German Topco GmbH in Germany amounted to 28.32% (previous year: 31.9%), including corporate tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the solidarity surcharge in the amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 357% (previous year: 460%). No deferred tax liabilities were formed for temporary differences from undistributed earnings from subsidiaries in the amount of A22.4 million (previous year: A17.6 million), because these profits will be reinvested for an indefinite period. The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes.

In addition, the increase in the number of employees as of the balance sheet date was due to the expansion of the marketing and sales division of the German subsidiary STADAPHARM GmbH and the Spanish subsidiary Laboratorio STADA S.L.

In the Group, the umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco and Laboratorio Vannier are included as recognized trademarks as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, as it is intended to make continuing use of them. As of December 31, 2018, these umbrella brands have a carrying amount of A51.6 million (STADA), A39.5 million (Hemofarm) and A8.8 million (Pymepharco). In the context of the impairment test as at December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 1.5% was used for the umbrella brand STADA. The royalty rate for Hemofarm and Pymepharco was 2%. The discount rate was 7.5% (STADA), 13.7% (Hemofarm) and 14.3% (Pymepharco). There was no necessity for impairment in the reporting year. The impairment test with a license rate of 2% and a discount rate of 17.8% for the umbrella brand Laboratorio Vannier resulted in an impairment charge of A0.2 million for the reporting year. As of December 31, 2018, the umbrella brand was thus completely written off and has a carrying amount of A0.0 million. The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of A15.2 million as of December 31, 2018, will be amortized as scheduled over its useful life. F-119 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Intangible assets (Continued),103.160.1,,"Borrowing costs capitalized in 2018 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the production of a qualifying asset amounted to A2.6 million (previous year: A0.5 million). In financial year 2018, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was 2.5% (previous year: 1.6%). Development costs of A23.7 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A8.6 million). Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). Development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are recognized immediately as expense in the period in which they are incurred. In financial year 2018, these development costs amounted to of A72.3 million (previous year: A23.1 million). Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an amount of A267.7 million (previous year: A88.7 million). In financial year 2018, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of A85.6 million (previous year: A11.9 million). These impairments resulted primarily from the year-end impairment tests. No valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year. Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation (see Note 5.). F-120 ----- Intangible assets developed as follows in financial year 2017: As part of the regular impairment test for capitalized goodwill as of September 30, 2018, the expected cash outflow was determined based on the discounted cash flow procedure using the following defined parameters: Growth in the 2018 update phase in % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5% WACC 2018 in % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.9% The discounted cash flow method is used to determine value in use of the cash-generating units, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Such a detailed planning period reflects the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year, for the period after the three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for determining values in use is based on certain assumptions that are based on past experience, complemented by internal developments, and verified based on external market data and analyses. Key assumptions include the development of future selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. Significant changes to the aforementioned assumptions would influence the determination of the values in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates used are determined based on external factors derived from the market and are adjusted for the risks predominant in the cash-generating units in question. For the regular impairment test as of September 30, 2018 there was a headroom in the low triple-digit million range. Changes to the valuation parameters for the impairment test can influence the value in use of the cash-generating unit. A sensitivity analysis was therefore conducted for the cash-generating unit by using a 1.0 percentage point increase of the discount rate, a 0.5 percentage point reduction of the growth rate, and a 10.0 percentage point reduction of the EBIT. Based on these assumptions, there was a need for impairment in the amount of:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Other non-current provisions (Continued),103.222.1,,"For German Group companies, pension obligations developed as follows: The fair value of plan assets underlying the pension obligations developed as follows for German group companies: The net liability for international Group companies from defined benefit pension plans developed as follows: The amount of the income from plan assets for German Group companies is largely determined by raising the value of the plan assets of a commitment to the value of the gross obligation on the basis of the reinsurance available for this purpose. This decreased as a result of the slight increase in the discount rate in the 2018 financial year and thus had a reducing effect on income. The reduction in the income from plan assets abroad is mainly due to a negative performance of plan assets in the United Kingdom and a decrease in the income from plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the amount of plan assets is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation and is therefore crucially dependent on the development of the discount rate. In financial year 2018, the actuarial interest rate has risen. This has led to a reduction in the obligation and the plan assets and thus the income. The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and pension costs: As of December 31, 2018, the weighted duration of pension obligations amounted to 18 years (previous year: 18 years) for German Group companies and 17 years (previous year: 17 years) for foreign Group companies. In the coming financial years, the following payments from the Company and from plan assets overall are expected for defined benefit plans: The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future contributions received. Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the insurance, the company could be required to make an additional contribution payment. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations and plan assets, the assumptions of the AG forecast table 2018 were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality. Company-specific age-related annual fluctuation rates serve as a fluctuation assumption. In the United Kingdom, employees are provided with defined benefit plans that are concluded for new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension plans are subject to the United Kingdom Trust Law and the United Kingdom Pension Regulator. The pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A21.4 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table CMI 2015 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are no longer relevant for the pension plan. In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. The Group’s Swiss benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to A26.9 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A8.9 million).

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the company. For the Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 84%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these countries. In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension plans. Furthermore, regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a pension fund. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A41.6 million and were composed of three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans. In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany, as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally. Further more, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development. The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the STADA Arzneimittel AG Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff was transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future. Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands is, in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement or early death. In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A25.6 million. F-136 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As a result of the acquisition in 2017, STADA expected that a repayment could be made in the short term, which is why a corresponding disclosure of these financial liabilities in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2017, with short-term maturity was made. After the exercise option and the associated early repayment of due amounts expired in the first quarter of 2018, non-opted financial liabilities were reclassified accordingly in this period to current and non-current liabilities and the non-prematurely reduced financing agreements were assigned to their original terms on the balance sheet. STADA Arzneimittel AG and certain material subsidiaries (in accordance with the instructions given by the majority shareholder Nidda Healthcare GmbH) have provided certain collateral to secure capital market liabilities and other financial liabilities assumed by Nidda and its affiliated companies (including STADA) or for which Nidda and its affiliated companies (including STADA) have provided collateral. The provision of these collateral securities results in the holders of the bonds having the right to redeem the nominal amount and accrued interest under STADA bonds. The bond is therefore classified as current. In order to partially finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the purchase offer, Nidda BondCo GmbH issued a bond with a total volume of A250.0 million and an interest rate of 7.25% p.a. on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018 (‘‘Second SUN Bond’’). In addition, Nidda Healthcare GmbH received an additional loan under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility D’’). Bridge loans concluded for the acquisition of STADA Arzneimittel AG with a nominal volume of A485.0 million and A340.0 million were refinanced in financial year 2017 through two long-term bonds with a nominal volume of A735.0 (‘‘SSN bond’’) and A340.0 million (‘‘First SUN Bond’’).

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to A231.4 million in the reporting year (previous year: A72.0 million). Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the proceeds from disposals. This amounted to A�300.3 million in the reporting year (previous year: A�2,465.8 million). In financial year 2018, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets amounted to A280.3 million (previous year: A17.6 million), of which A255.4 million (previous year: A12.1 million) were attributable to payments for significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio. Cash flow from investing activities was characterized by payments for investments in intangible assets, which mainly related to the acquisition of the rights to the medical dandruff shampoo Nizoral� for the EMEA region and the reacquisition of the trademark rights to the sunscreen Ladival�. In the context of business combinations, there were net inflows from the acquisition of the majority interest in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents acquired at the time of acquisition exceeded the purchase price. Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies related to dividends of STADA Vietnam J.V., which is accounted for using the equity method.

The payments made through this business combination for the acquisition of the shares totaled A2,434.5 million in 2017. Included in that is the cash taken over at the time of the acquisition in the amount of A270.2 million, which has already been deducted. Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A�45.7 million in financial year 2018 and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution payments as well as additions to shareholders’ equity (previous year: A2,883.1 million). In order to finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the purchase offer, Nidda BondCo GmbH issued the Second SUN Bond with a volume of A250.0 million on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018. In addition, Nidda Healthcare GmbH received an additional loan under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility D’’). Conversely, cash flow from financing activities includes payments of A1,447.0 million made in connection with the delisting tender offer as a change in minority interests. Furthermore, in the second quarter of 2018, a bond issued by STADA Arzneimittel AG in the amount of A347.1 million took place and was repayed according to schedule. In the previous year, the development of cash flow from financing activities was influenced by the financing measures—particularly the drawing of the first loan facilities under the syndicated loan agreement—in connection with the acquisition of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Additionally, Nidda BondCo GmbH issued the SSN Bond with a nominal value of A735.0 million and Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued the First SUN Bond with a nominal volume of A340.0 million. In addition, in 2017 the loan in the amount of A1,002.7 million issued by Nidda Midco S.`a.r.l was included in cash flow from financing activities. Payments for dividend distributions amounted to A4.5 million (previous year: A15.6 million).

If a need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy levels. The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose, market comparisons and change analyses are carried out. Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include positive or negative market values of derivative financial instruments (currency swaps and interest rate swaps, in the previous year currency and interest swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards are determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties. In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB), (EUR/DKK), (EUR/CHF), (EUR/USD) and (EUR/GBP) are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from intercompany loans with companies that keep their accounting in a local currency other than euros. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective. F-152 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Risk management and derivative financial instruments (Continued),103.351.1,,"On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk). However, the Group is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency risks hrough, alongside natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, use was made of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures contracts are adjusted to the term of the underlying transactions. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year. In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally negative and depreciation is generally positive. Determined quantitative disclosures were made on risks in connection with currency changes by means of aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective Group company’s functional currency. In the case of hedging transactions, they are compared with the balances of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the foreign currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison with the respective functional currency are as follows: The outstanding foreign currency items British pounds relate to a balance from foreign currency holdings from German and international Group companies in British pounds and outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro. For the Serbian dinar this relates to a balance from foreign currency holdings at international Group companies in euro. The outstanding foreign currency reserves in Kazakhstani tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia relate to a balance from international Group companies in euro and outstanding foreign currency reserves in Kazakhstani tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia. The reported outstanding foreign currency positions in US dollars relate exclusively to foreign currency holdings in US dollars at German and international Group companies. The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective, results from the functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall, based on outstanding foreign currency items as of the reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A25.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million) or in the amount of earnings of A25.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million). The maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized. In addition, the Group granted guarantees that amounted to a total nominal volume of A29.0 million as of the reporting date (previous year: A63.1 million). Various forms of collateral for credit securities are held, such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of receivables and pledged inventories.

Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued),103.418.1,,"For the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities, initial application of IFRS 9 has had the following impacts: Due to the new regulations on impairment, expected losses are recognized as expenses earlier under IFRS 9. While under IAS 39 the incurred losses model was relevant for establishment of a risk provision, under IFRS 9 they are based on the expected credit losses model. STADA applied the simplified approach for trade accounts receivable. For other financial assets, the general approach is applied on principle. As a result of the initial application of the impairment regulations in accordance with IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018, the total amount of impairments increased by A2.7 million. The reconciliation of the risk provision under IAS 39 to expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 is described below: financial year. All of STADA’s license agreements are either bound to the achieved sales of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. If this were not the case for such license agreements, the result, due to the new IFRS 15 standard, future sales would be realized in the amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore no longer, as they are presently, divided over the term of the license. The effects of first-time application of the new IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards as of January 1, 2018 on STADA’s consolidated balance sheet are described in condensed form below: EBITDA. The change-over effect relates at STADA for the most part to leased real estate, company vehicles as well as office and business equipment. Furthermore, in May 2017, IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’’ was issued by the IASB, through which a clarification of the requirements of the approach and measurement of uncertain earnings positions arose. According to this, a company within the scope of the assessment of the uncertainty must estimate how probable the acceptance of the tax treatment of business transactions in the respective tax jurisdictions is. The interpretation is to be applied for financial years which begin on or after January 1, 2019, whereby earlier application is permitted. STADA currently finds itself in the evaluation on the impact of IFRIC 23 on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In addition, the cash flow condition must be met. This is the case when the contractual features of the financial assets at fixed times provide exclusively for interest and discharge payments toward the outstanding principal. The new regulations for the classification of financial assets have led to changes for the receivables that can be factored in terms of their measurement and presentation as a result of the underlying business model. These financial assets, which remain under trade accounts receivable, are no longer measured at amortized cost, but at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these receivables are therefore recognized directly in equity through other comprehensive income in the FVOCI reserve. Meanwhile, financial assets that are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income are fundamentally subject to the same impairment model as the financial assets recognized at amortized cost. Under IFRS 9, equity instruments in general and derivatives are always recognized at fair value through profit or loss. For equity instruments, IFRS 9 offers the choice to record changes in fair value under other comprehensive income. STADA has not made use of this option to date. F-172 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. STADA applied the new standard on January 1, 2018 for the first time. In doing so, STADA made use of its right to choose simplified initial application. Accordingly, the contracts that were not fully completed as of January 1, 2018 are accounted for as if the new standard IFRS 15 were already applied when these contracts began so that the cumulative effect from the change will be recognized directly in equity. There is no adjustment of the comparable figures from the prior-year period. Initial application of IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018 led to an augmenting cumulative effect of A0.4 million that was recognized in retained earnings. The effect resulted primarily from the to be accounted contract assets which in future are to be shown within the scope of return regulations and the deferred taxes to be established as a result. Furthermore, application resulted in reclassification of A0.6 million of down payments from trade accounts payable to contract liabilities. The new standard on revenue recognition will thus has little impact on sales accounting, as sales are largely realized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of routine transactions. There are no agreements in the Group governing multiple services in a contract or in several contracts (multi-element arrangements). There were also no changes made in the accounting for license agreements, as they amounted to less than 2% of total sales in the 2017 F-173 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. STADA will apply the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and thereby likely modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures will be waived. In this context, the rights of use will likely be equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change. An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements has not yet been fully completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet, as required by IFRS 16, a significant increase in the balance sheet total is expected at the point of initial application. Given the current lease agreements and the currently available study results, STADA anticipates the recognition of rights of use in the amount of approximately A40 million and the recording of lease obligations in the amount of A40 million. Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of amendments to IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on the EBITDA. Based on the current status of the study, STADA assumes that the write-downs of current lease agreements will in total amount to approximately A40 million in future. In addition, STADA expects future interest expenses in the amount of approximately A10 million.

The shares of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary. The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity investors. Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized. Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests. If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized.

Business combinations,103.469.1,,"In financial year 2018, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in greater detail below. As of September 27, 2018 STADA assumed control of the German company BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Bad Vilbel. The company produces the active ingredient erythropoietin and markets it primarily by issuing sales licenses to STADAPHARM and other third parties. BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which was previously included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as an associated company, as well as its subsidiary NorBiTec GmbH, have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as subsidiaries since September 30, 2018 with consideration of minority interests. Assumption of control occurred as a result of acquisition of an additional 35.48% of other shareholders shares, so that STADA—together with the shares it already held—holds 51.34% of shares in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and is therefore the majority shareholder in the company. The purchase price for the acquisition in the amount of A35.0 million was paid entirely in cash. The acquisition took place on September 27, 2018 following approval by anti-trust authorities as per the purchase agreement concluded in August of 2018. Within the scope of the final purchase price allocation, there were significant changes as compared to the preliminary purchase price allocation as of September 30, 2018. These are attributable in particular to the measurement of intangible assets. Accordingly, a negative difference in the amount of A27.6 million arose which is considered a bargain purchase and which resulted as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Based on the negative difference determined as part of the purchase price allocation, the procedures used to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed were reviewed again. In this context, it was ensured that all information available at the time of acquisition had been adequately taken into account in the valuation. The share of the company held by non-controlling shareholders determined at the time of purchase as part of the purchase price allocation was A74.2 million. This corresponds to a 48.66% share of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG net assets, which is derived from the fair value of assets and liabilities at the time of purchase.

Sales of the BIOCEUTICALS Group for the first three months since initial consolidation amounted to approximately A4.2 million. The operating profit of this business combination adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (around A4.4 million) amounted to approximately A0.3 million in the reporting year. If STADA had acquired the BIOCEUTICALS Group by January 1, 2018, progression on a straight-line-basis in 2018 would have generated sales of approximately A16.8 million and operating profit adjusted for effects from the purchase price allocation (approximately A17.6 million) of approximately A1.2 million.

The anticipated transaction price is affected by variable considerations, which should, however, be taken into consideration exclusively if it is highly likely that there will be no significant retraction of sales upon elimination of uncertainty with respect to the variable consideration. The amount of the variable consideration is determined by applying the anticipated value method. Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective contract in force. All STADA license agreements either are bound to the sales generated by the licensee or further activities of STADA are required which enable the licensee to use his or her right. As a consequence, sales are realized over the terms of the contract period. Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses related to deferrals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are realized. use of the cash-generating unit. The dis-counted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original historical costs. receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account. The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)",103.494.1,,"market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years. For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future. STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as the customers’ credit-worthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries. STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income tax expenses in each tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the STADA Group is being allotted to a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date. The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds. The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success of these methods. The F-189 ----- determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of probable sales.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The effective income tax rate in the previous year was 35.9%. The nominal income tax rate amounted to 28.3% in financial year 2018 for STADA Arzneimittel AG in Germany. This includes corporate tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the solidarity surcharge in the amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 357%. The nominal income tax rate of STADA Arzneimittel AG is thus unchanged as compared to the previous year. For temporary differences from undistributed earnings of subsidiaries in the amount of A22.4 million, no deferred tax liabilities were established, because these profits will be reinvested for an indefinite period. The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement was derived from the expected income tax expense.

Income tax expenses (Continued),103.519.1,,"Actual income tax expenses recognized in the income statement can be divided according to timing as follows: The tax expense of STADA Arzneimittel AG in the financial year was mainly influenced by the conclusion of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with the shareholder Nidda Healthcare GmbH. This resulted in a change in the tax status of STADA Arzneimittel AG, which has been included in the single tax entity of Nidda BondCo GmbH with its tax results since 2018 and must pay corporate tax exclusively for 20/17 of the compensation payment to be made to the outside shareholders. No tax allocation agreement was concluded with Nidda Healthcare GmbH as the direct parent company and/or Nidda BondCo GmbH as the indirect parent company. Income taxes are therefore reported in accordance with the formal approach. Accordingly, all deferred taxes of the former German controlling company STADA Arzneimittel AG were transferred to the new controlling company Nidda BondCo GmbH. Nidda BondCo GmbH also has to pay corporation tax, solidarity surcharge and trade tax on the taxable income of STADA Arzneimittel AG, while STADA Arzneimittel AG is responsible for the taxation of recurring compensation payments. The actual income tax expenses and deferred taxes recognized in the balance sheet were as follows: impairments on such assets. The increase in loss carryforwards results in particular from the first-time inclusion of BIOCEUTICALS AG as a subsidiary due to the change in status. Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under ‘‘Tax loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the reporting date on the December 31, 2018 reporting date amounted to A72.7 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A25.7 million). Tax effects from loss and interest carryforwards led in the financial year to an increase in the income tax expense in the amount of A1.2 million (previous year: increase in expenses from taxes on profits of A3.1 million). This development was primarily influenced by British tax law which, from April 1, 2017 for the first time limits the deduction of operating expenses for interest (interest barrier) which led to an interest carryforward for which no deferred tax assets were established. The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to their expiry date:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As of the reporting date, the number of employees of the STADA Group increased in 2018 by 2% to 10,416 (previous year: 10,176). This increase was mainly due to the consolidation of the German company NorBiTec GmbH in the course of the majority takeover of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and the Hungarian STADA Hungary LLC. In addition, the increase in the number of employees as of the reporting date was due to the expansion of the marketing and sales division of the German subsidiary STADAPHARM GmbH and the Spanish subsidiary Laboratorio STADA S.L. Personnel expenses, which are included in the expenses of the individual functional areas according to their functional relevance, increased in financial year 2018 to A359.3 million (previous year: A387.5 million). The decrease resulted mainly from the decrease in the number of employees in Russia and the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as of November 30, 2017. 1 On August 26, 2016, the STADA General Meeting resolved to eliminate restrictions on the transferability of registered shares by means of a change to the Articles of Incorporation. The change to the Articles of Incorporation was entered in the commercial register on December 9, 2016 and took effect on this date. Therefore, since that time, the authorization from approved capital pursuant to Section 6 (1) of the Articles of Incorporation relates to registered shares with no transferability restrictions.

The umbrella brand Hemofarm which was capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the Hemofarm group is included in capitalized trademarks recognized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, because STADA intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2018, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A39.0 million (previous year: A38.9 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 13.7% were used. There was no necessity for impairment in the reporting year. In addition, the change compared to the previous year figure of A0.1 million is attributable to different exchange rates. Furthermore, in the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in 2013, the umbrella brand Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as STADA intends to continue to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2018, this has a carrying amount of A8.8 million (previous year: A8.6 million). The change is a result of different exchange rates. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 14.3% were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year. As part of the acquisition of Laboratorio Vannier, the umbrella brand Vannier was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark as STADA intends to continue to use the trademark. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 17.8% were used. An impairment loss of A0.2 million was recognized for the reporting year.

Intangible assets (Continued),103.548.1,,"Borrowing costs capitalized in 2018 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the production of a qualifying asset amounted to A2.6 million (previous year: A1.5 million). In financial year 2018, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was 2.5% (previous year: 1.6%). Development costs of A23.7 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A23.9 million). Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify for capitalization as expenses in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year 2018, these development costs amounted to of A72.3 million (previous year: A67.5 million). Amortization of intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an amount of A88.0 million (previous year: A86.5 million). In financial year 2018, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of A42.0 million (previous year: A55.7 million). As in the previous year, no valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year.

This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate was assumed for the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon. The detailed planning phase for determining the value in use are based on assumptions from past experience expanded to include current developments and verified using external market data and analyses. The most important assumptions include the development of future sales prices, amounts and costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth rates. Significant changes to the above-described assumptions would influence the determination of the value in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates applied are determined on the basis of external factors derived from the market and adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the cash-generating units. Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the different cash-generating units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no necessity for an impairment to any cash-generating unit. F-202 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, net income in the amount of A0.7 million after deferred taxes—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling interests—resulted from the remeasurement. It is mainly based on the increase in the discount rate for various defined benefit plans in the STADA Group underlying the measurement of December 31, 2018 in comparison with December 31, 2017. In addition, this position also includes currency translation differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized in equity from performance-oriented pension plans as well as the deferred taxes they incur which, in financial year 2018, amounted to expenses recognized in equity of A0.03 million.

Other non-current provisions (Continued),103.611.1,,"Plan assets were divided according to investment type as follows: For international Group companies, pension obligations developed as follows: The fair value of plan assets underlying the pension obligations developed as follows for international Group companies: The amount of the pension provisions recognized as of the reporting date for companies with plan assets was therefore as follows: The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and pension costs: In the coming financial years, the following payments from the Company and from plan assets overall are expected for defined benefit plans: contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future contributions received. Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the insurance, the company could be required to make an additional contribution payment. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations and plan assets, the assumptions of the AG forecast table 2018 were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality. Company-specific age-related annual fluctuation rates serve as a fluctuation assumption. In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees with defined benefit plans that are concluded for new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension plan plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator. The pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A21.4 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table CMI 2015 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are no longer relevant for the pension plan. In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to A26.9 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A26.8 million).

The amount of the income of plan assets for German Group companies is mainly determined by an increase of the plan assets of an approval to the level of the gross obligation as a result of existing reinsurance; this decreased as a consequence of the slight increase in the actuarial interest rate in financial year 2018 an has therefore had a decreasing effect on income. The reduction of the plan assets outside Germany is mainly attributable to a negative performance of the plan assets in the United Kingdom and a decrease in the income of the plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the amount of the plan assets is calculated on the basis of an actuarial measurement and thus depends decisively on the development of the actuarial interest rate. In financial year 2018, the actuarial interest rate increased; this led to a reduction of the obligation as well as assets and consequently of income. F-215 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the company. For the STADA Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 84%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these countries. In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension plans. Regulations and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a pension fund. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A41.6 million and were composed of three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans. In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany, as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally. Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development. The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff was transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future. Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands is, in part, financed through insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement or early death. In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A25.6 million. The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the F-217 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

After the exercise option expired and the associated amounts called due were repaid early in the first quarter of 2018, the financial liabilities not optioned were reclassified accordingly from current to current and non-current liabilities and thus the financing agreements that were not retired early were assigned to their original maturities on the balance sheet.

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to A320.3 million in the reporting year (previous year: A262.9 million). This development was mainly due to a significant increase in gross cash flow as a result of a strong annual result and lower income tax payments. In addition, there were significantly lower cash outflows in connection with inventories and slight cash inflows in connection with trade accounts receivables compared with significant cash outflows in the previous year. Additionally, significantly lower consumption from the deferrals for healthcare insurance settlements was recorded. This was offset by significantly higher cash outflows from the settlement of trade accounts payable, which were high at the end of the previous year. Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from disposals.

Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A9.2 million (previous year: A5.7 million). Cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by payments for investments in intangible assets in financial year 2018, primarily relating to the acquisition of the rights to the medical dandruff shampoo Nizoral� for the EMEA region and the reacquisition of the rights to the sunscreen Ladival�. In the context of business combinations, there were net inflows from the acquisition of the majority interest in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents acquired at the time of acquisition exceeded the purchase price. Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies related to dividends of STADA Vietnam J.V., which was accounted for using the equity method, which represent partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell the shares in this company held by STADA as of December 31, 2019. Cash flow from financing activities amounted to A79.7 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: �A227.8 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. This development was primarily attributable to significant increase in financial liabilities due to the loans granted to STADA by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH. This was offset by higher repayments of financial liabilities. This resulted in particular from the following material effects: Due to the takeover in 2017, the creditors of STADA Arznei-mittel AG were entitled in accordance with the financing conditions to prematurely terminate bonds, promissory note loans and bank loans. Among other things, a partial amount of A360.2 million made due prematurely in the first quarter of 2018 in this context. In the second quarter of 2018, the scheduled repayment of a bond in the amount of A347.1 million was another material effect. Dividend distribution payments of A6.8 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders of STADA Arznei-mittel AG for financial year 2017. Given the high level of expenditures for investments, free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities amounted to A20.0 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A140.2 million). Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

Segment reporting,103.691.1,,"The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting methods used in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements. Services between the segments are charged based on market prices. Segmentation within the STADA Group is based on sales differentiation. Thus, the allocation to the individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reallocated. In accordance with the reporting structure the Group is managed by operating segment, i.e. in accordance with the two segments Generics and Branded Products. Generics are products for the health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two following criteria: - The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient or - the product is an integral part of a marketing concept targeting more than one product and indication for primarily prescription products with active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired, or - the product is sold under its international non-proprietary name (INN). Branded products are products for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two following criteria: - The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and other Group products, or - the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly sold under a product- specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and other Group products. All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be directly allocated to the segments, as well as the elimination of sales between segments are recognized under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and consolidation. Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not, however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance organization billings are included here. Reporting of the segment liabilities and non-current segment assets is waived, as this is without relevance for Group monitoring and for Group reporting. F-226 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Additionally, potential obligations as a result of a ban on economic activities between Russia and Ukraine ceased to exist.

If a need for reclassification is determined, the re-classification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications between the respective hierarchy levels. The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose, market comparisons and change analyses are carried out. Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include positive or negative market values of derivative financial instruments (currency forwards, in the previous year interest rate swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards are determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties. STADA designates currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/DKK, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD and EUR/GBP) as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company loans. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value spot components of the currency forwards of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging.

However, STADA is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency-related risks through, in addition to natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, STADA made use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures contracts is adjusted to the term of the underlying transaction. The residual term of the contracts is currently up to one year. In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally negative and depreciation is generally positive. STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective Group company’s functional currency. In case of hedging transactions they are compared with the balances of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the foreign currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison with respective functional currency are as follows: led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A3.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million) or in the amount of earnings of A3.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million). liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of the STADA Group at all times by maintaining a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves.

Alongside the implementation of appropriate credit management processes, such transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing to avoid default risks in financing activities. Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. STADA therefore strives to maintain business relations only with partners of impeccable financial standing. In addition, STADA partly uses suitable measures such as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard itself against default risk. Past due receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored and potential default risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that in a difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments to STADA or business partners of STADA and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks arise. STADA’s maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized. In addition, STADA granted guarantees, which amounted to a total nominal volume of A29.0 million (previous year: A63.1 million) as of the reporting date (see Note 46.).

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.

Accounting treatment of material acquisitions Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows: 1. Matter and issue 2. Audit approach and findings 3. Reference to further information Hereinafter we present the key audit matters:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.771,1.** **Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets,103.771.1,,"1. The ‘‘Intangible assets’’ balance sheet item reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included EUR 389 million (11% of consolidated total assets) for ‘‘Goodwill’’ and EUR 1,145 million (32% of consolidated total assets) for ‘‘Regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, customer relationships, software, licenses and similar rights’’. While goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment (‘‘impairment test’’) on an annual basis or if there are indications of impairment, such a test needs only to be carried out for intangible assets with definite useful lives if there are indications of impairment (‘‘triggering events’’). Goodwill is tested for impairment at the level of the group of cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill is allocated. In an impairment test, the carrying amount of the respective cash-generating unit (including the affected goodwill) is compared against the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. In a first step, the Company generally conducts the test based on the value in use. For the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives, the relief from royalty method is initially applied. The Company has identified certain indicators, which are monitored and in case of negative development trigger an impairment test for assets with definite useful lives. In the case of regulatory drug approvals, however, an impairment test is carried out in each instance at the end of the financial year. Brands and regulatory drug approvals are normally measured based on the present value of future cash flows generated by the affected asset from marketing the respective products. An impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount is less than the respective carrying amount. Present value is calculated using discounted cash flow models. The starting point is the Group’s financial plan, which is projected forward using growth assumptions. The discount rate used is the weighted cost of capital for the relevant cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. The result of this measurement depends to a large extent on estimates made by the executive directors’ with respect to future cash inflows and the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background, and due to the complex nature of the measurement, this matter was of particular significance for our audit. 2. As part of our audit, we reviewed the methodological procedure adopted for the purpose of the impairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted cost of capital, among other things. We verified the appropriateness of the future cash inflows used in the measurement, including by comparing these disclosures with the current budgets in the financial plan prepared by the executive directors’ and approved by the supervisory board, and by reconciling them against general and sectorspecific market expectations. We also assessed whether the basis for including the costs of Group functions was accurate. With the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the recoverable amounts calculated in this way, we also focused F-245 ----- our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated the measurement model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we reproduced the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company and carried out our own additional sensitivity analyses with respect to those cash-generating units with low headroom (recoverable amount compared with the carrying amount). Taking into account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the allocated goodwill, were adequately covered by the discounted future net cash inflows. Overall, the measurement inputs and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable. 3. The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and intangible assets are contained in notes 9 ‘‘Accounting policies’’ and 24 ‘‘Intangible assets’’ to the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.772,2.** **Revenue recognition including expected revenue reductions,103.772.1,,"1. The EUR 2,330.8 million reported under ‘‘Sales’’ in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate primarily to the sale of products and provision of services. Since large-volume transactions are involved, the company has established comprehensive processes and systems for recognizing and deferring sales. Revenue is recognized when the goods have been delivered or the services rendered. The transaction price is measured as the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services. Variable consideration is considered when measuring the transaction price (discounts to health insurance organizations, other health sector institutions and customers, as well as expected returns, among others). When recognizing revenue, material assumptions have to be made with respect to discounts that must subsequently be granted and returns that must subsequently be accepted, and the corresponding revenue adjustments have to be recognized. Particularly in Germany, discount arrangements with health insurance organizations are agreed for a specific pharmaceutical ingredient by means of tenders over a specific period of time. The corresponding drug is initially sold to patients at a binding sales price, which is then subject to a discount subsequently granted to the respective health insurance organization. The revenue adjustments are based to a large degree on the executive directors’ estimates and assumptions and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainties. Against this background and due to the underlying complexity of the measurement on which this significant item in terms of its amount was based, this matter was of particular significance for our audit. 2. Our audit included assessing the appropriateness and effectiveness of the processes and controls within the Company’s internal control system established to realize revenue and make revenue adjustments, including the IT systems used. To this end, we also involved our specialists from Risk Assurance Services (RAS). With the knowledge that the complexity of the accounting treatment and the estimates and assumptions to be made give rise to an increased risk of accounting misstatements, we assessed the appropriateness of the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to revenue adjustments. At the same time, we verified and assessed the methodology applied by the executive directors to make revenue adjustments. We also used the detailed information obtained to assess the relevant assumptions made by the executive directors as of the balance sheet date. In addition, we verified the consistency of the methods used by the Company to recognize revenue and make revenue adjustments. We also compared the revenue adjustments with contract documents. In doing so, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates applied and the assumptions made by the executive directors concerning the recognition and measurement of revenue were sufficiently documented and that the estimates applied and the assumptions made by the executive directors were consistently derived. 3. The Company’s disclosures relating to revenue recognition are contained in notes 9 ‘‘Accounting policies’’ and 11 ‘‘Sales’’ to the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.773,3.** **Accounting treatment of material acquisitions,103.773.1,,"1. In the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018, the Nizoral and Ladival trademarks are recognized at amortized cost of EUR 190.3 million under the ‘‘Intangible assets’’ balance sheet line item as material additions (EUR 195.6 million) during the reporting period. In F-246 ----- addition, control over the Bioceuticals Group was acquired as of September 30, 2018, due to the acquisition of a further 35.5% interest to total 51.3% of the shares of Bioceuticals Arzneimittel AG. STADA Arzneimittel AG acquired the trademark to Nizoral as of June 21, 2018, and the trademark to Ladival as of June 17, 2018, for a total of EUR 195.6 million. The agreements are accounted for as an asset acquisition, whereby the acquired trademarks are carried at cost and amortized. In addition, the acquisition of control over the Bioceuticals Group was accounted for as a business combination by recognizing the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. Taking into consideration the purchase price of EUR 35.0 million for the additional interest, the remeasurement of previously held interests as required under IFRS 3, and the EUR 78.3 million share of the net assets acquired attributable to STADA AG, this results in a bargain purchase of EUR 27.6 million recognized in profit or loss. In view of the complexity of identifying and measuring the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the business combination and the material cumulative impact of the acquisitions on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the STADA Group, these were of particular significance in the context of our audit. 2. In auditing the accounting treatment of the acquisitions of intangible assets and shares, we began by inspecting and assessing the agreements. Among other things, we agreed the purchase prices paid by STADA Arzneimittel AG as consideration for the acquired assets and shares to the supporting documentation for the payments made, as provided to us. The recognition and measurement of the acquisitions was assessed in particular on the basis of the criteria for an asset acquisition or a business combination. We examined whether the acquisitions of the Nizoral and Ladival trademarks were properly accounted for as asset acquisitions and whether the acquisition of control over the Bioceuticals Group was properly accounted for as a business combination. For the business combination, we assessed the underlying opening balance sheets. A valuation report was available to us for the purchase price allocation performed pursuant to IFRS 3, and we assessed this report accordingly. Given the specific measurement characteristics, we were assisted by our internal valuation specialists. Among other things, they assessed the appropriateness of the methods on which the measurements were based as well as the measurement parameters used. We assessed fair values that were measured centrally (e.g., of customer relationships) by reconciling quantity structure with the original financial accounting records and the parameters used. We also used checklists to establish whether the requirements set out in IFRS 3 for disclosures in the notes to the financial statements had been complied with in full. We checked that the EUR 27.6 million bargain purchase was recognized under ‘‘Other income’’ in the consolidated income statement. On the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the recognition in the financial statements of the acquisitions of intangible assets and the business combination under consideration of the assumptions and measurement parameters underlying the measurement is appropriate overall. 3. The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and intangible assets are contained in notes 8 ‘‘Business Combinations’’, 9 ‘‘Accounting policies’’ and 24 ‘‘Intangible assets’’ to the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial Statements. The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement. The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or non-current distinction. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the notes are shown in euro thousands (A k).

The standard replaces IAS 39 and introduces new rules for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments. Furthermore, IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. STADA will apply the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018, pursuant to the transitional regulations of IFRS 9, an adjustment of prior-year figures is waived. Accordingly, the cumulative effect from initial application of IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018 will be recognized in equity with no effect on profit or loss. This will likely result in the following impacts for the Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA: The new regulations for the classification of financial assets will lead to changes for the receivables that can be factored in terms of their measurement and presentation as a result of the underlying business model. In the future, these will no longer be measured at amortized cost, but rather at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of these receivables will in future be recognized directly in equity. Within the scope of the initial application as of January 1, 2018, this will result in no material effects. Due to the new regulations on impairment, expected losses will in future be recognized as expenses earlier. In this context, STADA will apply the simplified approach for trade receivables as well as contract assets. F-257 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727
476,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,173,GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT,173.26,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued),173.26.1,,"As a result of the initial application of the impairment regulations in accordance with IFRS 9, as of January 1, 2018, the volume of impairments, on the basis of an analysis that is still to be finalized, will likely increase to somewhere in the magnitude of between A 6 million and A 9 million. In May 2014, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’. IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. STADA will apply the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018. In this context, STADA will exercise its right to choose the simplified initial application. Accordingly, the contracts that were not fully completed as of January 1, 2018 will be accounted for as if the new standard IFRS 15 were already applied when these contracts began so that the cumulative effect from the change will be recognized directly in equity. There is no adjustment of the comparable figures from the prior-year period. In accordance with the preliminary analysis, from the initial application of IFRS 15 there is an increased cumulative effect in the likely amount of A 0.4 million to be recognized in retained earnings. The effect resulted primarily from the to be accounted contractual assets which in future are to be shown within the scope of return regulations and the deferred taxes to be established as a result. Furthermore, there will be reclassifications as result of down payments received from the trade payables and payments in the contractual liabilities in the likely amount of A 0.6 million. The new standard on revenue recognition will thus have little impact on sales accounting, as sales are largely realized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of routine transactions. There are no agreements in the Group which regulate multiple services within one contract or within several contracts (multi-element arrangements). There will be no changes in the accounting of licensing agreements, which amounted to less than 2% of the total sales revenue in financial year 2017. All of STADA’s license agreements are either bound to the achieved sales of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. If this were not the case for such license agreements, the result, due to the new IFRS 15 standard, future sales would be realized in the amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore no longer, as they are presently, divided over the term of the license. In January 2016, the IASB published the new IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ standard, which determines the recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (financial liabilities) associated with leases in the balance sheet for lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. STADA will apply the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and thereby likely modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures will be waived. In this context, the rights of use will likely be equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change. An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements has not yet been fully completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet, as required by IFRS 16, a significant increase in the balance sheet total is expected at the point of initial application. In accordance with the currently existing leasing agreements and the currently available investigation results, STADA expects an accounting of use of rights in the amount of approximately A 40 million as well as recognition of leasing obligations in the amount of A 40 million. Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of amendments to IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on the EBITDA. STADA, pursuant to the current status of the investigation, assumes that the depreciation of the currently existing leasing agreements will in future amount to approximately A 40 million. In addition, STADA expects future interest expenses in the amount of approximately A 10 million. In accordance with the previous requirements of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’, these expenses would have been fully recognized in operating profit as a leasing expense and as a reduction of EBITDA. The changeover effect relates at STADA for the most part to leased real estate, company vehicles as well as office and business equipment. Furthermore, in May 2017, IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’’ was issued by the IASB, through which a clarification of the requirements of the approach and measurement of uncertain earnings positions arose. According to this, a company within the scope of the assessment of the uncertainty must estimate how probable the acceptance of the tax treatment of business transactions in the respective tax F-258 ----- jurisdictions is. The interpretation is to be applied for financial years which begin on or after January 1, 2019, whereby earlier application is permitted. STADA currently finds itself in the evaluation on the impact of IFRIC 23 on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by STADA and are therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if STADA Arzneimittel AG or its subsidiaries are in control of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of voting rights of more than 50%. Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method. Associates are companies over which STADA can have significant influence and are not subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method. Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the business, financial and earnings situation of the STADA Group is insignificant, are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for either at fair value or at amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet total of these companies make up about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

In addition, as of July 19, 2017, the legal merger of the two Russian companies OOO STADA PharmDevelopment and OOO STADA CIS into OOO STADA Marketing and the continuation of the company name OOO STADA Marketing.

Unchanged from the previous year, BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as an associate in accordance with the equity method. STADA holds 15.86% of the shares in this company.

Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates",173.72.1,,"According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full— irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the acquiree, STADA recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary. The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity investors. Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized. Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests. If indications arise from the application of IAS 39 that the carrying amount determined using the equity method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an associate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

It must also be possible to reliably measure the Company’s own costs incurred or to be incurred.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective contract in force.

Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives at the level of the individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the level of the individual companies that generate sales under the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist. Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of sales are determined based on weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on production facilities. Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

As a rule, the objective of a development process at STADA is to obtain national or multinational regulatory drug approval. Downstream from the development process is an evaluation process at the end of which a decision on the actual execution of a development is made. Within the development process itself, development costs relative to approvals for new drugs obtained by STADA result in capitalization as intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met: - It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to become available for use or sale. - The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use (i.e. usually to market it oneself) or sell it in the future. - The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit. - It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

Instead, an impairment test is performed at least",173.88.1,,"once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a market region within the two operating segments of the STADA Group for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill. STADA carries out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost.

Capitalization requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied at STADA due to a lack of relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment.

In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to be taken into consideration for various Group companies.

STADA reports these financial liabilities in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item. Here, those derivative financial instruments are also included which serve to hedge interest rate and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments, and which are also measured at fair value in accordance with the regulations of IAS 39 on hedge accounting. Unless market prices are available, fair value is determined with measurement models based on discounted cash flow models. Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging instruments are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the hedged underlying transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in addition to the fair value change in the derivative, the opposing fair value change in the underlying transaction is recognized in profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the hedged risk.

Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)",173.99.1,,"circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed below. As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions. STADA carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from ‘‘Corporate Assets’’ to the carrying amounts of the respective cash-generating units and an allocation from ‘‘Corporate Costs’’ are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on the basis of individual appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined in the context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years. For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future. STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries. STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the STADA Group is being allotted to a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. F-273 ----- When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date. The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds. The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success of these methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities. Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of probable sales.",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The reduction in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets compared with the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization on intangible assets with purchase price allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as from impairments on such assets. Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under ‘‘Tax loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the balance sheet date on the December 31, 2017 reporting date amounted to A 25.7 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 30.9 million). Tax effects from loss and interest carryforwards led in the financial year to an increase in the income tax expense in the amount of A 3.1 million (previous year: reduction in the income tax expense by A 6.1 million). This development was primarily influenced by British tax law which, from April 1, 2017 for the first time limits the deduction of operating expenses for interest (interest barrier) which led to an interest carryforward for which no deferred tax assets were established. The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to their expiry date:",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

The significant additions to the number of employees reached are based on the acquisition of a Serbian product portfolio including the associated sales structures, the purchase of the British branded product company Natures Aid and the assumption of sales activities in Belgium. Although all three measures were attributable to financial year 2016, they nevertheless resulted in an increase in personnel mainly in the reporting year. Furthermore, there was an increase in the number of employees resulting from the initial consolidation of the Serbian wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o. in 2017. This was countered by the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as of November 30, 2017 and the average number of employees thus remained at the level of the previous year. As of the balance sheet date, the STADA Group’s number of employees in 2017 decreased by 7% to 10,176 (previous year: 10,923), this reduction resulted mainly from the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their functional relevance, increased in financial year 2017 to A 387.5 million (previous year: A 365.7 million).

Intangible assets (Continued),173.155.1,,"Additions from business combinations according to IFRS 3, which relate to the fair value calculated in the context for the purchase price allocations resulted in the reporting year from the acquisition of the Serbian wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o. In the reporting year, reclassifications of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale relate to STADA Vietnam J.V., which in the previous year was considered as IFRS 5 reporting. In the reporting year, reclassifications of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale relate to an approval for an Italian branded product. The umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the Hemofarm group is included in recognized trademarks as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as STADA intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2017, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A 38.9 million (previous year: A 37.4 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2017, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.8% were used. There was no necessity for impairment in the reporting year. In addition, the change compared to the previous year figure of A 1.5 million is attributable to different exchange rates. Furthermore, in the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in 2013, the umbrella brand Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as STADA intends to continue to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2017, these have a carrying amount of A 8.6 million (previous year: A 9.7 million). The change is a result of different exchange rates. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2017, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 12.5% were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year. As part of the acquisition of Laboratorio Vannier in the previous year, the umbrella brand Vannier was capitalized as an intangible asset and an indefinite useful life as a trademark as STADA intends to continue to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2017, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A 0.2 million (previous year: A 0.3 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2017, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 17.8% were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year. Borrowing costs capitalized in 2017 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the production of a qualifying asset amounted to A 1.5 million (previous year: A 1.4 million). In financial year 2017, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was 1.6% (previous year: 2.0%). Development costs of A 23.9 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A 31.0 million). Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify for capitalization as expense in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year 2017, these development costs amounted to of A 67.5 million (previous year: A 65.1 million). Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an amount of A 86.5 million (previous year: A 83.5 million). In financial year 2017, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of A 55.7 million (previous year: A 61.8 million). As in the previous year, no valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year. Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation (see Note 5.).

This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for the determination of the value in use is based on assumptions in light of past experience, supplemented by current internal developments and verified through external market data and analyses. The most important assumptions include the development of future sales prices, amounts and costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth rates. Significant changes to the above-described assumptions would influence the determination of the value in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates applied are determined on the basis of external factors derived from the market and adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the cash-generating units. Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the different cash-generating units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no necessity for an impairment to any cash-generating unit. F-286 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Other non-current provisions (Continued),173.219.1,,"For German Group companies, pension obligations developed as follows: The fair value of plan assets underlying the pension obligations developed as follows for German group companies: Expenses for defined benefit plans amounted to net expenses in the total amount of A 5.3 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 4.0 million) and consisted of the following components: pension obligations (DBO) for German Group companies is presented according to a change in the discount rate, salary trends and pension trends: the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a pension fund. As of December 31, 2017, plan assets amounted to A 42.5 million and were composed of three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans. In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany, as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally. Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development and the risk that the real future salary development exceeds the salary development derived from assumptions taken in the evaluation. The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff was transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the future. Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands is, in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement or early death. In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2017, plan assets amounted to A 26.3 million. The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future contributions received. Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the insurance, the company could be required to pay an additional contribution payment. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations and plan assets, the assumptions of the AG forecast table 2016 were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality. Company-specific age-related annual fluctuation rates serve as a fluctuation assumption. In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees with defined benefit plans that are concluded for new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension plan plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator. The pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations. F-300 ----- In the long-term, 40% of the plan assets in the United Kingdom should be invested in so-called matching assets, which guarantee the fulfillment of future pension obligations under changing market conditions. In accordance with target allocation, the remaining 60% should be invested in so-called growth assets, for which an above-average return is expected in comparison with the obligation development. As of December 31, 2017, plan assets amounted to A 23.5 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table CMI 2015 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are no longer relevant for the pension plan. In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan according to federal pension law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to A 26.8 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 23.2 million).

A review in 2017 showed that the plan participants could interpret the closing regulation in a way that would mean that the connection of the payments to the salary development was still in place.

The reduction in income of plan assets for German Group companies is mainly due to an increase of the plan assets of an approval to the level of the gross obligation as a result of existing reinsurance; this decreased as a consequence of the increased actuarial interest rate in financial year 2017. The reduction of the plan assets outside Germany is mainly attributable to a worse performance of the plan assets in the United Kingdom and a decrease in the income of the plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the amount of the plan assets is calculated on the basis of an actuarial measurement and thus depends decisively on the development of the actuarial interest rate. In financial year 2017, the actuarial interest rate increased; this led to a reduction of the plan assets and the income.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the company. For the STADA Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 83%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these countries. In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension plans. Regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees.

Notes to the cash flow statement",173.281.1,,"Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure, financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from operating activities decreased to A 262.9 million in the reporting year (previous year: A 333.5 million). This development resulted primarily from significantly higher cash outflows as compared with the previous year in connection with inventories, trade receivables as well as trade payables. The cash-effective increase in inventories was attributable, among other things, to additions at ALIUD PHARMA to secure the ability to deliver within the scope of health insurance tenders. In addition, trade receivables were strongly impacted by decreasing factoring volumes. Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from disposals. This amounted to A �122.6 million in the reporting year (previous year: A �171.8 million). In financial year 2017, payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A 70.2 million (previous year: A 76.1 million) were made, of which A 39.5 million (previous year: A 33.4 million) related to significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio. Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A 5.7 million (previous year: A 11.0 million) in the financial year. The cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by payments for investments in intangible assets in the financial year 2017, primarily relating to advance payments made for the development of approvals, trademarks and licence acquisitions in Germany and the United Kingdom. Within the scope of business combinations, there were pay-outs for the final purchase price payment from the acquisition of the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier as well as for the acquisition of the Serbian pharmaceutical wholesaler Velexfarm and a Serbian product portfolio. In the previous year, there were significantly higher pay-outs for business combinations, mainly for the acquisition of a product portfolio in Serbia, the acquisition of the British Natures Aid and the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier.

The selling price was A 6 k and was paid in cash. Assets in the total amount of A 1.7 million and liabilities in the total amount of A 1.7 million were hereby disposed of. Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A �227.8 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 54.3 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. This development was particularly attributable to a significantly lower borrowing of funds compared with the comparable period in the previous year. The repayment and borrowing of funds in 2017 shown in the cash outflow from financing activities was effected by the following facts: the financing agreements stipulate a right of return for the bonds, promissory note loans or bank loans on the part of the respective investors in the case of a change of control and a change to STADA’s rating. Nidda Healthcare Holding AG (now Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH), as part of the takeover offer, agreed to provide STADA with financing for the financing amounts for which an early repayment of the STADA financing is upcoming. In 2017, a loan in the amount of A 40.0 million was already granted by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH in this connection. The resulting cash inflows were allocated to cash flow from financing activities. Dividend distribution payments at A 44.8 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2016. Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities amounted to A 140.2 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 161.8 million).

Thus, the allocation to the individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reallocated. According to the new reporting structure, which was introduced in the previous year, the Group is managed by operating segment, i.e. according to the two segments Generics and Branded Products. Generics are products for the health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two following criteria: - The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient F-307 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,727

Branded Products are products for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two following criteria: - The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and other Group products, or - the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and other Group products. All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be directly allocated to the segments, as well as the elimination of sales between segments are recognized under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and consolidation. Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not, however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance organization billings are included here.

The resulting possible obligations amounted to approx. A 11.6 million (previous year: A 12.9 million). Development as compared to the previous year are based primarily on the elimination of possible obligations from patent risks in the amount of A 4.6 million. Furthermore, a changed estimate with regard to the volume of impending resource outflows for patent risks that existed already in the previous year as well as potential obligations as a result of a ban on economic activities between Russia and Ukraine led to an increase in contingent liabilities in the amount of A 3.3 million.

Disclosures about financial instruments (Continued),173.305.1,,"Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade receivables mainly have short remaining terms, their carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to the fair value. Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of promissory note loans, bonds, as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the fair values for liabilities to credit institutes. Due to the short-term maturity of the promissory note loan, the stated fair value corresponds to the nominal value. Available-for-sale financial assets are primarily the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated investments which are entirely measured at amortized cost for lack of available market prices. The fair values of remaining financial receivables as well as of held-to-maturity financial investments with remaining terms of more than a year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade payables as well as remaining financial liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair values. For the disclosures according to class of financial instrument necessary in accordance with IFRS 7, STADA defines each valuation category as a class. The chart below shows how the valuation rates of financial instruments measured at fair value were determined for the respective classes of financial instruments: determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties. STADA designates currency forwards (EUR/RUB), (EUR/DKK), (EUR/CHF), (EUR/USD) and (EUR/ GBP) as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company loans. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective. The chart below shows how the valuation rates of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis were determined: Financial assets and liabilities allocated to hierarchy level 3 and recognized at fair value developed as follows in financial year 2017: on the reporting date.

Due to the international alignment of business activities, STADA is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations. On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk). However, STADA is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters risks from currency related fluctuations through, alongside natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, STADA made use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures contracts are thereby selected to match the Company’s anticipated cash flows. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year. In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally negative and depreciation is generally positive. STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective Group company’s functional currency.
