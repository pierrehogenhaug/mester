-----

You are reminded that the offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a
person into whose possession the offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the
laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the
offering memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires
that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and an Initial Purchaser or any affiliate of an
Initial Purchaser (as defined in the offering memorandum) is a licensed broker or dealer in that
jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by such Initial Purchaser or such affiliate on behalf of
Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Issuer’’) in such jurisdiction. Under no
circumstances shall the offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to
buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or
sale would be unlawful.

The offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is
for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments
(being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’)), (ii) are persons
falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (‘‘high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.’’) of the
Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation
or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as ‘‘relevant
persons’’). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or
relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. No part of this offering memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or
otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which
Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (as defined in the attached offering
memorandum), nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of the
foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference
between the offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy version
available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

**Professional investors and ECPs only target market:** Solely for the purposes of the product approval
process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this
offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible
counterparties (‘‘ECPs’’) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA or United Kingdom retail investors:** The securities described in the attached
offering memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not
be made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering
or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation.

## Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH
#### E200,000,000 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024


Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH, a Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung organized under the laws of Germany (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Issuer’’), is
offering (the ‘‘Offering’’) A200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’). The proceeds
from the Offering will be used as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

On the New Issue Date (as defined below), the Additional Notes will be issued pursuant to the indenture dated as of September 29, 2017 (as amended and
supplemented from time to time, the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Indenture’’), entered into between, among others, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, as issuer,
and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’), governing the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s existing A1,685,000,000 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured
Notes due 2024 (the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured Notes’’). The Additional Notes will have the same terms and conditions (other than issue price) as the
Existing Senior Secured Notes and will constitute a single class of securities with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for all purposes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions, and offers to purchase. However, we expect that the
Additional Notes will be issued with more than de minimis original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) and will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as a result will be issued with separate common codes and International Securities Identification Numbers from
those assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes.’’ Unless indicated otherwise, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes and the Additional Notes are referred to collectively in this offering memorandum as the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes.’’

The Additional Notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum and will mature on September 30, 2024. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will pay
interest on the Additional Notes semi-annually in arrears on each of March 30 and September 30, commencing on September 30, 2020. Interest on the
Additional Notes will be deemed to have accrued from March 30, 2020.

All or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to September 30, 2020, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date and the applicable ‘‘make whole’’ premium, as described in this offering memorandum. Prior to September 30, 2020, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may in each calendar year redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any additional notes)
at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date. The Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after September 30, 2020, at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum. At any time prior to September 30, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes may be
redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103.50% plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date,
provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding after the redemption, with the net
proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings. All of the Senior Secured Notes may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain changes in
applicable tax law. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, or any third-party making such tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such holders, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third-party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that
remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of such Senior Secured
Notes. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred
if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with, or upon signing of a definitive agreement in respect of, such event.

On the New Issue Date, the Additional Notes will be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (as defined herein), as further described in this
offering memorandum. See ‘‘The Offering—Guarantors’’ and ‘‘—Ranking of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.’’

On the New Issue Date, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees
(as defined herein) thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (as defined herein). The
Senior Secured Notes Collateral also secures the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) and certain
hedging obligations on a first-priority basis. A portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral also secures the Senior Notes (as defined herein) on a
second-priority basis. See ‘‘The Offering—Collateral.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the security and the
liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain limitations. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior_
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

There is currently no public market for the Additional Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
‘‘Authority’’) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’).
There can be no assurance, however, that the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the
Additional Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of
Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended.
**Investing in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 29.**

**Issue Price:** **% plus accrued interest, if any, from March 30, 2020.**


**None of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof have been, or will be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as**
**amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Additional Notes may not be offered or sold within the United**
**States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by**
**Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S.**
**Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’). You are hereby notified that sellers of the Additional Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of**
**Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See ‘‘Notice to Certain Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ for additional information about**
**eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.**

Delivery of the Additional Notes will be made in book-entry form through a common depositary of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (‘‘Euroclear’’) and
Clearstream Banking S.A. (‘‘Clearstream’’). The Additional Notes are expected to be delivered to investors on or about, 2020 (the ‘‘New
Issue Date’’). The Additional Notes will be in registered form in minimum denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 above A100,000.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any other
regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the Additional Notes or the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees, and none of the foregoing authorities have passed upon or endorsed the merits of the
Offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary
could be a criminal offense in certain jurisdictions.

Each purchaser of the Additional Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this offering memorandum under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The
Additional Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities
laws of any state of the United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. Prospective
purchasers are hereby notified that the seller of any note may be relying on the exemption from the
provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of certain
further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Additional Notes, see ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**Canada**

The Additional Notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45 106 Prospectus Exemptions or
subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National
Instrument 31 103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any
resale of the Additional Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser
within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The
purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province
or territory for particulars of these rights, or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to Section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33 105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33 105), the Initial
Purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33 105 regarding
underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this Offering.

**EEA**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Additional Notes in any
Member State of the EEA or the United Kingdom that is subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the
‘‘Prospectus Regulation’’) (each, a ‘‘Relevant Member State’’) will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Additional
Notes. The expression ‘‘Prospectus Regulation’’ means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the prospectus to be
published when the securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading.

**_Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Additional Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Additional
Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Additional Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Additional Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA or UK Retail Investors_**

The Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For

v


-----

these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended or superseded, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering
or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the
United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

**Belgium**

The Additional Notes are not offered, directly or indirectly, to the public in Belgium. The Additional
Notes are being offered in Belgium to qualified investors only, within the meaning of the Prospectus
Regulation. Accordingly, this offering memorandum has not been and will not be notified to, or approved

memorandum and any other information, circular, brochure or similar documents may not be distributed,
directly or indirectly, in Belgium other than to said qualified investors.

Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f¨ur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (‘‘BaFin’’). BaFin has not obtained

Union (each a Member State), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to
Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The Additional Notes must not be distributed within Germany by
way of a public offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and
any other document relating to the Additional Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be
supplied to the public in Germany or used in connection with any offer for subscription of Additional

No. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about market
consolidation and our strategy, investment program, future operations, industry forecasts, expected
acquisitions, transactions and investments, and target levels of leverage and indebtedness. Forward-looking
statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking
statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and
other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as ‘‘anticipate,’’
‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘continue,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘may,’’ ‘‘ongoing,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘potential,’’ ‘‘predict,’’
‘‘project,’’ ‘‘seek,’’ ‘‘target’’ or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may
identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a
statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on
potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected
or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those
expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in ‘‘Risk
_Factors.’’ In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements_
contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or
developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from
projected future results include, but are not limited to:

- our highly competitive industry;

- extensive governmental regulation and changes in these regulations, or our failure to comply with
regulations;

- changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory factors which are
beyond our control;

- existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities or
government-sponsored healthcare systems;

- failure to obtain necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products;

- failure to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new Generics products in a timely
manner;

- the risk of litigation and other claims, including with respect to the infringement of third parties
proprietary rights and disputes with other STADA shareholders;

- the risk of industrial action or adverse labor relations;

- reputational issues due to product liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived;

- acceptance of the products by end-users and independent third parties, including public health
insurers, doctors and pharmacists;

- problems in manufacturing products;

- potential significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt-on acquisitions;

- disruption of our operations due to accidents, equipment malfunctioning or other unexpected events;

- accidental contamination, non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or
environmental, health and safety litigation or liability;

- our failure to renew agreements with material suppliers and wholesale customers on acceptable terms
or the termination of such agreements;

- changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems leading to delivery bottlenecks or
unintentional increase in inventories;

- significant increases in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our
products or lack of their availability;

- risks associated with cross-border sales and purchases;

- risks related to conducting operations in several different countries;

viii


-----

- pricing adjustments of cross-border transactions leading to greater or double taxation of profits;

- risks of national and international sanctions affecting Russia, in which we operate manufacturing
facilities and sales entities and have significant sales;

- international sanctions, including economic and trade sanctions imposed by the European Union and
other jurisdictions, affecting our international sales and operations, including in Russia;

- the result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union;

- the potential decline of our sales and profits from generic pharmaceutical products as a result of
competition, both from other pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental
pricing pressure;

- undesirable side effects or other properties of our products that delay or prevent their regulatory
approval or limit their commercial potential;

- counterfeit versions of our products;

- the termination of licenses from third-party pharmaceutical companies;

- our inability to retain key personnel;

- a breakdown in our information technology systems;

- our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal data;

- default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of contracting
parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations;

- risks related to potential negative long-term health effects of vaping products use;

- fluctuations in exchange rates;

- transfer price risks;

- impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;

- operating risks, including natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, terrorism and other criminal
activities;

- any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken
in response thereto;

- changes to the composition of the Eurozone;

- defaults under certain other indebtedness of STADA as a result of the grant of security in favor of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities;

- our inability to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings; and

- other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors.’’

These risks and others described under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering
memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of
operations and liquidity. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all
such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or
combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering
memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering
memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, all industry and market data in this offering memorandum, including
information regarding market sizes, market shares, market growth rates, market trends and competition in
the markets in which we operate, speak as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2019, as applicable. Any
forward-looking statements contained in such industry and market data were made prior to the outbreak of
the Covid-19 pandemic and have not been updated to account for the impact of such outbreak. There can
be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have been materially different if the
Covid-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements.’’

We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry. In certain cases, it is difficult in
this sector to obtain precise market, economic and industry information. Certain information used in this
offering memorandum has been obtained from IQVIA Holdings, Inc. (formerly, Quintiles IMS
Holdings, Inc.) (‘‘IQVIA’’), a leading information, services and technology company. In particular,
information obtained from IQVIA includes descriptions of the pharmaceutical markets in certain
geographies and details of the Group’s market share and competitive position, which may be based on
manufacturer or pharmacy sales and volume or value. In addition, certain information regarding industry
benchmarks and potential cost savings have been obtained by the Sponsors (as defined herein) from a
leading global consulting firm.

None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers
accepts responsibility for the factual correctness of any such statistics or information obtained from third
parties. While the Senior Secured Notes Issuer believes this information to be reliable, it has not been
independently verified, and we do not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum. Market data and statistics are
inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions.
Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by
both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and
transactions should be included in the relevant market. Additionally, industry publications and reports
from management consultants generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained
from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information. We cannot
therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have not independently
verified such information.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

The Group owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it uses in
connection with the operation of its business. The Group asserts, to the fullest extent under applicable law,
its rights to its trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of
any other company appearing in this offering memorandum belongs to its holder.

memorandum are listed without the TM, � and � symbols.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

This offering memorandum includes the historical financial statements listed below (together, our
‘‘Financial Statements’’):

- the audited consolidated financial statements of German Topco as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, which are presented in accordance with IFRS and the
supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315(e)(1) of the HGB, including the auditor’s report
thereon (the ‘‘Topco Financial Statements’’); and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of STADA as of and for the years ended December 31,
2017 and 2018, which are presented in accordance with IFRS and the supplementary provisions
pursuant to Section 315(e)(1) of the HGB, including the auditor’s report thereon (the ‘‘STADA
Financial Statements’’).

German Topco has consolidated STADA and its subsidiaries since August 22, 2017, when it indirectly
acquired control over STADA pursuant to the Takeover Offer and, as a result, the financial information of
German Topco for 2017 covers only the stub period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Prior to
completion of the STADA Acquisition, none of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or German Topco had any material assets or liabilities (other than nominal share capital) or conducted any
operations. As a result, in order to compare twelve months of operations for all the periods presented in
this offering memorandum, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we have included in this
offering memorandum the consolidated financial statements of STADA and for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2019, we have included in this offering memorandum the consolidated financial
Statements of German Topco.

We have included in this offering memorandum the consolidated financial statements of German Topco
instead of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, because we report our consolidated financial condition and
results of operations on an ongoing basis at the level of German Topco. The notes to German Topco’s
consolidated financial statements include reconciliation columns to the consolidated financial statements
of each of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In the ‘‘Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information,’’ ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial Information’’ and_
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ sections of this
offering memorandum, we have presented the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe that this presentation is more useful to investors than
presenting the financial information of German Topco because such presentation excludes additional
interest expense and liabilities outside the perimeter of the restricted group of the Senior Notes Issuer. In
this offering memorandum, we present the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer, as opposed to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, because the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer reflects the
Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Notes, which we believe provides a more meaningful
illustration of the Group’s capital structure.

The comparability of the STADA Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements (including the
reconciliation to the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s consolidated financial
information contained therein) may be limited. For example, certain consultancy costs related to the
STADA Acquisition were incurred by German Topco and the Issuers. Furthermore, only a portion of the
debt incurred by the Issuers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement in connection with the
STADA Acquisition was on-lent to STADA to refinance its STADA Existing Debt. In addition, German
Topco incurred substantial liabilities under deeply-subordinated shareholder funding instruments the
proceeds of which were ultimately passed on as equity funding to the Senior Notes Issuer as the Sponsors’
equity contribution in connection with the STADA Acquisition. As a result, there may be material
differences in the amount of liabilities, financial results, income taxes and earnings reflected in the STADA
Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements.

German Topco and the Issuers accounted for the STADA Acquisition, and will account for the recent
acquisitions of the Takeda CIS Assets and Walmark, using the acquisition method of accounting under
IFRS. Under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), the consideration transferred in an acquisition is measured
as the fair value of the assets transferred by the acquirer on the date of the acquisition, any liabilities
incurred by the acquirer to the former owners of the target and any equity interests issued by the acquirer,
including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except for deferred costs related to the acquisition of

xvi


-----

debt or equity securities. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests in the target over the identifiable net
assets on the acquisition date is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with IFRS, we had a measurement
period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation for the
STADA Acquisition. While we allocated the purchase price of the STADA Acquisition on a preliminary
basis in the audited consolidated financial statements of German Topco for the period from April 18, 2017
to December 31, 2017, the other financial information of German Topco included in this offering
memorandum reflects the final purchase price allocation. As a result, the audited consolidated financial
statements of German Topco for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017, are not directly
comparable with the other financial information of German Topco included in this offering memorandum
and German Topco’s financial statements for future periods.

The application of the purchase price allocation of the STADA Acquisition resulted in different carrying
values for certain assets and certain liabilities and therefore further affects the comparability of the Topco
Financial Statements and the STADA Financial Statements. The STADA Financial Statements have not
been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, statement of financial position
or statement of cash flows that might have occurred as a result of purchase price allocation adjustments to
be applied due to the STADA Acquisition and ancillary transactions. In the section of this offering
memorandum entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations’’ we have discussed the results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer (as derived from the_
Topco Financial Statements) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and STADA (as derived
from the STADA Financial Statements) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. We believe this
discussion is more meaningful than comparing the results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer to those
of STADA.

The financial information of STADA as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, which has
been included in this offering memorandum, has been taken or derived from the STADA Financial
Statements or from accounting records or internal management reporting systems of STADA. The
financial information of German Topco as of and for the period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017
and the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, which has been included in this offering memorandum,
has been taken or derived from the Topco Financial Statements or from accounting records or internal
management reporting systems of German Topco.

With effect as of January 1, 2018, we have adopted new standards for revenue recognition in accordance
with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and the recognition of financial instruments in
accordance with IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments). See note 3 to the STADA Financial Statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this offering memorandum.

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On
January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, we
recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘‘operating leases’’
under the principles of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases.’’ We recognized a right-of-use asset representing our right to use
the underlying asset and a lease liability representing our obligation to make lease payments. We elected to
apply the modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16, and as such the cumulative effect of
initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, January 1, 2019. The
adoption of IFRS 16 had an impact on our balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. In
implementing IFRS 16, the Topco Financial Statements have been prepared under the modified
retrospective approach pursuant to which the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was
recognized at the date of initial application, January 1, 2019. As a result, the comparability of our income
statement information between these periods is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1,
2019, resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets and a
decrease of rent expense on operating leases. In addition, the comparability of our balance sheet
information between these dates is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, resulted
in an increase in current and non-current other financial liabilities. To facilitate a comparison of our results
of operations and financial condition across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease accounting
standard, we present additional information under ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information.’’ See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting_

_Standards—IFRS 16’’ and the Topco Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this_
offering memorandum.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, each of German Topco, German Midco, the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding, management and finance company with no
business operations of its own. The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material assets consist of its indirect interest
in STADA’s share capital and intercompany loans to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The Senior Notes
Issuer’s only material liabilities consist of the obligations under the Senior Notes and deeply-subordinated
shareholder loans. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s only material assets consists of its indirect interests
in STADA’s share capital and intercompany loans to German Holdco (if any). The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s only material liabilities consist of the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. German Topco’s only material assets consist of its indirect interest in STADA’s
share capital and intercompany loans to its direct subsidiary, German Midco. German Topco’s only
material liabilities consist of the obligations under shareholder loans owed to its immediate parent
company, Nidda MidCo S.`a r.l.

This offering memorandum includes certain financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019, presented at the level of the Senior Notes Issuer, on an adjusted basis to give pro
forma effect to the Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom and certain other transactions
as described in ‘‘Capitalization,’’ including financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the Offering
and such transactions on the Issuers’ indebtedness as if the Offering and such transactions had occurred on
December 31, 2019, and on the Senior Notes Issuer’s interest expense as if the Offering and such
transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The pro forma financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2019, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what
the Issuers’ indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Offering and certain other
transactions as described in ‘‘Capitalization’’ occurred on December 31, 2019, or January 1, 2019,
respectively; nor does it purport to project the Issuers’ financial results, indebtedness or interest expense at
any future date. The pro forma financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, has
not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards or in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or
any other regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. Neither the
assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2019, have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

When calculating sales by country as presented in this offering memorandum, we allocate sales to the
country in which the invoice recipient is located.

We present certain financial information in this offering memorandum for our two operational divisions,
our Generics division and our Branded Products division. The Topco Financial Statements do not present
the financial data of these divisions. We present divisional financial information in this offering
memorandum as we believe it provides useful information to investors about our business.
See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating
_Divisions.’’_

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

**_General_**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of
the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary Non-GAAP financial measures used in this
offering memorandum include Adjusted Capital Expenditures, Adjusted Cash Conversion, Adjusted Free
Cash Flow, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit, adjusted sales, capital expenditures, constantcurrency sales, Earnings Before Taxes, EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBITDA (before leases), Gross
Profit, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA margin, Management
Normalized EBITDA, Net Working Capital, operating profit and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (our
‘‘Non-GAAP Measures’’). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this
offering memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated Net
Income’’ and ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ presented in the Indentures.

xviii


-----

Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows:

- ‘‘Adjusted Capital Expenditures’’ is defined as capital expenditures (as defined below), excluding
payments for significant investments and acquisitions;

- ‘‘Adjusted Cash Conversion’’ is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Management Adjusted
EBITDA (as defined below);

- ‘‘Adjusted Free Cash Flow’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), less
Adjusted Capital Expenditures (as defined above). The definition of ‘‘Adjusted Free Cash Flow’’ used
in the Financial Statements for regular reporting purposes differs from the definition of Adjusted Free
Cash Flow used in this offering memorandum;

- ‘‘adjusted net income’’ is defined as net income, adjusted for special items;

- ‘‘adjusted operating profit’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, investment income and
result from investments measured at equity, adjusted for certain special items;

- ‘‘adjusted sales’’ is defined as sales, adjusted for currency effects and portfolio changes;

- ‘‘capital expenditures’’ is defined as total capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment and financial assets as well as business combinations according to IFRS 3;

- ‘‘constant-currency sales’’ is defined as sales, adjusted so that all of our non-euro denominated sales
are translated into euro at the same constant exchange rate in all periods presented;

- ‘‘Earnings Before Taxes’’ is defined as net income before income taxes;

- ‘‘EBIT’’ is defined as net income before interest and taxes;

- ‘‘EBITDA’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment
losses;

- ‘‘EBITDA margin’’ is defined as EBITDA divided by sales;

- ‘‘EBITDA (before leases)’’ is defined as earnings before interest (including interest expense on lease
liabilities), taxes, depreciation (including depreciation of lease assets in connection with leases),
amortization, impairment losses and rent expense;

- ‘‘Gross Profit’’ is defined as sales less cost of sales;

- ‘‘Management Adjusted EBITDA’’ is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items.
Management Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum is titled ‘‘EBITDA,
adjusted’’ in the STADA Financial Statements;

- ‘‘Management Adjusted EBITDA margin’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA divided by
sales. Management Adjusted EBITDA margin as presented in this offering memorandum is titled
‘‘adjusted EBITDA margin’’ in the STADA Financial Statements;

- ‘‘Management Normalized EBITDA’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for
certain normalization adjustments;

- ‘‘Net Working Capital’’ is defined as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables;

- ‘‘operating profit’’ is defined as net income before interest, taxes, investment income and result from
investments measured at equity; and

- ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA’’ is defined as Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain
Sponsor-identified adjustments and expected cost savings. These adjustments and cost savings have
been determined solely by the Senior Notes Issuer as further described in the offering memorandum
and should not be attributed to STADA.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by
factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and
capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA (before leases),
Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations
being evaluated. By eliminating certain effects that affect the comparability between periods, we believe
adjusted sales, constant-currency sales, operating profit and adjusted operating profit enhance investors’

xix


-----

understanding of our underlying operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures presented by other companies. We believe a presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted
Cash Conversion, net working capital, capital expenditures and Adjusted Capital Expenditures is useful to
investors to assess our liquidity. For these reasons, we believe that our Non-GAAP Measures and similar
measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as
supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS
and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles. Each of our Non-GAAP Measures is defined and
reconciled to its closest comparable IFRS measure under ‘‘Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information.’’ Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of_
other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of
Non-GAAP Measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
income statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on
our Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our
performance.

**_Constant-currency Sales_**

We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of
operations attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into
euro, using average exchange rates as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering
memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under IFRS, but also on a constant-currency basis
using the Non-GAAP Measure titled constant-currency sales. Constant-currency sales removes the
distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro
denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We
believe that this measure facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of our
operations. Our constant-currency sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, are
computed by translating the actual values of our non-euro denominated sales as per our subsidiaries’
financial statements using the following adjusted foreign exchange rates instead of the actual foreign

(1) Each constant foreign exchange rate presented in this column was used in calculating constant-currency sales. Each rate is equal
to the actual average foreign exchange rate to euro of the corresponding currency during the 90 days ended April 16, 2020.

**_Adjusted Sales_**

We also report the Non-GAAP Measure adjusted sales which is defined as sales, adjusted for currency
effects and portfolio changes. The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact
of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability between periods. In calculating this adjustment
in each period, we use the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative prior period to translate our
non-euro denominated sales in euro. The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like
adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and divestments of companies and significant
products. In calculating this adjustment in each period, we only take into account the organic sales
generated by products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

In the section entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Results of Operations,’’ we provide a tabular reconciliation for each period between adjusted_
sales and reported sales, its closest comparable IFRS measure. Each such reconciliation table also shows
the comparative data for the previous period. Investors should note that such comparative data is solely
meant to illustrate the comparative basis for the later period and differs from the actual adjusted sales data
for the previous period.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in
million or thousand and percentage terms, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the
totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. In addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented
in tabular form may differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using the
unrounded financial information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating
to financial and other data set forth in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations’’ are calculated using the numerical data in the STADA Financial Statements_
contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative
description thereof.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

We publish our Financial Statements in euro. The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth
below, the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) expressed as
U.S. dollars per A1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ‘‘best market’’ calculation, in which, at any
point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask
rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value
rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The below rates may differ from the
actual rates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and other financial information appearing
in this offering memorandum. We make no representation that the euro or U.S. dollar amounts referred to
in this offering memorandum have been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted into U.S.
dollars or euro, as the case may be, at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last business day
of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of
the daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the euro on April 29, 2020 was $1.0848 per A1.00.

**Overview**

We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on branded and
unbranded generics, with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 30,000 SKUs
covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product
portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries
and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA
region, Asia, South America and Australia.

We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales and we ranked ninth among OTC companies in Europe
as of December 31, 2019. Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is
bolstered by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local
market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective
manufacturing footprint comprising 21 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building on our
tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each year since 2014.
Our solid pipeline of new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a
strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our
business and further improve our profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, we generated sales of A2,608.6 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of
A885.3 million.

The products we sell are classified according to two divisions: Generics and Branded Products.

_Generics:_ Within our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost
alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in
our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and
hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with
competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations of originator
drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels
and local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics
division is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 18% of sales in our Generics division
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling products (and their respective therapeutic
areas) in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Epoetin zeta (anemia),
Tilidine, Tilidine/Naloxone (pain), Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Omeprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux),
Pantoprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Diclofenac (pain, anti-inflammatory), Paracetamol (pain), Bisoprolol
(high blood-pressure), Amoxi-Clavulan (antibiotic), Fentanyl (analgesic). The largest countries by sales in
our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia,
Russia, France and Switzerland. We generated sales of A1,534.7 million and Management Adjusted
EBITDA of A439.3 million in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products division primarily includes branded OTC products, which are
typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests,
cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands
include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-go (Parkinson’s disease).
The market for products in our Branded Products division is generally characterized by market-driven
pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty being important factors for success.
Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 37% of
sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling brands
(and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in
our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Bortezomib (anti-cancer

medication, prescription required multiple myeloma), APO-go (Parkinson’s disease, prescription required,
available in 28 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in 28 countries), Zoflora (household
disinfection), Snup (rhinitis), Aqualor (rhinitis, sore throats, available in 18 countries), Nizoral
(anti-dandruff shampoo), Hirudoid (anti-coagulant), Vitaprost (prostate diseases) and Versatis (local
anesthetic). The largest countries by sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended
December 31, 2019, were: Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Italy. We
generated sales of A1,073.9 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A298.0 million in our Branded
Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Our Strengths**

**_Organic Growth Underpinned by Attractive Market Fundamentals and Bolt-on Acquisitions_**

Increasing demand for our Generics and Branded Products is driven by global growth factors in the
pharmaceutical industry, including population growth, aging societies, increased incidences of chronic
disease, advances in medical therapies and increasing self-medication and health awareness. According to
IQVIA, the global generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2020 to 2024, driven by
these growth trends and increasing generics penetration. Generics penetration in the market for
prescription products is partly driven by cost containment regulation that incentivizes the use of generics to
counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs. Another key driver
of generics penetration is patent expirations. According to publicly available estimates, a wave of patent
expirations in developed markets is expected to push originator products with sales of more than
$12.2 billion in aggregate into the generics market between 2019 and the end of 2022.

Given that our Branded Products division consists mostly of OTC products, growth in this division is
additionally driven by factors influencing the self-payment and self-care market for health and well-being
related products. We expect demand for self-payment and self-care products to benefit from the ongoing
trend among regulators to transfer prescription drugs to OTC status, which decreases the cost burden on
the public health system and expands market opportunity for companies such as us that offer branded
OTC products. Additionally, demand for OTC products is expected to be driven by rising income levels
and the emerging trend toward greater health awareness, which we believe results from ongoing research
on disease prevention, data access and increasing levels of education. According to IQVIA, the global
OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2020 to 2024.

In addition to our organic growth, we have a strong record of growth through focused acquisitions. In 2019,
we acquired from GlaxoSmithKline five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, as well
as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and expanded our footprint in Eastern Europe and Asia
through our acquisitions of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in
Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals
in the Philippines (the ‘‘Fern C Acquisition’’), to bolster our presence in Asia following the disposal of our
Vietnamese joint venture. Furthermore, we agreed to acquire the existing customer portfolio of Opti
Pharm AG (the ‘‘Opti Pharm Acquisition’’), a specialist in the trade and distribution of pharmaceutical
products in Switzerland, to expand our Swiss operations. Most recently, we acquired multiple, highly
recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the Takeda Acquisition and a leading OTC
and food supplement provider in Central Europe through the Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently
agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15
well-established consumer healthcare brands.

**_Well-Established Generics Player with Leading Positions in Our Generics Division and an Attractive Portfolio_**
**_in Our Branded Products Division with High Growth Potential Through Enhanced Internationalization_**

We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales in Europe as of December 31, 2019. In our Generics
division, based on IQVIA data for the year ended December 31, 2019, we held a top-three market share in
generics sales in Germany. We were also the fourth-largest player in Italy and the fourth-largest in Spain.
Moreover, in the year ended December 31, 2019, our Belgian Generics unit was the leader in the Belgian
market, and we ranked second among national manufacturers in the Russian Generics market. Even
though these markets are generally considered to be mature, there is significant room for increased
penetration (by value) and further growth in generics in these markets. For example, according to IQVIA,
generics penetration by sales value is below 30% in Belgium, 35% in Italy, 35% in Spain, and below 50% in
France and 45% in Germany. The generics industry in Germany, Spain and Russia is expected to increase
by a CAGR of 5.4%, 7.9% and 9.2% from 2020 to 2024, respectively. Continued growth in the generics

-----

industry in countries where we are already market leaders provides us with an opportunity to continue to
grow sales in our Generics division.

We also benefit from an attractive portfolio of products in our Branded Products division, including
category-leading therapies for cough and cold, medical skin care sun protection, vitamin deficiencies and
many leading brands across therapeutic areas in Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and other
countries. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 75% of sales of our top 30 products in
our Branded Products division were of products with a top-three market position in their respective
countries. Many of these leading products have been category leaders in their respective markets for many
years, providing us with an opportunity to leverage our local marketing expertise to drive the
internationalization of these leading brands into new markets and further grow sales in our Branded
Products division.

**_Competitive Advantage Through Scale, Local Market Expertise and Established Relationships_**

Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage over new entrants in our markets,
bolstered by our scale and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and
established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies.

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated
in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a
new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement
regimes and distribution channels. This provides an advantage to existing, large-scale players with a long
history of local expertise, such as us. We are highly familiar with the regulatory requirements in our key
markets and have developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory and distribution issues, which
enables us to minimize the time and cost required to obtain regulatory product approvals while maximizing
the number of countries we cover.

Germany, for example, operates a public tender system that covers the majority of prescription generics
sales, which necessitates a modestly sized sales team with significant tender experience. In Russia, on the
other hand, the distribution of prescription generics products is mostly patient-driven after the first
prescription, which significantly increases the need for a larger sales force targeting patients indirectly via
doctors. Our local market experience means that we are adept at navigating these and other regimes and
are able to serve each market with a tailored sales and distribution approach. Building on our long history
and our origins as a pharmacy cooperative, we have developed deeply ingrained relationships with the key
distribution channels in our markets, which we believe are difficult to replicate. We successfully pursue
different business models tailored to local markets’ needs. Our sales forces are trained and experienced in
identifying the right marketing strategy for each country, and we maintain a direct sales presence in
approximately 30 countries, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors and
internationalize successful brands.

**_Diversified Across Geographic Areas, Therapeutic Areas, Products and Brands_**

We are diversified across geographic markets, products, therapeutic areas, customers and suppliers,
thereby limiting our exposure to any single product, geographic area and reimbursement system. We
market our products in approximately 120 countries with largely uncorrelated end-markets.

With more than 30,000 SKUs, we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and are not dependent on the
success of any single product. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the top-ten products by sales in our
Generics division accounted for only 18% of Generics sales, and the top-ten products in the Branded
Products division accounted for only 37% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering is diversified
across a large number of therapeutic areas and benefits from a high rate of new product launches, with a
strong pipeline for the next four to five years.

The combination of our Generics and Branded Products divisions provides us with significant benefits in
terms of diversification and synergies. The pricing of prescription generics is regulated, and volume
demand is relatively independent of economic conditions, such that our Generics business has historically
delivered strong and stable sales and cash generation. Our Branded Products division, on the other hand,
faces fewer regulatory requirements. OTC products can be brought to the market more quickly, and
pricing is unregulated and driven by competition. As a result, our highly recognizable brands, customer
loyalty and the lack of competition in certain specialty areas provide for attractive pricing for products in
our Branded Products division. Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond

3


-----

relatively quickly to emerging consumer trends. Our presence in both divisions allows us to deepen our
local market expertise and regulatory know-how; exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and
marketing; and maintain our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.

**_Diversified and Efficient Manufacturing Footprint Across the Globe_**

We have a cost-effective manufacturing footprint that is diversified across 21 manufacturing sites.
Furthermore, in 2019 approximately 71% of our production volume is manufactured in lower-cost
countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and
highly flexible production base.

Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and 15 of our sites are
required to comply with stringent EU standards and are EU certified plants. Moreover, local production
helps provide a natural hedge for currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an
advantage in the marketing of products in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage
our costs in order to increase our margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to
further streamline and improve certain aspects of our manufacturing operations.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Cash Flow Generation Reinforced by Successful Improvements in_**
**_Working Capital Management_**

We have a stable underlying business that has delivered consistent sales growth and resulted in high cash
flow generation in recent years. Our constant-currency sales increased at a CAGR of 7.0% from
December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2019. We had Adjusted Cash Conversion of 85% and 81% for the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although our Management Adjusted EBITDA
margins have already improved (22% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively), we see significant additional upside in our ability to drive cost savings and further increase
our margins. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements. We
have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital movements, and management has
maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a manufacturer of generics, we
typically incur limited development expenses and no material research expenses.

**_Highly Experienced Management Team Supported by Committed Sponsors_**

We have a highly experienced management team led by Peter Goldschmidt, who has been the Chief
Executive Officer of STADA since September 2018 and draws on over 29 years of experience in the
pharmaceutical industry. Having held various senior management positions in Europe, Asia and the
United States for the Novartis Group, Mr. Goldschmidt also served as the President of Sandoz USA and
the Head of North America at Sandoz, where he rapidly expanded the company’s generics and biosimilar
business, generating revenues of over $3 billion. He was also the global executive member for Central and
Eastern Europe for Sandoz, leading Sandoz to a top ranking market position in generics and rapidly
growing its OTC business. On February 1, 2020, Wolfgang Ollig joined our senior management team as our
new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ollig has more than 15 years of experience as group chief financial officer
in various industries, including medical, automotive and biotech. Most recently, Mr. Ollig served as chief
financial officer of WSA A.S, a Danish company under private equity ownership that is the global leader in
hearing aid manufacturing, with more than 10,000 employees and headquarters in Copenhagen and
Singapore. Mr. Ollig has significant experience in capital markets transactions, having led automotive
supplier Hella as chief financial officer in its 2014 initial public offering. Our leadership team also includes
Miguel Pagan Fernandez who was appointed Chief Technological Officer of STADA on July 1, 2018,
having previously served as the Head of Global Technical Operations (Solids and Special Technologies) of
Novartis. In addition to our senior executive team, our business benefits from experienced and dedicated
operational teams with a deep understanding of the healthcare and generics markets. Our management
team has successfully grown our business to become the fifth-largest generics company in Europe and
increased our sales from A2,330.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, to A2,608.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 2019, through both organic growth and a number of strategic bolt-on
acquisitions.

Since the STADA Acquisition in August 2017, we also draw from the market expertise, business
relationships, knowledge and experience of our Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors
have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive and successful track record of investing in companies in
the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital increased sales by 49% within two years and significantly

4


-----

increased the workforce at Bio Products Laboratory, creating a life sciences champion in the United
Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large laboratory diagnostics companies, Synlab (Germany) and
Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form Synlab Group (headquartered in Germany), the European
champion in laboratory diagnostics. In addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury Pharma and
Amdipharm, and merged the two businesses to create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented generics
market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy centered on continued buy and build, further
internationalization and applying best practice across both companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to
TSX/Nasdaq listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion in 2015. Most recently, Cinven has acquired
LGC, a global leader in the life sciences sector. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving
cost savings and improvements in margins, while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both
organically and through targeted acquisitions. Our recent revenue and profitability growth was driven by
the Transformation Program that the Sponsors are implementing at STADA, which contributed to the
significant increase in our EBITDA margin from 19% in the year ended December 31, 2018, to 22% in the
year ended December 31, 2019.

**Our Strategy**

We and the Sponsors have developed the following strategies:

**_Maintain and Grow Market-Leading Positions by Leveraging Scale, Highly Recognizable Brands and Industry_**
**_Growth Factors_**

As an established market leader, we intend to continue to use our scale and highly recognizable brands to
reinforce and grow our leading market positions in the key countries and categories in which we operate.
We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from global growth factors in the pharmaceutical
industry, and as a large player highly diversified across geographic region, products, brands and
production, we intend to continue to leverage our scale and broad local expertise to support our base
business, improve our margins and expand our geographic footprints along with the markets in which we
operate.

**_Selectively Consider Accretive Acquisition Opportunities_**

We have a strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and we intend
to continue this growth in the future, as evidenced by both the Takeda Acquisition and the Walmark
Acquisition which we estimate have a combined EBITDA multiple of 8.5x (based on an estimated
combined synergized EBITDA of A80.9 million).

Examples of our most recent acquisitions include our acquisition of five skincare brands and a pediatric
cough remedy in Europe and selected markets in APAC and Latin America from GlaxoSmithKline, our
acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine, our
acquisition of the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals in the
Philippines, our acquisition of the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland, our
acquisition or multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the Takeda
Acquisition our acquisition of a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe through
the Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from
GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands.

We intend to continue to selectively explore strategic acquisitions in the global generics and OTC markets,
with a focus on targets and/or pharmaceutical assets that allow us to utilize our existing platform and
realize meaningful synergies.

**_Continue to Grow Our Business, Including by Internationalizing Successful Brands in Our Branded Products_**
**_Division_**

The products in our Generics division comprise our core business, providing us with a stable sales base and
strong cash generation. We see significant potential to expand sales growth in this division by expanding in
markets with relatively low penetration rates and supplementing our existing portfolio with biosimilars,
while also benefiting from global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry.

At the same time, we intend to build on our key brands and to grow our Branded Products division by
strengthening our market shares in our existing geographic region and introducing our local category
leaders into new, international markets. Our intention is to continue to gradually increase the percentage

5


-----

of sales and EBITDA generated by our Branded Products division. In addition, we plan to continue
developing products for specialty areas, which tend to benefit from attractive pricing, to further expand the
scope and improve the profitability of our Branded Products division.

**_Increase Profitability by Continuing and Expanding upon Management’s Strategic Cost Savings Initiatives_**

In the last quarter of 2017, our management established a transformation program to improve our
operating efficiency and profitability (the ‘‘Transformation Program’’). The Transformation Program
targeted aggregate run-rate cost savings of more than A200 million by the end of 2021, which we aimed to
realize through a number of strategic cost saving initiatives. Having commenced the initial implementation
phase of the Transformation Program at the end of 2017, we had realized (i) approximately A52.0 million of
cumulative cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (ii) approximately A108.8 million of
cumulative cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2019. We are continuing the rollout of our
Transformation Program and believe we are currently on track to realize additional incremental cost
savings of approximately A45.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2020, which would bring our
cumulative cost savings to A154.5 million. In addition, we expect cost savings of approximately A3.0 million
in IT, the majority of which we expect to realize within the next 18 months, resulting in incremental cost
savings of approximately A48.7 million. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements’’ and ‘‘—Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.’’_

In terms of cost of sales, management has put in place initiatives to improve direct product procurement by
renegotiating supply contracts with our highly fragmented supply base and to create operational
improvements in manufacturing through insourcing certain third-party manufactured products and
streamlining product lines, while also improving our supply chain setup and organization through hub,
route and order size optimization. For general and administrative expenses, we believe we can achieve cost
savings by unifying our IT landscape across our footprint through consolidating IT systems and contracts,
reducing non-personnel general and administrative spending, and optimizing advisory and supervisory
board costs, while also optimizing our sales force structures by streamlining our legal entities. In the year
ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately A32 million to implement the Transformation
Program and develop a five-year strategy for the implementation of future cost saving measures. Our
additional cost saving measures target our cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses,
and research and development expenses, as well as improved efficiency in support functions and customer
service operations.

**_Maintain Financial Discipline to Support Deleveraging_**

We intend to maintain a high focus on continuing to improve cash flows, supported by, among other things,
rapid EBITDA growth resulting from management’s and the Sponsors’ cost saving initiatives on top of
global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry. For our business, which benefits from significant
operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in capital
expenditures broadly in line with historical capital expenditures. We expect improved cash flows and
discipline in capital expenditures to provide a strong liquidity cushion for our ongoing business needs,
which was further bolstered by our A400 million Revolving Credit Facility and the long dated maturity
profile of our other principal sources of debt financing. In terms of risk management, we are partly
naturally hedged for transaction currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the

-----

same country as the end consumer, but we also intend to continue to implement exchange rate hedging
policies through natural hedge strategies and derivatives. As a result, we believe that the successful
execution of our strategies will allow us to progressively de lever and further improve cash flow generation.
Notwithstanding our intention to de lever and our focus on organic growth, we also intend to selectively
consider acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung,

distribution of pharmaceutical products in Switzerland, to expand our Swiss operations.

**_Appointment of a New Chief Financial Officer_**

On February 1, 2020, Dr. Wolfgang Ollig was appointed as our new Chief Financial Officer.

**_The Takeda Acquisition_**

On March 3, 2020, we closed our acquisition of the Takeda CIS Assets from Takeda in consideration for a
purchase price of $610.0 million (after giving effect to a purchase price reduction of $50.0 million for
working capital relating to the Takeda CIS Assets that is retained by Takeda), subject to a post-closing
adjustment. The Takeda Acquisition was financed with the proceeds from our offering of temporary notes,
which had been deposited into escrow on November 29, 2019, pending completion of the acquisition. Upon
completion of the Takeda Acquisition, the temporary notes were exchanged for an equivalent amount of
our Senior Secured Notes. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, a third-party due diligence report
estimated that the Takeda CIS Assets generated EBITDA of approximately A55.6 million. In addition,
based on such report, we expect that we will be able to implement a number of cost saving initiatives that
will create estimated run-rate synergies of approximately A7.6 million.

**_The Walmark Acquisition_**

On March 4, 2020, we borrowed A260.0 million under Facility E2 and completed our acquisition of the
entire share capital of the Walmark Group for an aggregate purchase price of approximately A140 million.
We intend to use the remaining proceeds of approximately A120 million for our general corporate
purposes. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2019, we estimated based on information provided to us
by the vendor that the Walmark Group generated EBITDA of approximately A6.5 million. In addition,
based on our estimates, we expect that we will be able to generate substantial cost savings and synergies as
a result of the Walmark Acquisition.

**_Senior Term Facilities Amendment and Repricing_**

On February 13, 2020, we completed a cashless refinancing and amendment of our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, which extended the termination date of all term loan facilities to August 2026
(subject to certain conditions) and reduced the interest rate on one of our term loan facilities.

**_2020 Tap Notes and GSK Portfolio Acquisition_**

Also on February 13, 2020, we closed an offering of additional Senior Secured Notes for aggregate net
proceeds of approximately A353 million, which we intended to use for our general corporate purposes,
including add-on acquisitions. On February 24, 2020, we agreed to acquire a portfolio of 15
well-established consumer healthcare brands from GlaxoSmithKline for a purchase price of between
A311 million and A321 million (the ‘‘GSK Acquisition’’). This brand portfolio includes branded products
from multiple therapeutic areas that are marketed across more than 40 countries, predominantly in
Europe. We expect the GSK Acquisition to close at the end of the second quarter of 2020.

**_Covid-19_**

In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus
continues to spread globally, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has
spread to over 100 countries. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive
across many aspects of society and has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, significant
disruptions to businesses and capital markets around the world.

Protecting the health and well-being of our staff is a key priority for us. To assist social distancing and help
mitigate the spread of the virus, our employees that are not directly involved in producing, testing, quality
release and dispatching medicines are all now working remotely. In addition, we are implementing several
measures to safeguard supplies of our products to patients and healthcare professionals, in particular
safeguarding supplies of essential treatments such as cancer therapies, transplantation drugs and
cardiovascular medicines, to ensure we can continue supporting healthcare systems. We are also working to
ensure, to the extent possible, we maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials so that we can
continue to meet demand for our generic and consumer healthcare medicines.

At present, we are generally not experiencing material adverse impacts to or significant delays in our
business operations in connection with Covid-19. Our dedicated staff are ensuring that manufacturing is
continuing at our facilities around the world. March 2020 saw our highest monthly production output in

8


-----

our 125-year history as we worked to meet the significantly increased global demand for critical medicines
and other products, in particular painkillers and products, such as certain vitamins, that contribute to the
normal functioning of the immune system, driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, with a view to
supporting our communities, we are prioritizing the production of medicines that are in high demand as a
result of the Covid-19 pandemic, such as anti-infectives, immunostimulants and painkillers, while
continuing to focus on supplying essential treatments such as cancer therapies.

**_Revolving Credit Facility_**

On March 31, 2020, we drew our Revolving Credit Facility in full in light of the severe disruption in
economic and social conditions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. We decided to draw down the
full amount out of an abundance of caution and to ensure that we can fund our future growth initiatives
when opportunities arise. We will continue to monitor our liquidity needs as the Covid-19 crisis develops.

**_Local financings_**

Upon closing of our acquisition of the Takeda CIS Assets in March 2020, the seller was required to charge
value-added tax of approximately RUB 5,200.0 million on top of the purchase price, which we expect the
competent Russian tax authority to refund within six to twelve months from the closing date. To finance the
tax payment, we have obtained an unsecured, ruble-denominated loan from a local bank, which also helps
us to mitigate our exposure to foreign exchange volatility.

On April 17, 2020, we entered into another unsecured, ruble-denominated loan facility. We intend to use
the proceeds for our groupwide general corporate purposes and this also creates a further natural hedge
against fluctuations in the euro-ruble exchange rate. See ‘‘Capitalization.’’

**_Recent Trading_**

Based on our unaudited management accounts, we estimate that our sales increased by A171.8 million, or
28%, from A607.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to A779.6 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020. We estimate that Management Adjusted EBITDA increased by
A77.2 million, or 64%, from A119.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to A197.1 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020. We estimate that our Management Adjusted EBITDA for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2020, was A676.7 million. We believe that these results have been driven
mainly by our cancer treatment Bortezomib, which we launched in April 2019, the impact of our recent
acquisitions and forward buying in response to Covid-19. As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash
equivalents of A1,095.8 million.

_The preliminary financial results as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and the twelve months_
_ended March 31, 2020, presented above have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors, nor_
_have any procedures been performed by our independent auditors with respect thereto. Such information has_
_been derived from management accounts, is preliminary and is subject to our financial closing procedures_
_which have not yet been completed. While we believe these preliminary results and estimates to be reasonable,_
_our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should_
_not place undue reliance on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in_
_the remainder of the financial year or any future period. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and_

2025. The gross proceeds from the offering of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the 2017 Senior Notes, together with cash
on hand, were used to refinance amounts that were incurred under the bridge facilities which the Issuers had obtained in
connection with the STADA Acquisition and to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the
Existing Notes. On February 13, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued A350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
additional 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024, a portion of the gross proceeds of which we intend to use to finance the GSK
Acquisition and the remainder for our general corporate purposes, including potentially additional add-on acquisitions. See
‘‘Summary—Recent Developments—2020 Tap Notes and GSK Portfolio Acquisition.’’ In addition, on November 29, 2019, we
issued A600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% temporary notes. On March 3, 2020, the proceeds of such
temporary notes were used to finance the Takeda Acquisition and, substantially concurrently with the completion of the Takeda

additional 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes due 2024. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments—The Takeda Acquisition.’’

(5) On December 4, 2018, the Senior Notes Issuer issued A250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7[1]⁄4% Senior Notes due
2025. The gross proceeds from the offering of the 2018 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) repay in full
the senior bridge facility that was used to finance part of the purchase price for the acquisition by German Holdco of additional
common shares in STADA pursuant to the delisting tender offer made by German Holdco for any and all outstanding STADA
Shares not directly held by German Holdco and (ii) to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of
the 2018 Senior Notes.

(6) In connection with the STADA Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement currently provides for committed facilities of A2,365.0 million and
£266.0 million in the form of (i) Facility E2 in an amount of A260.0 million; (ii) Facility F (EUR) in an amount of
A2,105.0 million; (iii) Facility F (GBP) in an amount of £266.0 million; and (iv) the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of
A400.0 million. All of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U. guarantee the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities on a senior basis, _pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and senior to the Senior Notes_
Guarantees. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations are, and
the Additional Notes will be, secured on a first-priority basis by (v) a pledge of the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a
security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Senior Notes
Issuer and a pledge of the material bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (w) a pledge of the shares in German
Holdco, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by German Holdco to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and a pledge of the material bank accounts of German Holdco; (x) a pledge of the STADA Shares acquired by the Senior

to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or German Holdco; (y) a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables
owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by any Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement); and (z) pledges of the shares in each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U. and the
material bank accounts (subject to certain exclusions based on the Agreed Security Principles) of each Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor. The existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities have been utilized by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, German
Holdco and certain restricted subsidiaries. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities
_Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ As of the date of this offering_
memorandum, each of Facility E2, Facility F (EUR), Facility F (GBP) and the Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in full. The
commitments made available under these facilities may be increased in the future.

(7) The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is offering A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will issue the Additional Notes as additional notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to
which the Existing Senior Secured Notes were issued. We expect that the Additional Notes will be issued with more than _de_
_minimis OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Additional Notes will not be fungible for U.S. federal_
income tax purposes with the Existing Senior Secured Notes and will be issued with separate common codes and International
Securities Identification Numbers (‘‘ISINs’’) than those assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes, but otherwise will have
the same terms and conditions as the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Listing
_and General Information.’’_

(8) On the New Issue Date, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The
Senior Secured Notes Collateral also secures the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis. A portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the Shared Collateral,
also secures the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. See ‘‘The Offering—Collateral.’’ The validity and enforceability of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the security and the liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and security
provider will be subject to certain limitations. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’ The security interests in favor of the Senior Secured_
Notes (including the Additional Notes) and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

(9) On August 25, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer incorporated German Holdco as its wholly owned subsidiary and
contributed all of the STADA Shares held by it as of such date to German Holdco and it also contributed any STADA Shares it
subsequently acquired to German Holdco. German Holdco also wholly owns Nidda Healthcare Beteiligungserwerbs und
verwaltungs GmbH, which is a holding, management and finance company with no material business operations, assets or
liabilities. German Holdco may increase its shareholding in STADA using all or a portion of the proceeds from the Offering.

(10) As of December 31, 2019, the book value of the aggregate principal amount of STADA Existing Debt was (i) A266.6 million of
non-current obligations under the 2022 Notes, (ii) A48.5 million of non-current obligations under various promissory notes
(Schuldscheindarlehen) and (iii) A40.1 million of bank loans. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

(11) For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accounted for 19.1% of the consolidated sales
and 44.2% of the consolidated EBITDA of the STADA Group. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Notes

11

Guarantors accounted for 51.8% of the consolidated assets of the STADA Group. The validity and enforceability of the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and the security interests and liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee are subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

(12) As of December 31, 2019, we had local credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount equal to A40.1 million. Our local credit
facilities consisted of (i) an unsecured loan facility in Serbia in a principal amount of RSD 4.3 billion (equal to A36.3 million)
and (ii) an unsecured loan facility in Argentina in a principal amount of ARS 257.1 million (equal to A3.8 million). In addition,
as of December 31, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and certain other transactions as described under
‘‘Capitalization,’’ certain of our subsidiaries in Russia would have had outstanding debt of RUB 22.2 billion (equal to
A258.3 million based on the March 31, 2020 exchange rate). See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Local Credit
_Lines’’ and ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments.’’_

_without your consent or the Trustees or the Security Agent obtaining_
_your further consent,’’ ‘‘Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,’’ and ‘‘Description of the_

acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions
of additional shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
subsidiaries and refinancing certain existing indebtedness and
(ii) to pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . Any payments made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor with respect to the Additional
Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes
unless required by law. If such withholding or deduction is
required by law in any ‘‘relevant taxing jurisdiction,’’ the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amounts received by the holders of the
Additional Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less
than the amount that they would have received in the absence of
the withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes.’’

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or part of the
Senior Secured Notes on or after September 30, 2020, at the
relevant redemption price set forth under ‘‘Description of the

-----

Prior to September 30, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes by paying a
‘‘make whole’’ premium as described under ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.’’_

Prior to September 30, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
may in each calendar year redeem up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any
additional Senior Secured Notes) at a redemption price equal to
103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

Additionally, at any time prior to September 30, 2020, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may on one or more occasions redeem
upon notice up to 40% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes using the net proceeds
from certain equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to
103.50% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided that at least
50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes remains outstanding after the redemption, with
the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

Optional Redemption for Tax
Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event of certain developments affecting taxation that
become effective after the New Issue Date, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole but
not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.’’_

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer experiences a change of
control event or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer ceases to
own 100% of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any successor
entity (excluding directors’ qualifying shares), the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will have the right to require the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to offer to repurchase the Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase.
However, a change of control pursuant to (i) above will not be
deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage
ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event or upon
signing of a definitive agreement in respect thereof. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control.’’

Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured
Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender
offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third-party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, purchases, all of the Senior Secured Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or such third-party will have the right to redeem
the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but
not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to each other holder of Senior Secured Notes. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits, among other things,
the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries to:

                - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue
certain preferred stock;

                - create or incur certain liens;

                - make certain restricted payments;

                - make certain investments;

                - impose restrictions on the ability of their subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer;

                - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

                - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants.’’_

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as
the Senior Secured Notes achieve investment grade ratings. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade_
_Status.’’_

Each of the covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is
subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.’’

U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations of an investment in the Additional Notes, see
‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations.’’ You should consult your own tax advisor to_
determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences of an investment in the Additional Notes.

17


-----

Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . The Additional Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal
income tax purposes because the stated principal amount of the
Additional Notes will exceed their issue price by an amount
equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount.
Therefore, in addition to the stated interest on the Additional
Notes, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation will be
required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary
income), on a constant yield to maturity basis, in advance of the
receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of such
holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. The Additional Notes will not be fungible with the
Existing Senior Secured Notes and will have separate ISINs and
common codes from the ISINs and common codes assigned to
the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Certain Tax
_Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’_

Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees
thereof have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act
or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and will not be so
registered. The Additional Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Holders of
the Additional Notes will not have the benefit of any exchange
or registration rights.

Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Investing in the Additional Notes involves substantial risks. You
should consider carefully all the information in this offering
memorandum and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific
risk factors set forth in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section before making
a decision whether to invest in the Additional Notes.

No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Additional Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although the Initial Purchasers of the
Additional Notes have advised us that they intend to make a
market in the Additional Notes, they are not obligated to do so
and they may discontinue market making at any time without
notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the Additional Notes.

Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of the
Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can
be no assurance that the Additional Notes will be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the
Additional Notes will be granted or that such listing will be
maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to
the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial
instruments, as amended.

Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Senior Secured Notes Indenture is, and the Additional
Notes will be, governed by the laws of the State of New York.
Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
governing law of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes may be amended with the consent of
holders of at least a majority (50%) in principal amount of such
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by the laws of England
and Wales. Each Security Document is governed by applicable
local laws.

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_The following tables present our summary financial information and have been derived from, and should be_
_read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are_
_included elsewhere herein and the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ ‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial_
_Information,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

_This offering memorandum includes certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,_
_2019, presented at the level of the Senior Notes Issuer, on an adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the_
_Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom and certain other transactions as described in_
_‘‘Capitalization,’’ including financial information as adjusted to reflect the effect of the Offering and such_
_transactions on the Senior Notes Issuer’s indebtedness as if the Offering and such transactions had occurred on_
_December 31, 2019, and on the Senior Notes Issuer’s interest expense as if the Offering and such transactions_
_had occurred on January 1, 2019. The pro forma financial information as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what the Senior_
_Notes Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Offering and certain other transactions_
_as described in ‘‘Capitalization’’ occurred on December 31, 2019 or January 1, 2019, respectively; nor does it_
_purport to project the Senior Notes Issuer’s financial results, indebtedness or interest expense at any future date._
_The pro forma financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, has not been prepared in_
_accordance with IFRS. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro_
_forma financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, have been audited or reviewed in_
_accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards._

_Results of operations for prior years or periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the_
_full year or any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and_
_ratios that we report herein, such as EBITDA (before leases), EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA,_
_Management Normalized EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in this offering_
_memorandum) and leverage and interest coverage ratios, are not financial measures defined in accordance with_
_IFRS, U.S. GAAP or the HGB and, as such, may be calculated by other companies using different_
_methodologies and having different results. Therefore, these performance indicators and ratios are not directly_
_comparable to similar figures and ratios reported by other companies._

(1) We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of operations
attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates
as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under
IFRS, but also on a constant-currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure, constant-currency sales. Constant-currency sales is
used to adjust for the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our
non-euro-denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this
measure facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of the Group’s operations. For a reconciliation
between the foreign exchange rates used for reporting purposes in our Financial Statements and the foreign exchange rates
used for purposes of the calculation of constant-currency sales, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP
_Financial Measures—Constant-currency Sales.’’_

(2) We define EBITDA (before leases) as earnings before interest (including interest expense on lease liabilities), taxes,
depreciation (including depreciation of lease assets in connection with leases), amortization, impairment losses and rent
expense. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. We define
Management Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items as set forth below. We define Management
Normalized EBITDA as Management Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted for certain normalization adjustments described below.
We define Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Management Normalized EBITDA, adjusted for certain one-off and run-rate
adjustments, expected cost savings and the impact of certain past and pending acquisitions as set forth below.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as
depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions
or regimes, we believe EBITDA-based measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of
the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we present Non-GAAP Measures such as EBITDA (before

23


-----

leases), EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested
parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. In addition, we present EBITDA (before leases) to facilitate a
comparison of our results of operations before the impact of different lease accounting standards and other rent expense. We
believe this presentation is useful to investors, as our results of operations are presented in accordance with IAS 17 for all
periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2018, whereas all periods thereafter are presented in accordance with IFRS 16. By
adding back depreciation of finance lease assets and right-of-use assets in connection with leases, interest expense on lease
liabilities and rent expense (which comprises, among others, the rent expense in accordance with the applicable lease
accounting standard), we eliminate all expenses resulting from lease accounting and other rent expense and enable investors to
compare our performance across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease accounting standard and other rent expense.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies
and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating
results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures
of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using
these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—
_Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’_

Set forth below is a reconciliation of each of EBITDA (before leases), EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA,
Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to earnings after taxes which we believe is their closest
comparable IFRS measure.

(A) Represents audited financial data for the periods presented.

(B) Our income statement information is presented in accordance with IAS 17 for all periods ended on or prior to
December 31, 2018, whereas it is presented in accordance with IFRS 16 for all periods thereafter. As a result, the
comparability of our EBITDA between these periods is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019,
resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets and a decrease in rent
expense. To facilitate a comparison of our results of operations across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease

accounting standard, we present EBITDA (before leases). By adding back to earnings after taxes: (i) income taxes;
(ii) financial income and expenses (excluding leasing); (iii) depreciation and amortization net of write-ups of non-current
assets (excluding leasing); and (iv) a lease adjustment comprised of (I) depreciation of finance lease assets, interest
expense on finance leases and rent expense (including operating lease expense and other rent expense not affected by
lease accounting), and, respectively (II) depreciation of right-of-use assets, interest expense on lease liabilities and rent
expense (including rent expense exempt from or not affected by lease accounting), we eliminate all expenses resulting
from lease accounting and other rent expense and enable investors to compare our performance across periods and
irrespective of the applicable lease accounting standard and rent expense on the basis of EBITDA (before leases).
EBITDA (before leases) is then adjusted to include rent expense to arrive at EBITDA.

(C) Relates to measurement effects due to purchase price allocations and significant product acquisitions, using the year
ended December 31, 2013 as the baseline. With respect to the Senior Notes Issuer, the effects from purchase price
allocations and product acquisitions relate to measurement effects due to the purchase price allocation for the STADA
Acquisition.

(D) Relates to fees paid for financial advisory, legal and other professional fees in connection with the STADA Acquisition
and the Takeover Offer.

(E) Relates to miscellaneous extraordinary income and expenses.

(F) Management Normalized EBITDA represents Management Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain normalization
adjustments. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Management Normalized EBITDA, adjusted for (i) certain
one-off, run-rate and cost savings adjustments and (ii) the estimated impact of the Takeda Acquisition, the Walmark
Acquisition, the GSK Acquisition, the Fern C acquisition and the Opti Pharm acquisition. These adjustments are set
forth in more detail below.

In connection with the STADA Acquisition, we commissioned third-party due diligence reports to analyze STADA’s
financial condition and operations and the potential for achieving cost savings at STADA. We have derived certain
normalization, one-off, pro forma and cost savings adjustments from one of these reports, which we updated in
connection with the Offering. Our normalization adjustments normalize certain income and expense items; our one-off
adjustments adjust our results for certain events that could be considered one-off in nature; our run-rate adjustments
adjust our results for the pro forma impact of certain acquisitions and disposals that we carried out after January 1, 2019;
and our cost savings adjustments give pro forma effect to certain expected cost savings.

In addition, we commissioned third-party due diligence reports to analyze the financial condition and operations of the
Takeda CIS Assets and the Walmark Group and the potential for achieving cost savings and synergies following the
completion of the relevant acquisition. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted to give effect to (i) the
estimated run-rate impact of the Takeda Acquisition, based on unaudited carve-out financial information of the Takeda
CIS Assets for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, contained in such report, and (ii) the estimated run-rate impact
of cost savings initiatives that we intend to implement or have implemented following the completion of the Takeda
Acquisition. Furthermore, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted for the estimated run-rate impact of the
Walmark Acquisition, based on unaudited carve-out financial information of the Walmark Group for the twelve months
ended May 31, 2019, contained in such report (excluding expected synergies).

The calculation of Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on various
assumptions and estimates by external consultants and management. This information is inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
those assumed in the adjustments below. As a result, while we believe that these adjustments and potential cost savings
are reasonable estimates, the actual results and cost savings in any given period may differ from those estimated herein.
See also ‘‘Forward-looking Statements.’’

The presentation of Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is for informational purposes
only. Neither Management Normalized EBITDA nor Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represent the results we would have
achieved had each of the events or items for which an adjustment is made occurred on or prior to January 1, 2019.
Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are included in this offering memorandum
because we believe that each of these metrics provides a useful measure of our results of operations after giving effect to
the initiatives described below; however, these numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by
any independent accounting firm, and this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under
IFRS. You should not consider Management Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to
net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as measures of our results of
operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate similarly titled financial
measures differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies. See also ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information.’’

(a) This adjustment represents certain consulting expenses, mainly including (i) consulting expenses related to a
realignment of our marketing and distribution strategy in the amount of A10.5 million; (ii) consulting expenses
related to the Sponsors’ Transformation Program in the amount of A14.2 million (including IT and supply chain
management transformation); (iii) consulting expenses related to outsourcing projects in the amount of A6.9 million;
(iv) consulting expenses related to a new management reporting structure in the amount of A2.6 million; and (v) the
Sponsors’ monitoring fees in the amount of A3.6 million.

(b) Represents certain legal, advisory, other professional fees and travel costs directly incurred in connection with
certain past and pending M&A transactions.

(c) Following completion of the STADA Acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring expenses related to
(i) severance payments, headhunter costs and costs for leadership onboarding in connection with a restructuring of
our senior management; and (ii) a bonus payment of A1.0 million to our executive management.

(d) Represents the sum of (i) the costs we incurred in connection with the deconsolidation of our vaping businesses in
the Netherlands and Germany and (ii) the negative EBITDA contribution of these businesses until the date of
deconsolidation.

(e) Following the insolvency of the Russian reseller Rosta, we wrote off our uncollectable receivables in the second half
of 2017 but added 50% of the associated impairment charges back to EBITDA. In 2019, we recovered A2.8 million
from Rosta’s credit insurer and hence management subtracted 50% of such income from our Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA.

(f) Mainly relates to (i) prior period charges pertaining to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, but paid in the
year ended December 31, 2019, of A5.4 million, (ii) non-operating loss of A1.0 million in relation to the sale of
STADA Vietnam which was deconsolidated in December 2017 and disposed of in December 2019, (iii) costs
incurred in connection with the review of our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 of A0.7 million, and (iv) other non-operating expenses of A2.1 million.

(g) Represents an adjustment in respect of foreign exchange losses (net of gains) incurred in connection with the
borrowings and losses on hedging contracts in relation to the purchase price for the Takeda Acquisition.

(h) Represents an adjustment in respect of the remaining 50% of the reimbursement for uncollectable Rosta
receivables.

(i) Represents a run-rate adjustment giving effect to our acquisition of a GSK’s Violet product portfolio in July 2019 as
if such acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019.

-----

(j) Represents a run-rate adjustment giving effect to our acquisition of Biopharma in December 2019 as if such
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019.

(k) Represents a run-rate adjustment giving effect to the annual royalty income our subsidiary, Bioceuticals, expects to
receive from Pfizer. Pfizer distributes one of the products developed by Bioceuticals in the United States. While
sales were ramping up in 2019 (especially in the U.S. market where sales started in May 2019), we believe they have
reached a sustainable level. As a result, we have included a run-rate adjustment of A9.2 million to annualize the
expected average annual royalty income.

(l) Represents cost savings that we expect to realize from past and ongoing initiatives undertaken in connection with
our Transformation Program, including (i) approximately A45.7 million of cost savings that we expect to realize in
the year ending December 31, 2020 and (ii) approximately A3.0 million of cost savings in IT, the majority of which
we expect to realize within the next 18 months. Excludes additional expected cost savings from further initiatives
that we intend to implement after December 31, 2020. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements.’’

(m) Represents the estimated EBITDA impact of the Takeda Acquisition, which completed in March 2020, as if such
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019, and giving effect to expected synergies of A7.6 million.

(n) Represents the estimated EBITDA impact of the Walmark Acquisition, which completed in March 2020, as if such
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019, and not including expected synergies.

(o) Represents the estimated EBITDA impact of the GSK Acquisition, which was agreed in February 2020, as if such
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019 (excluding synergies).

(p) Represents the estimated EBITDA impact of the Fern C Acquisition, which closed in March 2020, as if such
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019 (excluding synergies).

(q) Represents the estimated EBITDA impact of the Opti Pharm Acquisition, which closed in March 2020, as if such
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019 (excluding synergies).

(3) Represents audited financial data for the periods presented.

(4) EBITDA margin represents, in any period, EBITDA for such period, divided by sales for such period.

attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates
as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this offering memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under
IFRS, but also on a constant-currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure, constant-currency sales. Constant-currency sales is
used to adjust for the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our
non-euro-denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this
measure facilitates an understanding of the underlying economic performance of the Group’s operations. For a reconciliation

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Additional_
_Notes should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this offering_
_memorandum before making a decision to invest in the Additional Notes. Any of the following risks,_
_individually or together, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and_
_prospects, and accordingly the value of the Additional Notes. This section describes the risks and uncertainties_
_that we believe are material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones that we face. Additional_
_risks and uncertainties, including those of which we are currently unaware or those which we deem immaterial,_
_may also result in decreased sales, assets and cash inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or_
_other events that could result in a decline in the value of the Additional Notes, or which could have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. The order in which the_
_risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their_
_potential impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or on the trading price_
_of the Additional Notes._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

The risks that might have a material impact on the Group’s business operations include the following:

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may adversely affect our sales, margins and operations._**

Our industry is highly competitive and is driven by a variety of factors, including price, reliability of quality,
local market expertise, distribution channels, portfolio breadth, marketing, packaging and brand loyalty.
Our two divisions, Generics and Branded Products, face intense competition from our competitors’
products.

Many of our competitors are well known pharmaceutical companies with substantial financial and other
resources. Companies with more resources may have a greater ability to conduct the development work
necessary to obtain marketing authorizations. Our products could, for example, be rendered obsolete or
uneconomical through the development of new products or technological advances in manufacturing or
production by our competitors. Our competitors’ products may also be, or be perceived as being, more
effective or more efficiently marketed and sold than our products. Our competitors may also be able to
sustain a deliberate substantial reduction in the price of their products or services for longer periods. This
is likely to result in significant price pressure in an increasingly commoditized market, which, in turn, may
reduce our sales and market share. In addition, competition in certain of our markets is particularly intense
due to the use of public tenders. Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical products have been
implemented (by both public and private entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate,
such as Germany, in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private entities
do not directly set the prices of pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products);
rather, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and
governments or private entities select a winning bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing
practices and the reimbursement of drugs. See ‘‘—Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender
_systems could lead to delivery bottlenecks or an unintentional increase in inventories.’’_

The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by continuous product development and technological
change. The entry of new players and products in any of our markets may make it difficult for us to
increase our market share, retain existing competitive positions or access new markets at all. If we fail to
maintain our competitive position, through either product development or effective marketing, or if any of
our larger competitors engage in pricing competition with us, there could be a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
Additional Notes.

**_We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these regulations, or the failure by us or any of_**
**_our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm our business._**

We are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulations. These regulations govern, among
other things, the development, authorization, manufacturing and procurement of contract manufacturing,
wholesale distribution and supply, pharmacovigilance and promotion of our products. See ‘‘Regulation.’’
While the regulations in the European Union are to a certain extent streamlined, the regulatory
environment outside the European Union is fragmented and varies by country. Globally, we market our
products in approximately 120 countries, mainly across Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States

29


-----

(‘‘CIS’’) region, the MENA region, Asia, Australia and South America, and each of these countries may
regulate these areas differently.

In our Generics division, we sell unbranded generic products mostly comprising prescription products. In
most countries, the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly (for example, through
statutory price reductions) or indirectly (for example, through reference prices and reimbursement rates
payable by the health insurance system, mandatory discounts, terms and/or requirements concerning
discounts, the creation of framework conditions to stimulate market forces and competition). Pricing also
may be influenced by supranational regulations in the European Union. Any changes in these regulations
or procedural rules, such as those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the
profitability of individual products and, in exceptional cases, could render the market introduction of a new
product unprofitable.

The regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate rigorously monitor and enforce compliance
with the relevant regulations by pharmaceutical companies, and our operations are subject to periodic
inspections by the relevant regulatory authorities in our markets. As a manufacturer of pharmaceutical
products, we are, for example, subject to principles of good manufacturing practice (‘‘GMP’’) and good
distribution practice (‘‘GDP’’), and compliance with these principles is assessed by the competent
regulators via site audits. See ‘‘Regulation—European Union—European Union Pharmaceutical Regulatory
_Regime—Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing’’ and ‘‘Business—Procurement, Production and Quality_
_Management—Highest Quality and Safety Standards.’’ Following these inspections, the relevant regulator_
may issue notices listing the conditions that inspectors believe may violate GMP, GDP or other applicable
regulations, and warning letters that could modify certain activities identified during the inspection. Failure
to comply with the applicable regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, the
recall or seizure of products, the total or partial suspension of production or distribution, the suspension of
the review of our product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution, as well
as reputational harm, reduced sales and market share. Moreover, the production of biologics and
biosimilar products is subject to particularly complex regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations
may lead to production failures, recalls or fines. In addition, we could incur substantial remediation costs.
If any of these risks materialize, our sales could be materially and adversely affected.

While we believe that we are taking adequate measures to mitigate the regulatory risk, there can be no
assurance that, should regulatory scrutiny further increase, they will continue to be effective. In addition,
continuing compliance with increased regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase our costs. We also have
affiliations, in licensing agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory
approvals of their processes and products. These third parties are subject to similar regulatory compliance.
If any of those third parties does not comply with our regulatory requirements, we could be adversely
affected if their non-compliance results in an interruption in our supply of raw materials or ingredients or,
in the case of any of our licensors, it hinders our ability to produce our in-licensed products.

Any failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers or licensors to comply with governmental regulations,
or any regulatory action taken against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_We are exposed to changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory factors that are_**
**_beyond our control._**

Our results of operations have been, and continue to be, affected by conditions in the global economy. For
example, international conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the political situation in
certain countries in which we operate, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, and the impact of the
ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, may adversely affect the macroeconomic environment. See
‘‘—We operate manufacturing facilities and sales entities and have significant sales in Russia, which has
_experienced conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be the subject_
_of national and international sanctions,’’ ‘‘—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European_
_Union may have a negative effect on our business’’ and ‘‘—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases,_
_including the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto may materially affect our business_
_and results of operations.’’ These events have influenced, and may continue to influence, the development_
of our sales in the relevant markets. While sales in our Generics division, which mostly comprises
nondiscretionary prescription products, are less vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, our results of
operations in the Branded Products division, which mostly comprises self-pay OTC products, is more
sensitive. An economic downturn and lower household incomes can significantly depress demand in the

30


-----

self-payment market, i.e., the market for pharmaceutical products for which consumers are not reimbursed
as part of their personal national health insurance plan.

We believe that we are particularly exposed to a deterioration in the Russian economy. Russia accounted
for A263.9 million, or 10%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, Russia’s recent
economic deterioration had, and any future downturn (including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic)
may have, a particularly negative impact on our sales. In addition, the United Kingdom accounted for
A250.0 million, or 10%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019, 88% of which was in Branded
Products. As a result, we believe we are also exposed to any deterioration in the UK economy, and there
can be no assurance that Brexit (as defined below) or other factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, may
not result in a decline in the economic condition of the United Kingdom. Moreover, one of our largest
markets in the Generics division, Spain, which accounted for A113.5 million, or 7%, of our generic sales in
the year ended December 31, 2019, is still experiencing a period of political and economic uncertainty.
Since the beginning of 2019, the situation in Catalonia calmed down in connection with the proclamation
of independence by the Catalan regional parliament. The court rulings of the Spanish Supreme Court
against prominent Catalan politicians in October 2019 have again escalated the tensions in the conflict. It
remains to be seen to what extent the Spanish government will succeed in reducing the uncertainty in the
region resulting from the pro-independence movement and thus the uncertainty about the possible
outcome of political and social tensions in Catalonia. The escalation of the conflict related to the
independence of Catalonia from Spain led to boycott campaigns against products and suppliers that are
headquartered in Catalonia, including STADA, and there can be no assurance that new boycott campaigns
will not be carried out again, either in Catalonia or in the rest of Spain.

Our Generics division is also exposed to fluctuations in the economy to the extent economic, political and
regulatory factors induce cost containment reform measures in any country, which could affect
reimbursement rates and our sales of prescription drugs. For example, the sustained economic downturn in
Spain has resulted in a number of cost containment measures in recent years. See ‘‘—Existing and future
_healthcare cost containment reform measures by government health authorities or government-sponsored_
_healthcare systems could adversely affect our business’’ below._

Any of these factors, or others that we cannot anticipate, may adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under
the Additional Notes.

**_Existing and future healthcare cost containment reform measures by government health authorities or government-_**
**_sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business._**

In various countries where we operate, government health authorities provide healthcare at a low direct
cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for
the government-sponsored healthcare system. The continuing increase in healthcare expenditure has
therefore been the subject of considerable government attention in many of the countries in which we
operate, particularly as public resources have been stretched by the global economic crisis. Furthermore, in
recent years, the increasing average age of the population and the associated increasing demand for
pharmaceutical products has led to rising healthcare costs.

Increasing expenditure on healthcare has been the subject of considerable public attention. In recent years,
many countries across the globe have discussed or implemented a measure of healthcare reform. The
primary focus of these reforms was to introduce cost containment measures and optimize governmental
healthcare spending, particularly for prescription drugs, which account for a major part of our sales.
Measures implemented in line with these reforms are fragmented and vary by country. The Russian
government, for example, has released a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (‘‘VEP’’) that are
subject to mandatory price caps. Overpricing can result in fines and other penalties. Certain European
countries have introduced numerous austerity measures to lower healthcare spending, including
mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules. In certain cases, reimbursements for high
priced drugs were refused. The United Kingdom and Germany introduced new systems to determine the
cost-effectiveness of drugs, which will decide the reimbursement level for a drug. In Spain the
government’s pricing and reimbursement policy is focused on cost containment measures as they attempt
to reduce their financial deficit, which has repeatedly resulted in price cuts, reductions to wholesale and
retail margins and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs since 2000; we believe the pace at which these
regulatory measures are enacted has accelerated in recent years. The Spanish government has also enacted
four royal decree laws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical industry by means of price

31


-----

reductions for older pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs and medical devices, and
limitations on the number of products eligible for a reimbursement under the Spanish National Health
Service. Certain countries also cut their healthcare expenditure budgets or fixed them at a particular
amount. Furthermore, mandatory price cuts were introduced in respect of both generic and patented
drugs. As of the date of this offering memorandum, many countries are in the process of implementing
further healthcare cost containment measures in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. For
example, under a draft law published in Germany on April 21, 2020, the Ministry of Health would be
entitled to intervene in order to ensure a continuous supply of certain categories of medicines to the entire
population. Moreover, according to a regulation published in Germany on the same day, pharmaceutical
companies which sell specifically pandemic-related medicines are required to to set their prices close to
their cost of production, and surcharges related to the pandemic are explicitly prohibited. See also
‘‘Regulation.’’

While most of our Branded Products are non-reimbursable OTC drugs, which are generally less affected
by the above measures, those measures may affect our Generics division, which mostly comprises
prescription products, in a number of ways. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive
for any Generics product we currently distribute or will develop in the future. As a result, we may be
disincentivized from developing and marketing new products or from entering new markets. Existing
regulations that affect the prices of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before our
products are approved for marketing. Our products may not be considered cost-effective or adequate
third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an
adequate return on our investment. The governments of the countries where we operate may, in the future,
implement further regulations that impose additional pressure on the price of pharmaceutical products,
including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Any of the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Obtaining and maintaining necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products is time_**
**_consuming, and may not in each instance prove successful._**

We must obtain a marketing authorization and other regulatory certifications, licenses and approvals prior
to marketing or manufacturing new pharmaceutical products, which applies to both Generics and Branded
Products. See ‘‘Regulation’’ and ‘‘—We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these
_regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm_
_our business.’’ Although less onerous than for originator pharmaceutical companies, the process of_
obtaining marketing authorizations and other regulatory certifications, licenses and approvals to
manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming and costly. Depending on
the country and therapeutic area, the issuance of an approval may take two years, or even longer. As the
authorization process is time consuming, we may be unable to realize the momentum for the launch of new
products, which may result in the loss of sales and market share. To the extent that we are unable to secure
timely approvals for new products, we will depend on our existing products to maintain our sales. There
can be no assurance that these products will continue to remain competitive and generate sufficient sales
over time.

There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval of any application we submit for the
commercial sale of a product in time, or at all. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain or
maintain regulatory approval in respect of our products could adversely affect our operating results by
restricting or delaying the introduction of new products. If health or safety concerns arise with respect to a
product, we may be forced to withdraw it from the market and could face legal action if any harm came
from the use of such product. For example, in September 2019, the German Federal Institute for Drugs
and Medical Devices (‘‘BfArM’’) and the European Medicines Agency (‘‘EMA’’) informed us that there
has been a recall in the European Union of medicinal products containing the active pharmaceutical
ingredient (‘‘API’’) ranitidine, produced by the API manufacturer Saraca Laboratories (India). The reason
for the recall is indications of possible nitrosamines impurities, which are considered carcinogenic, in
ranitidine produced by Saraca Laboratories (India). In the Balkan countries, we use a dossier with the
ranitidine API produced by Saraca Laboratories (India). Although as of the date of this offering
memorandum we have not received any instructions from the local authorities in the Balkan countries to
recall our products containing this API, we understand that the Serbian authorities are currently in contact
with the German authorities and therefore there is a risk that the Serbian authorities will follow the
BfArM and also order a recall of products containing ranitidine. Furthermore, our products must be

32


-----

successfully registered in the markets in which they are commercialized. For example, in the Generics
division, a significant factor in the development and approval of each product is the strict observance of
commercial property rights, such as patents and supplementary protection certificates.

Moreover, if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a drug, it may be limited with respect to the
indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for
the drug. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our pharmaceutical products could
result in restrictions on the use of a drug, including possible withdrawals of the drug from the market. Any
delays in obtaining governmental approval or authorization of new or existing products may have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_If we are unable to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new Generics products in a timely manner, it_**
**_could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to perform our obligations_**
**_under the Additional Notes._**

We are focused on generics and therefore only conduct limited proprietary research on new drugs. As a
result, we do not typically incur material research expenses. As a generics company, however, we incur
development costs in connection with marketing authorizations and the production of our new products, as
well as other activities that facilitate their commercialization. As a result, future results of operations
depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new
products in a timely manner. The development, manufacturing and commercialization process is time
consuming. We must develop, test and manufacture our products as well as successfully register them in
each relevant jurisdiction. All our products must meet and continue to comply with regulatory and safety
standards in each of the markets in which they are to be commercialized. There can be no assurance that
the necessary marketing authorizations will be obtained in a timely manner or at all and delays or the
inability to obtain regulatory approval could adversely affect our business. See ‘‘—Obtaining and
_maintaining necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products is time consuming,_
_and may not in each instance prove successful.’’_

Our products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as
expected or may face greater than expected competition. In addition, our new products may be unable to
achieve their planned value. The successful development and manufacture of new products also depends
on our ability to secure, on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, the required raw
materials. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new products will be accepted by the medical
community in our target markets. See ‘‘—Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part,
_upon the acceptance of the products not only by end-users, but also by independent third parties, including_
_public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists, depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate.’’ Finally, we_
are dependent on partnerships and joint ventures with third parties and we face the risk that some of these
third parties may fail to perform their obligations under the relevant contracts, thus reducing our ability to
successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new products in a timely manner. See ‘‘—We are
_exposed to default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of contracting_
_parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations.’’_

Should any of the above risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional
Notes.

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims._**

From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters, including product liability claims, warranty
obligations claims, alleged violations of trade confidentiality and others. See ‘‘Business—Legal
_Proceedings,’’ ‘‘—Our reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to product_
_liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived’’ and ‘‘—Third parties may claim that we infringe_
_their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products.’’_
When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in an
amount equal to our estimated liability. However, there can be no assurance that our provisions will be
sufficient to cover our actual litigation costs. In addition, third-party litigation, including litigation related
to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law, patent law and the implementation of individual regulatory
requirements in the provision of healthcare at a national or supranational level, could have an indirect,
materially adverse impact on us and the market environment in which we operate.

33


-----

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved in 12 pending general litigation cases.
Although we currently only consider one of these disputes related to our operations in Serbia as material,
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation
claims or similar matters under various laws or that product specific provisions will be sufficient to cover
litigation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing
litigation under the laws of certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any
materially adverse effects on our business in such country. For example, one of our subsidiaries in Russia
was recently held liable by a Russian court for damages of approximately A26 million in connection with its
purchase of a product portfolio. The Russian subsidiary has filed an appeal against this decision within the
statutory deadlines.

Any of these events could result in considerable costs, including damages and legal fees, and a temporary
or permanent ban on the marketing of certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from_**
**_manufacturing and selling our products._**

There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry with respect to the manufacture, use
and sale of generic pharmaceutical products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of
patents or the proprietary rights of third parties. Originator and generic pharmaceutical companies are
increasingly patenting not only the relevant molecules or manufacturing processes relating to a final
dosage product, but also the formulations and production processes of active pharmaceutical ingredients.

While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon the commercial property
rights of other parties, we believe that patent infringement claims are typical of our industry. While we
generally take great care in ensuring that the new products we launch do not violate any intellectual
property rights of third parties and seek to refrain from selling products prior to the expiration of their
patent protection, there can be no assurance that an intellectual property infringement claim could not be
brought against us and that we would not be found to infringe on the commercial property rights of others.
This is also due to the fact that, in certain countries, such as Italy, patent applications are not publicly
disclosed until the patent is issued and, therefore, we may not be aware of currently filed patents. In
addition, even if our searches in the registers indicate that patents or other intellectual property rights have
expired, there can be no assurance that originators or other parties that previously held such rights will not
subsequently seek to restore their patents. If any application to restore intellectual property rights were
granted after we had started marketing a product, we could be found to violate such rights and become
liable for damages to their owners. We may also be subject to other legal action preventing or impeding
our future marketing of the subject product.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are involved in 7 pending patent infringement lawsuits.
We believe that the claims alleged in these pending patent infringement lawsuits have no merit and that we
will not be required to make any material compensation payment.

We may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, selling
or using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
infringement. Furthermore, a significant third-party claim could result in management’s attention being
distracted from current operations.

The outcome of intellectual property related proceedings could adversely affect, hinder, delay or prevent
the manufacture, use, marketing or sale of our products or processes. We may also be required to pay
substantial damages or change our product offerings or expend significant resources to develop
non-infringing products or processes. Any of the above could affect our ability to compete or have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes.

We rely, in part, on license, collaboration and other agreements to develop our product portfolio. For
example, we occasionally enter into research and development partnerships with universities. The
underlying collaboration agreements may provide that we are granted the exclusive license to
commercialize the final product. Our present and future licenses, collaborations and other intellectual
property related agreements may impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone,
royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us.
If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized

34


-----

manner, we may be required to pay damages and our licensors may have the right to terminate the license.
If our license or other intellectual property related agreements are terminated, we may be required to
cease developing and commercializing drug candidates that are covered by the licensed intellectual
property.

In addition, our licensing, collaboration and other agreements under which we license intellectual property
or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible
to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise
could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or
technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant
agreement. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our
ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be
unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected drug candidates. For example, such disputes
may relate to: (i) the scope of rights granted under the agreement and other interpretation related issues;
(ii) the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is
not subject to the agreement; (iii) the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative
development relationships; (iv) our diligence obligations under the agreement and which activities satisfy
those diligence obligations; (v) the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from
the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our collaborators; (vi) the
priority of invention of patented technology; and (vii) in the case of joint developments, the ownership of
intellectual property rights.

To help protect any proprietary know-how we develop and any inventions for which patents may be
unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we may have to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements. There can be no assurance that all our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors who
have access to our trade secrets and confidential information will agree to enter into agreements that
prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and
assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Even
where such persons entered into such agreements, these agreements may not provide adequate protection
for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or
disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how
or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other
proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.

If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or maintain the
existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon the development of the relevant
program or drug candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s net assets, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Industrial action or adverse labor relations could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our operating_**
**_results._**

Our operations depend on employees who are parties to collective bargaining arrangements, works council
agreements and/or benefits from local applicable law, defined benefit plans, regulations or customs
regarding employee rights and benefits. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory employee relations,
ensure the safety of our employees during the Covid-19 pandemic or negotiate acceptable labor
agreements in the future, results could include work stoppages, strikes or other industrial action or labor
difficulties (including higher labor costs) at any or all of our global facilities.

While we believe that we have good relations with unions and our employees generally, there can be no
assurance that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the
future. Any of these adverse labor situations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Our reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to product liability or contamination_**
**_issues, whether actual or perceived._**

Although generic companies, such as us, are engaged in the reproduction of pharmaceutical products and
their active pharmaceutical ingredients that are vetted by regulations and often have been in the market
for ten or more years, there is a risk that our Group may be liable to, or incur costs related to, liability
claims if any of such companies’ products cause injury or are found to be unsuitable during their
development, manufacture, sale or use. These risk exists even with respect to products that have received,

35


-----

or may receive in the future, regulatory approval for commercial use. Moreover, our products could
contain contaminated substances that we have not identified during our manufacturing process, and
adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. We could also be
subject to product liability claims as a result of defective raw materials we purchase from third parties.

Product liability lawsuits could be costly to defend, and could result in reduced sales, substantial monetary
awards to clinical trial participants or customers, harm to our brand and reputation, the inability to
commercialize products that we develop and diversion of management’s time, attention and resources.
Considerable sums in damages have been awarded in certain countries against pharmaceutical companies
due to physical harm allegedly caused by the use of certain products. Product liability claims may force us
to withdraw some of our products from the market, thus creating the potential for further claims.
Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims would likely result in negative publicity, decreased
demand for any products that we may develop, injury to our reputation and the suspension or withdrawal
of clinical trials, and require us to incur significant legal fees. We currently have insurance coverage for
product liability claims. See ‘‘Business—Insurance.’’ However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover
all or even a material part of a significant product liability claim. Furthermore, at any time, insurance
coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Our failure to successfully defend a product liability lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
Additional Notes.

**_Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by_**
**_end-users, but also by independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists,_**
**_depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate._**

Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of products by
independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors, pharmacists, wholesalers, distributors,
hospitals, group purchasing organizations, government representatives and other retailers, as well as
end-users. In our Branded Products division, we rely, to a significant extent, on the strength of our brands
and reputation and our acceptance by third-party agents and distributors. Examples of our strongest
brands include APO-go, Covonia, Ladival, Aqualor, Grippostad, Snup and Vitaprost. Unanticipated side
effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products or brands, or the brands of our in-licensed
products, could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians,
managed care providers, pharmacies and other retailers, customers and patients.

In addition to the strength of our brand and reputation, acceptance of any of our products among the
medical community depends upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. With respect
to Generics and prescription items in our Branded Products division these factors include the following:

- acceptance by payors, physicians, pharmacists and end-customers of each product as an effective
treatment;

- whether a physician is receptive to our product and how quickly the physician adopts it as an accepted
treatment;

- the product’s price;

- the product’s perceived advantages and disadvantages relative to competing products or treatments;

- the prevalence and severity of side effects; and

- adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies.

If our products have received a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities but do not achieve
an adequate level of acceptance by independent third parties, we may be unable to generate sufficient or
any sales from these products to make them profitable. If our products fail to maintain significant market
acceptance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_If our suppliers or we encounter problems manufacturing products or cease to manufacture products, our business_**
**_could suffer._**

We strive to deliver high quality pharmaceutical products to our customers. The manufacture of our
products is highly exacting and complex due, in part, to strict regulatory requirements governing their

36


-----

manufacture. We rely on complex machinery and information technology systems to support our
manufacturing processes, as well as internal and external communications with respect to supplies, quality
control and distribution. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including
equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials
and environmental factors. If problems are severe, we may be forced to temporarily suspend all or part of
our production until the problems are rectified. The actions taken by several countries in response to the
Covid-19 pandemic, including severe restrictions of movements, may prevent our employees, contractors
and suppliers from conducting business activities, which may disrupt manufacturing at our facilities around
the world as well as our supply chains and, in turn, may adversely impact our ability to source raw materials
in time, or at all, and to meet the demand for our generic and consumer healthcare medicines. Any of the
foregoing are likely to result in increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to perform
existing contracts, time spent investigating the cause, remedial costs and, depending on the cause, similar
losses with respect to other batches or products. In addition, where problems are not discovered before the
product is released to the market, we may be forced to recall products from the market. For example,
complying with a directive by the competent European authorities, we recalled all affected batches
containing the Valsartan active ingredient that were supplied by our Chinese supplier in July 2018. We also
proceeded with a second recall in September 2018, due to the contamination of a few batches at the
production facilities of Hemofarm AD. In certain cases, we may face product liability claims and incur
respective costs. See ‘‘—Our reputation among end-users and other market participants may suffer due to
_product liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived.’’ The facilities used to manufacture our_
products are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the relevant
principles of GMP. See ‘‘—We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these
_regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm_
_our business.’’ While we manufacture most of our products, others are manufactured by our contract_
manufacturing partners. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are
manufactured in accordance with the principles of GMP and believe that we diligently monitor our
suppliers’ compliance within the applicable requirements, we do not control the day-to-day activities of,
and we are dependent on, the contract manufacturing partners for their compliance with GMP
requirements. If we or any of our suppliers were to violate the applicable principles of GMP, we or such
supplier could be fined, and the competent regulator could impose a complete shutdown of such supplier’s
noncompliant manufacturing plant. As a result, we could become subject to a supply shortage with respect
to the products we source from the sanctioned supplier. If our inventories of these products turn out to be
insufficient, this could adversely affect our sales. For example, in June 2018, our Serbian subsidiary
Hemofarm AD received notice of an impurity detected in one of the active ingredients (Valsartan) used in
our production. This active ingredient was supplied by one of our Chinese suppliers who has now been
sanctioned, and therefore we are facing a shortage in the supply of Valsartan. As a result, we may be in
breach of our own delivery contracts and may be liable for damages to our customers. In particular, our
German discount agreements provide for contractual penalties in the event we fail to perform our
obligations in full or at the time contemplated by the agreement. Although we may have recourse against
our suppliers, our recovery may be subject to contractual or equitable limitations as well as the solvency of
our suppliers and be insufficient to offset the damages payable to our customers. If our manufacturing
partners or we cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our specifications and the strict
requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities, our manufacturing contractors and we will not be able
to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our respective manufacturing facilities. If a regulatory
authority does not approve a facility for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such
approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities. Although we carry out
compliance checks, the occurrence or suspected occurrence of production not in line with our
specifications or regulatory requirements can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls
and enforcement action, with consequential damage to our reputation and the risk of product liability. The
investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause manufacturing delays, substantial
expense, lost sales and the delay of new product launches.

Any of the risks described above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Our business could be adversely affected if we incur significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt-on_**
**_acquisitions, if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or if we are unable to enforce claims relating to a_**
**_breach of the representations and warranties provided in connection with such acquisitions._**

In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and acquisitions, and we intend
to continue this combination in the future. Examples of our acquisitions in 2018 include the acquisition of
the rights to the anti-dandruff shampoo Nizoral in Europe and the MENA region, the purchase of
trademark rights to Hedrin in Belgium, Spain and Portugal, the product rights for APO-go in Germany
and Scandinavia, the acquisition of the majority stake in Bioceuticals, a German manufacturer of the active
ingredient and finished product erythropoietin, being marketed to both third-party customers and STADA
sales companies, the repurchase of all European trademark rights to Ladival, and the acquisition of
Ketodol. Examples of acquisitions in 2019 include the acquisition from GlaxoSmithKline, through our
British subsidiary Thornton & Ross, of five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe as
well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and the acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical
prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. We believe that none of these acquisitions
materially affected the comparability of our results of operations. In addition, in March 2020, we
completed the Takeda Acquisition through which we acquired the Takeda CIS Assets, a portfolio of
selected products sold, inter alia, in Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan and
the Walmark Acquisition, through which we acquired a leading manufacturer of consumer in Eastern
Europe headquartered in the Czech Republic. Acquisitions are part of our strategy, and we intend to
selectively explore strategic acquisitions in the global generics and OTC markets, with a focus on target
companies and/or pharmaceutical assets that allow us to leverage our existing platform and realize
meaningful synergies.

Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected
benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. While we conduct due
diligence in preparation for each acquisition, it is possible that legal, tax and operational risks of the
respective target, some of which may be unknown or undisclosed to us at the time of the acquisition, such
as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
may materialize, have more severe consequences than expected or increase the costs for the integration of
a target. For example, the Walmark vendor has informed us that one of Walmark’s competitors in Bulgaria
has filed a claim with the Bulgarian antitrust authorities against Walmark’s Bulgarian subsidiary, alleging
unfair practices by Walmark. The Bulgarian authorities have dismissed the claim but the claimant has
appealed. This may potentially result in Walmark’s Bulgarian subsidiary facing a fine of up to
approximately A0.8 million and subsequent actions for damages by the injured parties. In addition, we
could become liable for overdue payables of a target or acquired company to suppliers or employees that
are not currently known to us or we could become subject to historic tax or pension liabilities of which we
are not currently aware of and we may underestimate historic or future tax or pension liabilities in relation
to target or acquired companies. In conducting our due diligence for the acquisition of a target, we may be
required to rely on external resources, including public information, information provided by the relevant
vendor and information from third-party consultants and advisers. For example, in connection with the
Takeda Acquisition and the Walmark Acquisition we were required to rely on information provided by the
Takeda and Walmark vendors. There can be no assurance that the due diligence we undertook in
connection with these or other acquisitions has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or
helpful in evaluating these or other acquisitions. Any such unknown or previously underestimated
liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Additional Notes.

In addition, acquisitions are also subject to the risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the payment
of consideration greater than the target market value. Also, we may be unable to evaluate the scale of a
potential acquisition, which may result in being unable to allocate proper resources to execute the
acquisition and subsequent integration efficiently.

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent, among other things, on the successful integration of
the products and businesses we acquire at the expected costs, and their subsequent expansion into new
markets or into the existing markets in which we operate. Such integration and expansion require
substantial time and focus from management and may put a strain on our management resources,
distracting our managers from their regular tasks and require additional management resources to be
deployed, especially where a large-scale acquisition is involved, which could adversely affect their ability to
operate our business. Although we believe that our current managerial, administrative, technical and
financial resources are capable of supporting our recent and proposed future expansion, there can be no

38


-----

assurance that our existing resources will be sufficient for this purpose, or that we will be able to acquire
the necessary additional resources on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may be
unable to deploy sufficient resources to integrate a large-scale acquisition, including the acquisitions of the
Takeda CIS Assets, Walmark and the assets to be acquired from GlaxoSmithKline, which may result in us
being unable to realize desired synergies, operational efficiencies and cost savings. We may not be able to
realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the
costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such
operational efficiency and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors, including
increases in expenses related to such acquisitions. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, may
offset the expected cost savings from the acquisitions. There is also a risk that key employees of companies
we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully commercialize products and technologies that we
acquire, may seek employment elsewhere, including with our competitors. Any failure to acquire, maintain
and deploy adequate management, sales, administrative, technical and financial resources to support our
expansion could undermine our acquisition strategy.

In addition, our acquisitions of target companies or product portfolios may be subject to regulatory
approval. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for our future
acquisitions without unreasonable expenses and within a reasonable time period or at all.

Our failure to integrate acquired businesses and products, or to realize the intended synergies, may
prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes.

In addition, we may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and
warranties provided in connection with the acquisition of a target and our ability to recover losses suffered
as a result of such a breach may be limited. In connection with the acquisitions of the Takeda CIS Assets
and Walmark, the respective vendors have given certain customary representations and warranties and
indemnities. Nonetheless, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities Takeda
and the Walmark vendors have agreed to retain, and we may not be able to enforce any claims against
Takeda or the Walmark vendors relating to breaches of these representations and warranties. The liability
of Takeda and the Walmark vendors under these agreements is very limited. Moreover, even if we are able
to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these representations and warranties, we may
temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, if either Takeda or the Walmark
vendors become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of
Takeda’s or the Walmark vendors’ breach may be limited by the liquidity of Takeda or the Walmark
vendors or the applicable laws governing applicable bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such breach of
applicable representations and warranties, we could incur losses which could in turn adversely impact our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Our operations may be disrupted by accidents, equipment malfunctions or other unexpected events._**

Although we believe that we have adopted and maintain adequate safety precautions, if one or more of our
production facilities were to suffer a serious accident, breakdown, equipment malfunction or other
unexpected event, part of our production capacity could be jeopardized and our sales and net income
would be materially adversely affected until we repair or find a replacement for any such facility or
machinery. Any of these events could also result in a decrease of the market shares we currently hold in the
relevant markets in which we operate or with respect to the products we manufacture. While we believe
that our production facilities maintain sufficient insurance to cover any such property and other asset
damages, depending on the risk and type of asset or property insured, any losses related to a serious
accident, equipment malfunction or other unexpected event could exceed the amount of this coverage, and
subsidiaries whose business solely consists of the management of intellectual property rights and the
receipt of royalties do not normally carry business interruption insurance at all. In addition, the
refurbishment or reconstruction of any of our production facilities or the construction of new facilities
could be subject to regulatory approval by the competent health authorities of the jurisdictions in which
they are located as well as the health authorities of some or all of the jurisdictions to which products from
such facilities are exported, which could result in significant delays in the resumption of product
manufacturing. If any of the above were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
Additional Notes.

39


-----

**_Accidental contamination, noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws or environmental, health and_**
**_safety litigation or liability, could adversely impact our business and operating results._**

Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals and include
hazardous or toxic materials. These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination,
events of noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal
injury, property damage, and claims and litigation resulting from such events. If an accident occurs, or if
contamination is discovered, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages or fines, which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes. We are currently not aware of any material contamination
incidents or material noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws.

The environmental laws of many jurisdictions in which we operate may impose potential obligations to
clean up contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites that we acquire, own or operate, which
we formerly owned or operated, or for which we may otherwise have retained liability or where waste from
our operations was disposed. Were such environmental cleanup obligations to arise they could significantly
reduce our operating results. In particular, any financial accruals that we may make for these obligations
might be insufficient if the assumptions underlying the accruals proved to be incorrect, or if we are held
responsible for additional contamination.

Stricter environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs
and liabilities for us, and could result in handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or
pollutants being subjected to more rigorous scrutiny by relevant regulatory authorities than is currently the
case. Compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures, as well as other costs,
thereby potentially harming our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform
our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Failure to renew agreements with our material suppliers and wholesale customers on acceptable terms or the_**
**_termination of such agreements by material suppliers or wholesalers could harm our business._**

Although we have a large number of suppliers and customers and believe that our business is not
materially dependent on any single one of them, failure to renew contracts with material suppliers, such as
suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients, equipment (including, for example, medical devices) or
other items and material customers, such as hospitals, pharmacies and drugstores could negatively impact
our business. In addition, some of our major supply and wholesale contracts are subject to change of
control provisions that may grant the respective counterparties the right to terminate the relevant contracts
as a result of a change of control, which in certain but not all contracts may shorten the termination or
contract period originally contemplated under the contract. At the end of a contract’s term, which may be
accelerated as a result of a change of control termination, these suppliers or wholesalers have a choice to
either renegotiate their contract with us, increase or decrease its scope (with our consent), seek out our
competitors to provide the same or similar services or cease outsourcing the relevant activity. Whenever a
contract expiries or is due for renewal, suppliers and wholesalers may seek a price adjustment from us. In
addition, these parties may seek a price adjustment when their business experiences significant volume
changes. Furthermore, certain suppliers or wholesalers may seek to increase prices previously agreed with
us due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the supplier or
the wholesaler. If our contracts are terminated either by a material supplier or wholesaler (for example, as
a result of a change of control event being triggered) or not extended upon their termination, if our
material suppliers or wholesalers shift business away from us, or if we are unsuccessful in retaining high
renewal rates and contract terms that are favorable to us, this can cause delays and may have a material
adverse effect on our business and our respective operating divisions, financial condition, results of
operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems could lead to delivery bottlenecks or an_**
**_unintentional increase in inventories._**

Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical products have been implemented (by both public and private
entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate, such as Germany, in an effort to achieve
lower prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private entities do not directly set the prices of
pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products) but manufacturers submit bids that
establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and governments or private entities select a winning
bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing practices and the reimbursement for drugs.

40


-----

Initially, the tender system in Germany resulted in intense price-based competition, which pushed the
pricing of generic products to a marginal-cost level. Although competition subsequently decreased and
margins have partially recovered, as many smaller competitors proved unreliable in terms of their ability to
fulfill large orders, there can be no assurance that new entrants will not intensify the level of competition
again. Moreover, tender systems implemented by governmental institutions or public health insurance
organizations could determine fluctuations in national markets, leading to changes in large volumes in the
demand for pharmaceutical products. These fluctuations have a direct consequence on our business. Even
if we undertake great efforts to avoid delivery bottlenecks or an unintentional increase in inventories by
way of scenario calculations and specific operational positioning of the respective supply chain, these
events cannot generally be ruled out due to our extensive portfolio. Any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Any significant increases in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our products_**
**_or their availability could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results._**

Affordable, high quality active ingredients or auxiliary materials are essential to our business due to the
nature of the products we manufacture. Active ingredients and auxiliary materials are generally available
from multiple suppliers and often sourced locally. We acquire these ingredients and auxiliary materials
directly from the suppliers or enter into contracts with manufacturers producing the pharmaceutical
products. Increased prices, rationing or shortages as well as fluctuations in prices can occur. In some cases,
we manage these risks through mechanisms aimed at reducing our financial exposure, such as price
escalation clauses (which link procurement prices to current selling prices) and specific procurement prices
for specific sales volumes. However, there can be no assurance that rapid cost increases or extended supply
shortages will not occur and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and ability to
perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_We are subject to risks associated with cross-border sales and purchases._**

We market our products in approximately 120 countries globally, with a direct presence in about 30
countries from which we carry out our local and export sales. Due to differing regulatory regimes, certain
of our products may be classified as Generics in some countries and as Branded Products in others.
Different classifications could also result in pricing differences, which may be material. Cross-border
operations are subject to risks, including but not limited to:

- the inadequate protection of intellectual property;

- difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign
laws, regulations and treaties, some of which are subject to change;

- legal uncertainties regarding, and timing delays associated with, customs procedures, tariffs, import or
export licensing requirements and other trade barriers;

- differing local product preferences and product requirements;

- increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts;

- the risk of loss at sea or other delays in the delivery of products caused by transportation problems;

- differing tax regimes; and

- economic sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods (see ‘‘—Our international
_sales and operations increase the risks associated with economic and trade sanctions imposed by the_
_European Union and other jurisdictions’’)._

Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our operating results.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in many different countries._**

We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of generic and branded pharmaceutical products that
are available in approximately 120 countries, including the MENA region, Germany, Italy, Belgium,
Russia, Spain, Serbia, France, Switzerland, Vietnam and the United States. Both our operations and those
of our local sales and business partners in these countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in
the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; expropriation or other
governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflicts; bribery and

41


-----

corruption; national and regional labor strikes; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; the
deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting the production, pricing and marketing of
products; anti-trust risks; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation
of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of
global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions, market opportunities and operating
restrictions; and changes in financial policy and the availability of credit.

We have identified potential misconduct in our Russian operations. The alleged activity includes
overpayment for advertisement and supplies, improper distribution of gift cards to pharmacies and conflict
of interest of a few local top managers in certain procurement and distribution arrangements as well as the
registration of intellectual property rights in the name of third parties when it was possible to register such
rights on behalf of our Russian subsidiary. We conducted an internal investigation into these matters and
retained external advisers. As a consequence of our findings, certain employees were dismissed and a new
management team was installed, and relevant processes and controls were redesigned to address the
compliance violations identified. We identified approximately A24.5 million of funds that were potentially
misdirected over a period of time in these schemes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
recover our losses, if any, and there may be tax consequences related to un-reclaimable VAT and
potentially challenges due to deductions of costs in previous tax returns resulting from payments associated
with these activities.

We also from time to time receive whistleblower complaints from our employees and third parties. These
complaints are often vague and ambiguous and have in the past occasionally proven to be false. In
addition, some allegations are unspecific without any concrete information or evidence. As a result,
whistleblower complaints oftentimes require substantial preliminary assessments of credibility before they
can be progressed and investigated to mitigate the risk of liability for false allegations. Although we
thoroughly evaluate whistleblower complaints as a matter of urgency, there is a risk that the alleged
wrongdoing continues until we have completed our initial assessment, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, we or any of our local business partners may be subject to legal proceedings regarding bribery
and corruption in these countries, and we are unable to ensure or monitor the lawful conduct of our
business partners’ operations, though we try to mitigate this risk by having anti-bribery provisions in our
contractual arrangements and structural measures such as compliance trainings and audits to verify
adherence to our compliance standards. These factors could adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_The pricing of cross-border transactions is often the subject of negotiation with tax authorities, and any adjustments_**
**_imposed may lead to the greater or double taxation of profits._**

Most national tax authorities follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or
United Nations guidelines when considering the arm’s-length nature of cross-border pricing of goods and
services. Adjustments made by a national tax authority may not lead to a corresponding adjustment in the
other tax jurisdiction. Also, even where a corresponding tax adjustment is allowed, national tax rates may
be different and may therefore increase our overall burden of taxation. Our cross-border trade is
increasing and, although we benchmark our intercompany pricing regularly, the risk of an adverse
adjustment will require constant monitoring, which may require a substantial amount of management
resources. Potential discrepancies in the adjustments made by the tax authorities in certain jurisdictions
may result in an increased tax burden on our Group.

**_We operate manufacturing facilities and sales entities and have significant sales in Russia, which has experienced_**
**_conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be the subject of national and_**
**_international sanctions._**

We operate two manufacturing facilities and several sales entities in Russia, which together employed
2,164 full-time equivalents as of December 31, 2019, of which 636 full-time equivalents were employed in
production. Russia accounted for A263.9 million, or 10%, of our sales in 2019. Russia has experienced
conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries, including Ukraine. As a result of these conflicts, Russia
has become subject to national and international sanctions (including sanctions by the European Union
and Ukraine, which are the most relevant to STADA’s business) some of which impose restrictions on
imports from Russia. These sanctions, coupled with low commodity prices, the devaluation of the Russian
ruble against other major currencies and high inflation, contributed to the decrease in our financial

42


-----

performance in Russia since 2014, which affected both our sales and earnings. Some of these sanctions
have been extended in light of the continuing turmoil in Ukraine. While certain countries exempt
pharmaceutical products, such as ours, from the scope of their sanctions, no such exemption applies under
the Ukrainian sanctions regime. Historically, because we served the Ukrainian market through supplies
from our presence in Russia, these sanctions prevented us from making any sales into Ukraine which
adversely affected our sales and profitability. While our acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical
prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine in 2019 has provided us with domestic capabilities to
serve the Ukrainian market, our ability to fully serve such market remains limited by the aforementioned
geopolitical factors. Furthermore, the Ukrainian sanctions regime prohibits both our Ukrainian operations
and their financing banks from making payments into Russia. In addition, there is a risk that these
countries may further expand the scope of their sanctions against Russia and that other countries will
impose similar sanctions in the future. See ‘‘—We are subject to risks associated with cross-border sales and
_purchases.’’_

Moreover, our manufacturing facilities in Russia could be disrupted by the conflict with Ukraine or by
other wars, political unrest, terrorist activity or economic upheaval. Any such disruption could cause losses
in efficiencies, delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance
proceeds may not adequately compensate us for our losses. Furthermore, our operations in Russia may be
subject to risks arising from a less stable legal and regulatory framework and less-transparent enforcement
of the law. This could result in, _inter alia, increased difficulty in enforcing contracts, collecting trade_
receivables, the imposition of additional regulations, an increase in taxes or restrictions of the import of
products. Any of these factors could potentially damage our reputation or affect our sales and the
operation of our manufacturing facilities, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Our international sales and operations increase the risks associated with economic and trade sanctions imposed by_**
**_the European Union and other jurisdictions._**

Economic sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods have in the past been imposed
on companies engaging in certain types of transactions with specified countries in which we do business,
including but not limited to Russia, Lebanon, Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar, Libya and Iran. Although
pharmaceutical products are generally excluded from the scope of sanctions, our exports and transfers
could be impacted by such sanctions, which would limit our ability to trade with sanctioned individuals
and/or sanctioned countries and create practical complications for our exports, especially in terms of our
interaction with banks and receiving payments from sanctioned countries. For example, the competent
authorities could require banks to withhold payments due to us from sanctioned customers or countries.
The European Union and other countries have also enacted sanctions that prohibit transactions by their
citizens and domiciled entities involving certain specially designated individuals and entities from
sanctioned countries or participating in sanctioned activities including but not limited to terrorism and
drug trafficking. In addition, the European Union, the United States and certain other countries have
recently implemented measures against Russia in connection with the continuing turmoil in Ukraine. See
‘‘—We operate manufacturing facilities and sales entities and have significant sales in Russia, which has
_experienced conflicts with certain of its neighboring countries and has been and may in the future be the subject_
_of national and international sanctions.’’_

The terms of legislation and other rules and regulations that establish sanctions regimes are often broad in
scope and difficult to interpret. Neither our affiliates nor we are currently the target of any such sanctions
and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable sanction regulations.
However, these regulations and their enforcement could potentially affect our sales in the affected
countries and force us to change or abandon our growth plans. In addition, failure to comply with such
regulations could result in significant fines.

Although we currently do not have a direct presence in the United States and are mainly affected by
sanctions implemented by the European Union, we may not exclude the possibility that sanctions enacted
by the United States could affect us in the future. Any of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions could
result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform
our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our_**
**_business._**

The United Kingdom’s initiation of the process to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union following the national referendum in June 2016 (‘‘Brexit’’),
has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom, one of our
current markets, the European Union and its remaining member states, and may constitute an additional
risk for the financial markets and the European economy. Although the withdrawal agreement came into
effect on January 31, 2020, and provided for a transitional phase until December 31, 2020, the future
relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU following such transitional phase is subject to
ongoing negotiation and it is not yet possible to predict under what conditions such withdrawal will take
place or whether it will be a regulated or unregulated withdrawal. Brexit could, among other outcomes,
significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union, cause political and
economic instability in other countries of the European Union, including in our main markets (such as
Germany, Italy and Spain), contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets,
including volatility in the value of the euro and an increase in cost pressure in the European healthcare
system resulting, for example, in price reductions for our products. Brexit might also affect our ability to
maintain the current level of sales in the United Kingdom, accounting for A250.0 million, or 10%, of our
sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. Moreover, Brexit could affect our supply chain by causing
potential delays in the supply of our products across the new European border or in the storage of stock of
our products in the United Kingdom before their redistribution in the European Union. Given the lack of
comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the Brexit will have and
whether, and to what extent, our business could be affected. In addition, the Scottish regional government
is actively considering a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom which
may lead to additional uncertainty and may affect our business activities in Scotland and other parts of the
United Kingdom. These and similar events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response_**
**_thereto may materially affect our business and results of operations._**

Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of any contagious disease,
including the recent outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (Covid-19)
first announced in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Following the outbreak of Covid-19
in other countries, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Covid-19 constituted a
pandemic. In February 2020, Covid-19 was reported in northern Italy and has thereafter spread across
Europe as well as to several other countries around the world. Covid-19 has resulted in severe restrictions
on movement being imposed or considered in various countries, including countries where we manufacture
and sell our products, such as Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. As a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic, including national and supranational responses thereto, we and our employees,
contractors, suppliers, and other business partners risk being prevented, fully or partly, from conducting
business activities for an unknown period of time. Restrictions on travel, the imposition of quarantines,
shelter in place orders, business shutdowns and other measures imposed in response to the Covid-19
pandemic could disrupt our supply-chains, reduce availability of raw material such as active pharmaceutical
ingredients or personnel at our manufacturing sites and could adversely impact our ability to source and
transport raw material including active ingredients, bulk products and finished products, as well as
materials commonly used in the manufacturing process in the global healthcare industry. Suppliers may be
unable to manufacture and supply ingredients needed for our products on a timely basis due to restrictions
to, and disruptions in, their supply chains or labor forces or declarations of force majeure on their own part
or on part of their sub-suppliers. Any of the aforementioned restrictions may impact the performance of
our third-party contractors, may have a material adverse effect on the timely completion of our preclinical
studies and clinical trials, which may become significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate,
and may cause delays in regulatory submissions and grants of any regulatory approvals, any of which may
cause us to incur additional costs. The aforementioned restrictions have had and are likely to continue to
have, and any future restrictions imposed in connection with the potential health, social and economic
impacts of Covid-19, are likely to have, a negative effect on overall macroeconomic conditions and
financial markets, including supply chain shortages and additional business disruptions in the regions in
which we operate and the end-markets in which we sell our products, and may lead to substantial declines
in the purchasing power of broad portion of our customers who may no longer purchase our
self-medication products in the same quantities as they purchased in prior periods. In addition, we believe

44


-----

that our recent trading performance since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic was partly driven by
forward buying effects as wholesalers, pharmacies and consumers were stocking up on Covid-19 related
pharmaceuticals. As a result, there can be no assurance that our recent trading performance is sustainable
and will not be adversely impacted in future periods as our customers and consumers may delay further
purchases until they have used up existing inventories.

The Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the
capital markets and may adversely impact our ability to access cash. Any or all the aforementioned
consequences, individually or in the aggregate, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of
operations. Although as of the date of this offering memorandum, the Covid-19 pandemic has not had a
material adverse impact on our results and liquidity, the extent of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on
our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and
spread of the pandemic and related restrictions and the impact of Covid-19 on the overall economy, all of
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. There can be no assurance that the Covid-19
pandemic or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious diseases will not have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_Our sales and profits from generic pharmaceutical products may decline as a result of competition, both from other_**
**_pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental pricing pressure._**

Our generic products face intense competition. Prices of generics typically decline, especially as additional
generic pharmaceutical companies (including low-cost generic producers based in China and Vietnam)
receive approvals and enter the market for a given product and competition intensifies. Consequently, our
ability to sustain our sales and profitability on any given product over time is affected by the number of
new companies selling such product and the timing of their approvals.

In addition, intense pressure from government healthcare authorities, particularly in highly regulated
European markets, to reduce their expenditures on prescription drugs has resulted in lower
pharmaceutical pricing, causing decreases in sales and profits.

Furthermore, brand pharmaceutical companies continue to defend their products vigorously. For example,
brand companies often sell or license their own generic versions of their products, either directly or
through other generic pharmaceutical companies (so-called ‘‘authorized generics’’). No significant
regulatory approvals are required for authorized generics, and brand companies do not face any other
significant barriers to enter into such market. Brand pharmaceutical companies may also seek to delay
introductions of generic equivalents by a variety of commercial and regulatory tactics (such as obtaining
and enforcing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire, questioning the
quality and bioequivalence of generic pharmaceutical products, developing controlled-release or other
slightly modified versions, which often reduce demand for the generic version of the existing product for
which we are seeking approval, changing product claims and product labeling, developing and marketing
OTC versions of brand products that are about to face generic competition or trying to extend the duration
of their patents). These actions may increase the costs and risks of our efforts to introduce generic
products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether.

**_Our products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory_**
**_approval or limit their commercial potential._**

Although we disclose all known material side effects of our Generics and Branded Products in leaflets
included in each product packaging, undesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could
cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt development, could result in the denial of
regulatory approval of our product, lead to potential product liability claims and could damage our brand
reputation.

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining the commercial success of our product
candidates, could substantially increase commercialization costs and, in general, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and reputation._**

Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal
counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the

45


-----

Internet. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can potentially be life-threatening.
To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic
version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could
materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product, and harm the business of companies,
including ours, or lead to litigation. In addition, it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe
counterfeit products could mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. While we are not aware of
any material cases in the past, if one of our products were to be the subject of counterfeits in the future, we
could incur substantial reputational and financial harm.

**_We commercialize some of our products under license from third-party pharmaceutical companies._**

As of December 31, 2019, we commercialized certain of our products under license from a variety of
pharmaceutical companies. Our license agreements for in-licensed products typically provide that the
licensor shall manufacture such products for an initial term of several years and impose payment and other
material obligations on us. Although we believe that we currently comply with all our material obligations
under these licenses, should we breach any such obligations, our counterparties may be entitled to
terminate the licenses. This may restrict, delay or eliminate our ability to continue commercializing these
in-licensed products, which could adversely affect our business.

Our failure to in-license new products or compounds for development and distribution, replace existing
products as needed or to retain our currently in-licensed products on a commercially reasonable basis, or
at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_We may be unable to recruit and retain key personnel, including qualified scientific, technical and sales employees._**

We are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees, including our scientific, technical
and sales personnel. The loss of any senior manager or key employee may significantly delay or prevent the
achievement of our product development or business objectives. Due to the specialized scientific nature of
our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific,
technical and sales personnel. The loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key management, scientific,
technical or sales personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and financial condition. We
face competition for scientific and technical personnel from other companies, academic institutions,
government entities and other organizations. Such competition is also enhanced by the reduction of
specialized personnel in certain key functional areas, such as engineers in Germany. In addition, increasing
demand for higher wages may make it difficult for us to retain the necessary personnel.

The loss of any key personnel or the inability to attract, recruit and retain highly skilled employees
required for our activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_A breakdown in our information technology systems could result in a significant disruption of our business._**

Our operations, including research, development, manufacturing, accounting, storage and delivery, are
highly dependent on our information technology systems. We make continuous investments to
appropriately adapt these complex and high-performing systems to changing business processes. Such
systems are vulnerable to a number of problems, such as software or hardware malfunctions, malicious
hacking, physical damage to vital data centers and computer virus infection. In addition, the information
technology system needs regular upgrading to accommodate expansion of our business and maintain the
efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in our system, we could experience significant business
and operational delays across our businesses. In particular, any breakdown in our information technology
systems could result in disruptions in our research, development, manufacturing, accounting and billing
processes. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our
data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the
development of our product candidates could be delayed. Any of this could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
Additional Notes.

**_We handle personal data including, to a minor extent, sensitive patient data in the ordinary course of our business,_**
**_and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that data could result in legal liability for us and reputational_**
**_harm to our business._**

We process sensitive personal consumer data (including, in certain instances, consumer names, addresses,
and to a minor extent, patient health data) as part of our business, and therefore we must comply with
strict data protection and privacy laws in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we are
subject to extensive European laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection,
the main and most relevant of which relate to the collection, protection and use of personal and business
data, including EU Regulation 2016/679 (the ‘‘General Data Protection Regulation’’ or ‘‘GDPR’’). In
particular, we adapted our internal procedures to the requirements imposed by the recently implemented
GDPR. The costs of complying with the GDPR are increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that
adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. Any failure to comply with data
protection laws such as the GDPR may result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental
investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation. However, given the
size of our operations, data breaches may occur a result of human error or events beyond our control, such
as external hackings, malware infections, malicious user activities, internal security breaches and physical
security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access to our premises. For example, in
September 2019, we filed a report with the relevant German authority concerning a potential data breach
according to the GDPR. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not received a response to
this report and we cannot predict when an answer will be given. Additionally, it is not possible to predict
the amount of the fine that the relevant German authority may impose in the event it ultimately finds that
there was a violation. Although German supervisor authorities have not yet imposed fines over
A30.0 million (which is in general possible under the GDPR for very serious violations), we cannot predict
if the German authorities will find there was a data breach violation and, if so, the amount of the fines they
will impose.

Moreover, data protection laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our
ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, and could
make us liable in the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party
access. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cybersecurity breaches as a result of human
error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches
and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access.

We and our customers and suppliers who carry out our outsourcing, have been in the past and could be in
the future subject to breaches of security by hackers. A future breach of our system or that of one of our
customers or outsourcing partners may subject us to material losses or liability, including fines, claims for
unauthorized use of personal and sensitive data or other claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity
breach could harm our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or
failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits,
result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or
regulations, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We have policies and procedures in place to seek to prevent such breaches and carry out detailed root
cause analysis on any breach that does occur in order to ensure that similar occurrences do not arise.
However, if a single material breach or series of less material breaches was to occur, we could face liability
under data protection laws, could lose the goodwill of our clients and could have our reputation damaged,
all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_We are exposed to default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of_**
**_contracting parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations._**

We are exposed to default and counterparty risks in connection with deliveries of our products and services
to customers or as a result of financing or hedging activities if contracting parties fail to meet their
obligations. In addition, there is the risk that, in a difficult economic and financial environment, national
healthcare systems may delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners, thus generating or
increasing default or counterparty risks. Furthermore, default and counterparty risks from social health
insurance providers (‘‘SHIs’’) have increased due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. For example, in
Germany, rebate agreements with SHIs require pharmaceutical companies to ensure uninterrupted
delivery capability. In the event that we are unable to complete relevant deliveries, including for causes

47


-----

that might be related to Covid-19, we would be subject to contractual penalties and/or compensation
claims. Although we could claim that contractual performance has been rendered impossible for factors
and events attributable to Covid-19 and potentially invoke force majeure clauses, where available, we
would need to prove that any such factors and events fall within the scope of such clauses and that our
specific inability to perform deliveries is directly attributable to the applicable factors and events, any of
which may be difficult or impossible to prove, particularly in light of the complexity of the pharmaceutical
industry supply chains. In addition, according to a new German regulation published on April 22, 2020,
pharmaceutical companies are required to reasonably ensure an adequate and continuous availability of
certain critical medicines in order to ensure sufficient supplies to meet demand for the entire population.
Accordingly, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from fulfilling purchase agreements if the order
volumes are intended for individual stock-piling and would lead to general shortages. However, in such
instances pharmaceutical companies would be entitled to claim the relevant compensation from the
government. While we strive to maintain business relations with business partners of good financial
standing and adopt suitable measures to safeguard us against default risk, including guarantees, letters of
credit, credit insurance or the transfer of assets, it cannot be ruled out that these measures may be
insufficient. In addition, in certain developing markets, we rely on third-party distributors and other agents
for the marketing and distribution of products, who may have inadequate internal compliance resources.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_The recent development of vaping products means the long-term health effects of vaping product use is not yet_**
**_understood by medical professionals._**

Our Branded Products portfolio features non-generic pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products,
including vaping products, such as electronic cigarettes and vaporizers, which represented 0.8% of our
sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. These battery-powered products enable users to inhale
nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide and are marketed as alternatives to traditional
tobacco cigarettes and cigars. Although vaping products do not currently account for a material portion of
our sales, with respect to such products, we are exposed to long-term health related risks. Because vaping
products were recently developed, the medical profession has not had a sufficient period of time in which
to study the long-term health effects of vaping product use. As a result, it is unclear how safe vaping
products are for their intended use, or whether they may pose risks different from those posed by
traditional cigarettes and cigars. For instance, recently some U.S. states initiated a sales ban on
e-cigarettes. If the medical profession were to determine conclusively that vaping product usage poses
long-term health risks, vaping product usage could decline and we could be exposed to the risk of
litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
ability to perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

We market our products in approximately 120 countries, have a direct presence in Europe, the MENA
region, Asia, South America and Australia, and operate 21 manufacturing facilities in twelve countries.
Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are in currencies other than
the euro, our reporting currency, and as such our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and
transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British
pound sterling and Serbian dinar.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our
and their respective functional currencies. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but
generate sales in another, any change in the values of those currencies could cause our profits to decrease
or our products to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and
receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are greater or
less than our liabilities denominated in a different currency, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations
and movements in the foreign exchange markets. Where we are unable to match sales and receivables
denominated in foreign currencies with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our
results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results of
operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies into our euro reporting
currency. For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency

48


-----

items as of December 31, 2019 showed that in financial year 2019, an appreciation or devaluation of the
functional currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA
of approximately A2.0 million. At the same time, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency
in relation to the British pound sterling of 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of
approximately A24.9 million. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Additional
Notes.

We generally employ different financial derivatives to counter the risks associated with assets, liabilities
and anticipated future cash flows denominated in foreign currency. However, to the extent that such
financial instruments are not sufficient or not effective or due to a default risk of the relevant counterparty,
fluctuations of local currencies could affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to
perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_We may be exposed to transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities._**

We take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we
transfer and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a corporate
tax-transfer frame model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in
individual countries will assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax-transfer pricing model
and address retroactive tax claims against one of our companies. While our tax-transfer pricing model has
been agreed between the competent authorities in certain countries, in others such model is still under
discussion with the authorities. For example, transfer pricing agreements are currently under discussion
between the German and the Italian tax authorities. There can be no assurance that our transfer prices will
be accepted by all the relevant authorities. If they fail to be accepted, this could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
Additional Notes.

**_Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets may adversely affect our results of operations._**

Subject to certain conditions, we capitalize development expenses incurred in connection with the approval
process necessary to obtain marketing authorizations for our products and recognize such expenses as
intangible assets. In addition, as a consequence of our acquisition strategy, we regularly recognize
significant amounts of goodwill on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, we had intangible assets of
A4,794.9 million of which A559.6 million related to goodwill.

Goodwill is not amortized over its useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once a year
(the impairment-only approach) and additional reviews may be carried out if indications of impairment
become apparent. In the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is compared
with its recoverable amount and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.
All intangible assets other than goodwill are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets with a finite useful
life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. If, on the reporting date, there are
indications that these intangible assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is reevaluated
and impairment losses are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. We recognize
the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount as impairment loss in the income
statement. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist for these assets, corresponding
write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and in all other cases showing indications
of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and, if
necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell is
determined using the relief from royalty method. We recognized intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life in connection with our acquisition of the STADA Group for the brands STADA and Hemofarm. If the
reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the acquisition cost. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally
evaluated in the context of annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is
carried out to verify whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

The amount of impairment losses that we are required to recognize in the future may be significant,
particularly in the event of material acquisitions or products that perform below our expectations. See
‘‘—Our business could be adversely affected if we incur significant integration costs with respect to any of our
_bolt-on acquisitions, if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or if we are unable to enforce claims_
_relating to a breach of the representations and warranties provided in connection with such acquisitions’’ and_
‘‘—Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not
_only by end-users, but also by independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and_
_pharmacists, depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate.’’_

49


-----

The future development of the macroeconomic environment, unsuccessful acquisitions or other factors
could lead to possible significant impairments to be recognized in the future, potentially with a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_Our business is subject to other operating risks, including natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, terrorism and_**
**_other criminal activities which may adversely affect our financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to risks normally incidental to manufacturing operations that may result in
work stoppages and/or damage to property. These risks include unexpected disruptions in infrastructure,
strikes, accidents, natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, criminal activities and terrorism. While we
protect ourselves against such risks to the extent possible and financially reasonable through appropriate
insurance policies, it cannot be excluded that this protection will not be sufficient and that any of these
events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to
perform our obligations under the Additional Notes.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect_**
**_our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax positions, including our effective tax rate or tax
payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We
cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If
our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require
us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and
collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Pending and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax_**
**_liabilities._**

The Group’s business activity is assessed for tax purposes based on currently applicable tax legislation
taking into account current case law and administrative interpretations. There may be uncertainties,
however, regarding the tax treatment of specific transactions (including in connection with the Takeda
Acquisitions and Walmark Acquistion) and we may contest taxes assessed against us. As a result, there can
be no assurance that the Group’s current and future position on taxation matters will be accepted by the
relevant tax authorities. Such uncertainties in the applicable tax legislation or case law, as well as any
changes in interpretation by the tax authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s net
assets, financial condition and results of operations.

The Group is regularly subject to tax audits. While the Group believes that it has paid all material tax
liabilities and filed all material tax returns as of the date of this offering memorandum, and made
provisions that it believes to be adequate with respect to material tax risks resulting from current or past
tax audits, there can be no assurance that no tax deficiency will be asserted against the Group or that the
taxes assessed by the competent authorities pursuant to such tax audits will not exceed such provisions. All
the tax assessments issued for periods that were not yet finally audited may be subject to review.
Additionally, mergers and restructuring measures as well as the implementation of fiscal unities (steuerliche
_Organschaften) may change our overall tax position._

**_We could be adversely affected by changes to the composition of the Eurozone._**

If one or more countries in the Eurozone default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro,
there may be significant, extended and generalized dislocation in the financial markets and in the wider
European economy, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The departure of one or more countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of exchange rate
control laws. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries could
increase our exposure to changes in exchange rates and have negative effects on our existing relationships
with our suppliers or customers, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, or the threat of such
dissolution, could lead to increased market volatility, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our
business. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro
denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro would

50


-----

be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments could adversely affect our
operations.

Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential reintroduction of individual
currencies within the Eurozone could also have adverse consequences for us. Financial markets and the
supply of credit may be negatively impacted by recent developments in Greece and fears surrounding the
sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe, the possibility of the further
downgrading of or defaults on sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies
and uncertainties regarding the overall stability and sustainability of the euro given the economic and
political circumstances in individual member states.

A deterioration in general economic conditions caused by instability in the Eurozone could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The grant of security by STADA and the other Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in favor of the Existing Senior_**
**_Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities resulted in a default under STADA’s 2022 Notes and,_**
**_potentially, will result in a default under the outstanding Schuldscheindarlehen._**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contemplate the
grant of guarantees and security interests by German Holdco, STADA and the other Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The grant of the
guarantees was completed on July 18, 2018, and the grant of certain security interests in their property and
assets by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities was completed on December 20, 2018. This grant of security has resulted in a
default under the 2022 Notes and, potentially, if sufficient 2022 Notes accelerate, will result in a default
under the outstanding Schuldscheindarlehen, which will entitle individual holders of the 2022 Notes and
the Schuldscheindarlehen to demand repayment at a price of par plus accrued interest. While we have
available liquidity to repay any individual holders of 2022 Notes and/or Schuldscheindarlehen who demand
repayment of their principal and accrued interest, such defaults may result in a negative view of us in the
local credit markets. In addition, repaying such indebtedness will mean that we have fewer debt committed
funds available for acquisitions, capital expenditures or other purposes.

**_We may not be able to realize anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings._**

In connection with the STADA Acquisition, we identified certain operational efficiency and cost saving
measures that we started to implement in 2017. We have since identified additional measures, as described
in footnote (F) under ‘‘Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
_Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.’’ We may not be able to realize the anticipated efficiencies and_
savings targeted by these measures, either in the amount or within the time frame that we currently
anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than we expect.

Our estimated efficiency gains and cost savings are forward-looking and therefore subject to a number of
assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the underlying measures. Such
assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competition
risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions will turn out to be correct. In
addition, the estimated efficiency gains and cost savings may be offset by deterioration in the markets in
which the Group operates, increases in other expenses or challenges in the business. As a result, the
amount of efficiency gains and savings that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization
may differ significantly (and may be significantly lower or later) from the ones that we currently estimate,
and we may incur significant costs in reaching estimated gains and savings. Failure to achieve expected
efficiency gains and savings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will have control over the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the other Senior Secured Notes Collateral providers to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no

51


-----

acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the other Senior Secured Notes Collateral providers may, among
other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise
disposing of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including
repayments of indebtedness.

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture_**
**_and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with_**
**_proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the
Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security
Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others, (following
the designation of the Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement) those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and
future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’)) in
priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event
of a foreclosure of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the
then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any
proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Senior Secured Notes Collateral will, after all obligations
under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior
Term Facilities, Senior Secured Notes, (if the Revolving Credit Facility has not been designated as a super
senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility
and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior
Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively
subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof are
secured on a first-ranking basis with security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that also
secure our obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also
permits the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the
terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Designation Date’’), the Security Agent is
not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of
the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior
lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in
respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Participations’’) which
aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the ‘‘Majority
Senior Secured Creditors’’) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security
Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then creditors holding more than 50% of the total
second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total topco credit
participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

52


-----

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at
that time (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance
with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the
obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of
enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority
Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three
months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super
Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may at any time provide
immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement
action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the
Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such
determination, in accordance with the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to
enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain
security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event
which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act
(i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation
Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance
with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that it may in its
discretion require until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against any cost, loss or
liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes (such as indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of
holders of Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured
Notes Collateral consisting of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a
result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of_
_Liens.’’_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the
Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior Secured Notes, you
will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in the event of a default. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

**_The Additional Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that will be_**
**_granted as security for the Additional Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do_**
**_not secure the Additional Notes._**

The Additional Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
(which also secures the Existing Senior Secured Notes and debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement).
See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ Not all of our assets will secure the Additional
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture allows the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries to secure any future senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (which may be structurally
senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) with the property and
assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior
Secured Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and
the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank
equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes.

While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and
grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or
creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture set out a
number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or
guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among
other things, the amount recoverable under any Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided being limited or
security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security
Principles may affect the value of the security or guarantees provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy_**
**_our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in
connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many
factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory
restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of
the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes,
in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than
their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable
or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in
certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany and Russia, include restrictions on persons who
may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In
the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a
limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers.
Furthermore, entry into the security documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and
any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory
consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may
take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary
shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be
significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that
the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness

54


-----

secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to
secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof, such shares may also
have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the
entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been
pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of
an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time.
If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the
Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds
of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated
claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors’ remaining
assets.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders
of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not
permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties
may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised,
could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover,
if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such
Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Additional Notes being
offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral.

**_The granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance_**
**_periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests to secure the Senior Secured
Notes may create hardening or voidance periods for such Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security
interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt
may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, as the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in
certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening
or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has
been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.’’_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the granting of
security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes or under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof_**
**_or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany; the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; the Senior Secured Notes Collateral includes the shares of
certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions, and certain present and
future intercompany loan receivables held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its
subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights of
holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there
can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In
addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may
limit the realizable value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

55


-----

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with,
each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding
and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into
question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect
your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security
Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent_**
**_rather than directly to the holders of the Additional Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the
Additional Notes and the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors under the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the holders of the Additional Notes but to the
Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Additional Notes will not have any independent power to
enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising
under the security documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement. By accepting an Additional Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Additional Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against
us in the event of a default. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of
certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply.
There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial
owners of the Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will
be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence
governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests,
the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the
Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors owed to holders of the Senior Secured Notes under or in connection
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as applicable (‘‘Principal Obligations’’). All or part of the
pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions have been, or will be, granted to the Security
Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and do not, or will not, directly secure the Principal
Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in
the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of
the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of
the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security
interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes do not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests
except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes bear the risk of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been
tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are
unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not
receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
_the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Rights in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Additional
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims under the Additional Notes if we fail or are unable
to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. The creation of a valid security interest under a

56


-----

German law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain assets (such as bank accounts) may be
subject to the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or the security provider to a third-party
(for example, the notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over bank accounts). Any failure
to perfect any security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may result in the invalidity of the
relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Senior
Secured Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a
security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The Trustees and the Security Agent will not be
under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any
such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically without your consent or_**
**_the Trustees or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**
Under a variety of circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes
will be released automatically, including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Senior Secured Notes
Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, all of the
liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the Senior
Secured Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, subject to
certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of liens securing the
shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.
Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor,
obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of
the obligations secured by such security.
Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory
security interest created pursuant to a security document governed by German law might be released as a
matter of German law.

**_The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency_**
**_laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**
Our obligations under the Additional Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors and secured by security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (the ‘‘Security
Interests’’). The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The
Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There is a rebuttable presumption
that the ‘‘centre of main interest’’ as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation
No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In
addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral includes a pledge over the shares in certain of our
subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan
receivables held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of their subsidiaries incorporated under
the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or any other of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome
of such proceedings.
Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes against the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the enforceability of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may
also void the Security Interest or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee if the company is close to or near
insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an
overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant
jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

57


-----

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the
appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security
Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid
charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it
makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes return any
amounts paid under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any
amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the liability of each Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor or security provider under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests
is limited to the amount that will result in such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interests not
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The
amount recoverable from the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and security providers under the Security
Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in
making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished. See also ‘‘—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other
_limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes_
_Collateral.’’_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the
Security Interests created, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of
hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors
over others, or created such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a
prudent business person as a shareholder of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security
provider would have contributed equity to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider
or where the relevant beneficiary of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or security interest knew or
should have known that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a
filing for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered
insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the creation of the
Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about
to engage, in a business transaction for which the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security
provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts
beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or
security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created any Security Interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

58


-----

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that both the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Group are solvent, and will be so
after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in
determining whether a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless
of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or
security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or
not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Senior
Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees and Security Interests, see ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

Certain of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, England and
Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Enforcement of the
obligations under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against, and/or any Senior Secured Notes Collateral
provided by, as applicable, any such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses
available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the case
may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts
recoverable under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as
applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed or secured by a particular Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider under the
applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral is not in the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or
security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior
Secured Notes Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security
provider, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral would be in breach
of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory
laws and/or would cause the directors of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

In relation to public limited liability companies (Aktiengesellschaften, ‘‘AG’’) strict German capital
maintenance rules as set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, ‘‘AktG’’) apply. Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and/or security interests provided by an AG and/or its direct or indirect
subsidiaries in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company
(such as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will be, unless a specific exception applies, considered
disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of guarantees and/or
security interests by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose of supporting the
financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and, therefore, invalid.
Investors should note that STADA is incorporated in Germany in the form of an AG.

According to the wording of the law, both the prohibition of financial assistance as well as the capital
maintenance requirements described above are not applicable while a domination and/or profit and loss
transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) exists between the AG and the
shareholder on whose instructions the relevant guarantee and/or security interest is granted. However,
neither the Senior Secured Notes Indenture nor the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contain
any covenant requiring the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its respective subsidiaries to take any
efforts to implement or maintain a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement. Furthermore,
even in case a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement is in place and provided that certain
other requirements are met, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by an AG and/or its direct
or indirect subsidiaries (whether or not to support the acquisition of such AG) may be considered to be in

59


-----

violation of the capital maintenance rules and financial assistance restrictions, in which case such
guarantees and security interests can be void, unenforceable, restricted and/or subject to a redemption
claim against the beneficiary. In particular, under the prevailing view in German literature, the domination
and/or profit and loss transfer agreement exemption only applies if payments under the guarantee or
enforcement of the security interests, as applicable, do not cause the dominated entity (i.e., the AG) to
incur a balance sheet loss for which it cannot reasonably expect to be compensated for by the dominating
entity due to the financial condition of the dominating entity. Therefore, any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by an AG, including STADA and any of its
direct and indirect subsidiaries, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called ‘‘limitation
language’’) contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any other document governing the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively,
designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other
general statutory laws. With respect to the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement
exemption, such contractual enforcement limitations will apply notwithstanding the existence of a
domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement if and to the extent the enforcement of the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as applicable, provided by an AG,
including STADA and/or any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, will or is expected to, result in an
annual loss of the respective AG and such annual loss would not be, or cannot be expected to be,
compensated for by a compensation claim under the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement
that can be accounted for in the balance sheet of STADA at full (vollwertig).

Furthermore, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited
liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, ‘‘GmbH’’) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable
partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or
indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
relevant GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and
therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by a GmbH or
a GmbH & Co. KG, including by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are subject to certain contractual
limitations (so called ‘‘limitation language’’) contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any
other document under which any Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security
Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity
maintenance or any other general statutory laws. The pledge over STADA shares is granted by German
Holdco and is subject to ‘‘limitation language.’’

Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG or AG may be held invalid
pursuant to Section 138 of the German Civil Code (BGB) and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the
time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, amongst others, the
third-party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to
the detriment of the GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG or AG or other third-party creditors of such entity.

As a result, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated,
depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a
situation in which such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral cannot be
enforced at all. It is possible that a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, or any of their
creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency
of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s Guarantee or the security provider’s Senior Secured Notes
Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent
that any limitations on the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or Senior Secured Notes Collateral
apply, the Senior Secured Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the
applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider. Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior
Secured Notes Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior
_Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Transfer of the Additional Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Additional Notes._**

Because the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be,
and are not required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with
Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to
another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the
Additional Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Additional Notes to ensure that all offers and sales
of the Additional Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.
See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**_The Additional Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Additional Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Interests in the global Additional Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Additional Notes in
definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be issued in exchange for
book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be
considered owners or holders of Additional Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Additional Notes.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing
the Additional Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the global Additional Notes representing the Additional Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to
the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to
exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Additional Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Additional Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or
other actions from holders of the Additional Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it
will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and
Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable
such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless
and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own
book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures
to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise
of rights under the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Additional Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Additional_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

While the Additional Notes will form a single series with the Existing Senior Secured Notes under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Additional Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and therefore they will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Additional
Notes.

Furthermore, we cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Additional Notes;

- your ability to sell your Additional Notes; or

61


-----

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Additional Notes.

Future trading prices of the Additional Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Additional Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for
similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Additional Notes.

Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Additional Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a
market in the Additional Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so
and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making
activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and
regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Additional Notes. If no active
trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Additional Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims_**
**_of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Senior Secured_**
**_Notes Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are entitled to
payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for
distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or
is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (including
the holders of the Additional Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such
non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade
creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale
or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive
any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be structurally
subordinated to the creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any)
of the non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. In addition,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, subject to certain limitations, permits these non-Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence
constituting a default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be
secured. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain any limitation on the amount of other
liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized or incorporated
outside the United States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The
directors and executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United
States. Although the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors have or will
submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities
laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive
officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors. In addition, as
substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors
and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United
States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of
recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior

62


-----

Secured Notes Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws
of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors and the directors and executive officers who are not residents of the United
States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or
(ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the
United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Germany and The
Netherlands. For further information see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.’’

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control._**
**_In addition, under certain circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may have the right to purchase all_**
**_outstanding Senior Secured Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_**
**_tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) occurs, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will be required to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Senior Secured Notes that are tendered under any
such offer. If a significant principal amount of Senior Secured Notes is tendered, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Senior Secured Notes. However, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A
change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such
indebtedness. Any failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to offer to purchase the Senior Secured
Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may not necessarily
afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations,
restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely
affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership
or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated
net leverage ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any
third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases, all of the
Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or such third-party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in
whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of
Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

**_The term ‘‘all or substantially all’’ in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning under_**
**_relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of control has_**
**_occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding
Senior Secured Notes tendered. The definition of ‘‘change of control’’ in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture includes (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person. Although

63


-----

there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ it has no clearly
established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject
transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a
degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Senior Secured Notes.
The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Senior
Secured Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Senior Secured
Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a
credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Senior Secured Notes
by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, if at any time following the date of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture receive an
investment grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB� or better by S&P, and no default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as such
Senior Secured Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants will
cease to be applicable to such Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.’’ At any time when these_
covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash
dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes
will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Additional Notes may not become listed on the Exchange and, if listed, the Additional Notes may not remain_**
**_listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no
assurance that the Additional Notes will become listed. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot maintain
the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes
unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may cease to make
or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the Additional Notes on the
Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Additional Notes in the Channel Islands or
the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Additional
Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange,
failure to be approved for listing of the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the Additional Notes from the Official List of the Exchange
or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Additional Notes in
the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks or other tax consequences as a result of investing in the Additional_**
**_Notes._**

The Additional Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined
herein), an investment in the Additional Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of

64


-----

economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the
U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Additional Notes below their stated coupon
rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the Additional Notes by U.S.
Holders may have other significant tax consequences. See ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations.’’_

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of December 31, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and the other
transactions described under ‘‘Capitalization,’’ we would have had total financial indebtedness in the
amount of A6,161.0 million, consisting of the Notes, the Senior Term Facilities, the Revolving Credit
Facility, the STADA Existing Debt and certain local facilities. We anticipate that our high leverage will
continue to exist for the foreseeable future. See ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes.’’_

The degree to which we are leveraged as of the date of this offering memorandum, and following
completion of the Offering, could have important consequences to holders of the Additional Notes,
including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries to satisfy their
respective obligations with respect to the Additional Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating
rate of interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of
any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will_**
**_depend on cash from the operating companies of the STADA Group to be able to make payments on the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than
management of the equity interests it holds in its subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is
dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other
distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Additional Notes and
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof. Given the STADA Group’s international operations, it has
a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our

65


-----

Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries (primarily including the STADA Group)
and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits
under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries,
however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law and/or profit and loss transfer
agreements, if applicable, to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Additional Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limit the ability to upstream cash to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further
taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the
Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or
distributions on their equity interests, or transfer as profits under a profit and loss transfer agreement, if
applicable, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of
distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. The ability of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries which are party to a profit and loss transfer agreement to
transfer profit to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to the annual net profit as
determined by law and the respective receiving party is obliged to balance the annual net loss, if any, of the
transferring party. STADA is organized under German law which provides that dividends may only be
distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions
are not allowed under German law. Under the DPLTA STADA has undertaken to transfer its entire
annual profit (Gewinnabf¨uhrung) to German Holdco, and German Holdco is obliged to balance any annual
net loss of STADA. The subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that do not guarantee the
Additional Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Additional Notes or the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.

While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for
restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including_**
**_the Additional Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in
connection with acquisitions. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee
the Additional Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or that
benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Additional Notes. Any debt that our
subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Additional Notes to the extent that such
subsidiaries do not guarantee the Additional Notes or secure the Additional Notes, and other debt could
be secured or could mature prior to the Additional Notes. Although the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement and the Indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and its subsidiaries’ existing
debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Indentures do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.

**_Due to restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry-forwards under applicable_**
**_law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

A certain amount of our annual financing expenses (primarily including interest payments) is not
deductible under existing interest limitation rules, especially the German interest barrier rules
(Zinsschranke) as further described below. Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier
rules impose restrictions on the deductibility of interest expense for German tax purposes. The German
interest barrier rules generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess
of 30% of tax-adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the
same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single
business. Any nondeductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again
subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years. Any interest carry-forward may be
forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures, such as a change of the ownership structure.
Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the European Council adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 laying down
rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The
Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive I (ATAD I) contains five legally-binding anti-abuse measures, which all
member states have been required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since
January 1, 2017 onwards. Part of the package of measures has been the implementation of an interest
limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax
purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The
European Council has also adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches which
needed to be implemented by December 31, 2019, but have not been enacted in Germany to date. The
German ministry of finance issued a new draft bill on the implementation of the aforementioned directives
on December 10, 2019 and published an update of such draft bill on March 24, 2020. Amongst others,
according to this draft bill, expenditures for intercompany financing may be disallowed in the current and
future tax periods. The draft bill intends to broaden the existing rules on corresponding inclusions and
deductions of income and expenses and introduces provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches
from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and,
furthermore, introduces new arm’s-length provisions on intercompany financing that may ultimately limit
the deduction of interest expenses on intercompany loans. If the draft bill is enacted and depending on the
final wording of the new legislation, the introduction of aforesaid rules could result in higher taxable
income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future
tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the OECD BEPS-Initiative.

In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carry-forwards which have
partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax
loss carry-forwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be
forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such
restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or
voting rights transferred within a five-year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the
acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the
share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carry-forwards and current losses
will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the
built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carry-forwards survive to the extent taxable built-in
gains are are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. Currently, a proceeding is pending at the
German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) whether forfeiture upon ownership
changes of more than 50% are constitutional. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted,
they cannot be set-off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared
to the situation in which tax loss carry-forwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such
restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and
would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.

Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss
carry forwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a
subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for
the duration of the fiscal unity.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures contain covenants which impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other
things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
granted for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to_
finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and
activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore,
under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold
remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.’’ Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the_
Revolving Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we
will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving
Credit Facility, could result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with
respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with accrued
interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an
event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross
acceleration provisions, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If our creditors, including the
creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot
assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable us to repay the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those
amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not be_**
**_able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Additional
Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on our future performance and

68


-----

ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our business strategy as well
as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other
factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Additional
Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then-outstanding
amount under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
(including the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures one year before the Senior Secured Notes and two
years before the Senior Notes), the Additional Notes or any other debt that have incurred or may incur in
the future, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our
debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations
as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Additional Notes, on or before
maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of
our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Additional Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction
of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, limit, and
any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could
be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further
restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any
assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the
amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these
efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Existing and future drawings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any future variable interest rate debt_**
**_we incur in the future bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and_**
**_reducing our cash flow._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
interest rates, primarily under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which are based on the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (in each case subject to a
zero floor if less than zero) plus an applicable margin (based on a margin ratchet). These interest rates
could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations,
reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the
Additional Notes. Neither our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures contains a
covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of inter-bank lending rates,
regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are
conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of
daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate

69


-----

EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates
and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international
regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into
force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration
of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted.
For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer
persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the
‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the
current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR
benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions
by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or
LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as
well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in
reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the
FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended
mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (‘‘SONIA’’) across
sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest
rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term
priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of
SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries
related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over
administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to
LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA,
meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These
reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than
in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market
participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences
which cannot be predicted.

**_We may be subject to disputes, litigation and proceedings with past, present or future STADA shareholders._**

Prior to the consummation of the Takeover Offer, STADA did not have a controlling shareholder. We did
not acquire all STADA Shares during the Takeover Offer or the STADA Acquisition and have not
conducted a so-called ‘‘squeeze out’’ of minority shareholders after the Takeover Offer or STADA
Acquisition. We face the risk of disputes, litigation and proceedings that involve past, present or future
shareholders of STADA. Such disputes, litigation or proceedings may relate to actions taken by the
STADA management or supervisory board prior to the Takeover Offer, actions taken or compensation
paid in connection with the Takeover Offer, the STADA Acquisition or entry into the DPLTA or actions we
take vis-`a-vis minority shareholders now or in the future. For example, we are subject to ongoing appraisal
proceedings (Spruchverfahren) brought by certain minority shareholders to challenge the adequacy of
compensation payments under the DPLTA. In connection with any such disputes, litigation or proceedings,
we may incur substantial legal costs whether or not we are successful. If we are unsuccessful, we may also
be liable for damages or be required to increase compensation paid to such complainant past, present or
future shareholders. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events if determined adversely to us may have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.

**_The Additional Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Additional Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in addition
to the stated interest on the Additional Notes, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation will be
required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income), on a constant yield to maturity basis, in
advance of the receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of such holder’s regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because the Additional Notes will be issued with OID for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, they will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes and will

70


-----

have separate ISINs and common codes from the ISINs and common codes assigned to the Existing Senior
Secured Notes. See ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Additional Notes._**

Bain Capital and Cinven Funds indirectly own the majority of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer. As a result, our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to
affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to
approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our
shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as
noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For
example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in
the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that
compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are
complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
In addition, our shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the
STADA Group. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions,
divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which
would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions
might involve risks to you as a holder of Additional Notes.

**SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following tables present our selected consolidated financial information and have been derived from, and_
_should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements, that have been prepared in accordance with_
_IFRS and are included elsewhere herein and the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information,’’_
_‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ ‘‘Summary—_
_Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

_German Topco was organized in connection with the STADA Acquisition on April 18, 2017, and has_
_consolidated STADA and its subsidiaries since August 22, 2017. The financial information of German Topco_
_for 2017 covers only the stub period from April 18, 2017, to December 31, 2017. As a result, we believe that the_
_most meaningful way to discuss our Group’s selected consolidated financial information as of and for the years_
_ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is to present the Senior Notes Issuer’s selected consolidated financial_
_information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and STADA’s selected consolidated_
_financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017._

_Results of operations for prior years or periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the_
_full year or any future period._

**Overview**

We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on branded and
unbranded generics, with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 30,000 SKUs
covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product
portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries
and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA
region, Asia, South America and Australia.

We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales and we ranked ninth among OTC companies in Europe
as of December 31, 2019. Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is
bolstered by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local
market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective
manufacturing footprint comprising 21 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building on our
tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each year since 2014.
Our solid pipeline of new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a
strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our
business and further improve our profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, we generated sales of A2,608.6 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of
A885.3 million.

The products we sell are classified according to two divisions: Generics and Branded Products.

_Generics:_ Within our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost
alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in
our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and
hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with
competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations of originator
drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels
and local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics
division is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 18% of sales in our Generics division
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling products (and their respective therapeutic
areas) in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Epoetin zeta (anemia),
Tilidine, Tilidine/Naloxone (pain), Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Omeprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux),

-----

Pantoprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Diclofenac (pain, anti-inflammatory), Paracetamol (pain), Bisoprolol
(high blood-pressure), Amoxi-Clavulan (antibiotic), Fentanyl (analgesic). The largest countries by sales in
our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia,
Russia, France and Switzerland. We generated sales of A1,534.7 million and Management Adjusted
EBITDA of A439.3 million in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products division primarily includes branded OTC products, which are
typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests,
cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands
include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-go (Parkinson’s disease).
The market for products in our Branded Products division is generally characterized by market-driven
pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty being important factors for success.
Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 37% of
sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling brands
(and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in
our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Bortezomib (anti-cancer
medication, prescription required multiple myeloma), APO-go (Parkinson’s disease, prescription required,
available in 28 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in 28 countries), Zoflora (household
disinfection), Snup (rhinitis), Aqualor (rhinitis, sore throats, available in 18 countries), Nizoral
(anti-dandruff shampoo), Hirudoid (anti-coagulant), Vitaprost (prostate diseases) and Versatis (local
anesthetic). The largest countries by sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended
December 31, 2019, were: Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Italy. We
generated sales of A1,073.9 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A298.0 million in our Branded
Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Operating Divisions**

We report our results of operations in two divisions, Generics and Branded Products, which accounted for
59% and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our divisions
transact business with each other in the ordinary course of their operations. In accordance with transfer
pricing rules, services between our divisions are charged at market prices.

Products are assigned to each of our divisions on the basis of our marketing strategy. Marketing of generics
is generally price-driven, where we are dependent on reimbursements, and high product quality is a
necessary consequence of the stringent standards set by regulators. Where we determine that we are
competing in such an environment, and therefore mainly compete on the basis of price and our efficient
cost structure, we classify products into the Generics business. This mostly applies to prescription products
that are most heavily regulated and generally reimbursable. Where we are free to set the price of our
products, we classify them into the Branded Products division. This mostly applies to nonprescription
products that do not depend on reimbursements, but also to those of our prescription products that have
an established, highly recognizable brand and significant customer loyalty or low levels of competition. Our
OTC products and medical devices are globally assigned to the Branded Products division. Due to factors
such as differences in prevailing regulation and reimbursement regimes, brand recognition and
competition, the classification of our products may differ between countries. It may also vary over time due
to regulatory dynamics, with regulators redesignating prescription products as nonprescription products or
discontinuing the reimbursement of prescription products. Redesignations are only effective for future
periods and never apply retroactively.

**Geographic Areas**

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported our results of operations by country at the level of
each division, reporting the eight largest countries in terms of sales in the Generics division and the five
largest markets in the Branded Products division. Beginning with our consolidated financial statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we have discontinued reporting our results of operations by
country, and we do not intend to report such financial information going forward.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition include the factors described below.

79


-----

**_Regulation_**

Our industry is extensively regulated by a number of international and local regulatory authorities to
ensure that pharmaceutical products are effective and safe for use. Regulatory provisions typically require
us to obtain marketing authorizations before we are permitted to introduce new products into a market,
which drives our development costs. Other regulatory provisions establish high standards for the quality of
our products, services, raw materials, manufacturing and working conditions, which influence our cost of
sales, selling expenses, and general and administrative expenses.

In addition, regulation significantly affects our pricing of products and profitability. In certain markets,
such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Serbia, the costs of prescription products are generally
eligible for reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs. However,
regulators set a reference price for each pharmaceutical ingredient or substance group, which is a price
limit that caps the amount government health programs will reimburse. Pricing regulation generally
benefits generics companies such as us compared to manufacturers of branded originator products.
However, regulators may decrease their reference prices from time to time.

Tenders are another cost containment measure, primarily being employed by public institutions with
governments looking to source pharmaceuticals at the lowest price. Germany has a well-established public
tendering system that covers the majority of generic sales, in which we have operated successfully during
the periods under discussion. Similar tender systems are operated in the Netherlands and Spain. In Italy,
the United Kingdom and Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions such as
hospitals.

Cost containment measures by regulators and governments may also result in the redesignation of
prescription products as OTC products or the discontinuation of reimbursement for prescription products.
We believe that these measures play to our strengths, as end-consumers in need of pharmaceuticals that
are no longer reimbursable are more likely to prefer inexpensive generics such as our products over
costlier originator products. Similarly, a reclassification of a prescription product into an OTC product
means that price regulations no longer apply, thereby creating opportunities for us to leverage our brand
recognition to charge premium prices.

**Volume Growth**

We operate in a growing industry, which we believe influenced our sales during the periods under
discussion and represents a long-term trend. According to IQVIA, sales in the global generics market (top
66 countries) increased from A212 billion in 2017 to A216 billion in 2018 and to A225 billion in 2019, and
are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2020 to 2024. Based on IQVIA data, the major European
generics markets (Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy) are expected to grow at a
CAGR of 5.1% on average from 2020 to 2024.

We believe growth in the global pharmaceuticals market is being driven by long-term trends such as
population growth, aging societies, the increased incidence of chronic disease, advances in medical
therapies, increasing self-medication and health awareness. Growth in the global generics market was
additionally driven by increasing generics penetration in the global pharmaceuticals markets, due to cost
containment regulations incentivizing the use of generics to counteract the increasing cost pressure facing
government-sponsored health programs and recognizing that generics provide a high quality and
lower-cost alternative to originator products. Another key driver behind increasing generics penetration is
a wave of patent expirations.

In the generics space, we expect biosimilars to play an increasingly important role in the future, as they can
contribute significantly to cost control in national healthcare markets. In 2018, in Germany, the value of
biologics losing patent protection exceeded that of small-molecule pharmaceuticals losing patent
protection.

We also expect regulators to continue the trend of reclassifying prescriptions into OTC therapies, thereby
stimulating growth in the self-payment and self-care markets. According to IQVIA, the global OTC market
is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2020 to 2024 and the European OTC market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of 1.9% over the same period.

**_Economic Conditions_**

We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry, which is generally regarded as
a noncyclical industry. Noncyclical industries are characterized by a low correlation between the demand
for their products, which are typically nondiscretionary in nature, and fluctuations in general economic
conditions.

We believe that sales in our Generics division, which mostly comprises nondiscretionary prescription
products, are relatively independent of the economic conditions in our markets. As prices are mostly
regulated, frequently reimbursable by government or other health systems and with sales partly driven by
chronic diseases, volume demand in the Generics division is relatively stable throughout the economic
cycle. However, the state of a local economy may encourage governments to initiate cost containment
measures. Such measures may be favorable for us if they accelerate the transition from originator products
to generics or generics to branded OTC products, but they may be unfavorable if they lead to lower
reference prices. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019, 82% of our sales in Spain, 89% of our
sales in Belgium, 85% of our sales in France and 81% of our sales in Serbia derived from the sale of
Generics.

The state of the economy, however, impacts our results of operations in our Branded Products division,
which mostly comprises self-pay OTC products. The lack of reimbursement means that sales of OTC
products partly depend on consumers’ disposable income and general financial situation. A significant
portion of our Branded Products is nondiscretionary, such as pain relievers, cough and cold medicines,
sunscreens and diagnostics. However, some of our Branded Products are lifestyle driven and discretionary
in nature, such as cosmetics and vitamin supplements. Demand for these products is more susceptible to
fluctuations in the overall economy. Examples of countries in which Branded Products accounted for a
significant portion of our sales in 2019 include Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States
and Italy.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

Due to our international business operations, we are subject to both foreign exchange transaction and
translation risk. We adjust our results to remove the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that
affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. In 2019, we adjusted our results for losses
incurred with respect to a loan denominated in British pound sterling, and in connection with hedging
activities denominated in U.S. dollars.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our
respective functional currency. We currently operate 21 manufacturing facilities in twelve countries, and
sell our products in approximately 120 countries. As a result, a significant portion of our sales and expenses
are denominated in non-euro currencies. Where we are unable to match sales received in a foreign
currency with expenses paid in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency
exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that we are generally able to match sales with expenses incurred in
the same currency, such that part of our foreign exchange transaction risk is naturally hedged. We also use
derivatives such as currency futures and swaps to mitigate foreign exchange risk.

We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, in the preparation of our Financial Statements
we must translate assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all our operations with a functional currency
other than the euro into euro. Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates
may increase or decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, income and expenses, even if
their value has not changed in their local functional currency. Our principal exposure to translation effects
relates to the British pound sterling, Russian ruble and Serbian dinar.

**_Acquisitions and Disposals_**

Selective bolt-on acquisitions are part of our strategy, and we continually evaluate acquisition
opportunities. We seek to leverage acquisitions to unlock internal potential for organic growth, meaning
that we typically acquire either companies that we can use as a platform for our expansion into new
geographic markets or product portfolios that we can roll out in our numerous existing markets. Our focus
in terms of acquisitions is on markets that have high growth potential and on Branded Products, as this
division is characterized by a lower degree of regulation than Generics.

For example, in 2018, we acquired a majority stake in Bioceuticals; the distribution rights to Nizoral, an
anti-dandruff shampoo, in Europe and the MENA region, the trademark rights to Hedrin in Belgium,

81


-----

Spain and Portugal, the product rights for APO-go in Germany and Scandinavia, and the European
trademark rights to Ladival. In 2019, we acquired five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in
Europe, APAC and Latin America from GlaxoSmithKline, and Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription
and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer Health Business in
the Philippines, the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland, multiple, highly
recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines in Russia/CIS from Takeda, and the Walmark Group,
a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire
another pharmaceuticals portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer
healthcare brands. We also from time to time evaluate divestment opportunities.

Although we have completed several acquisitions and disposals during the periods under discussion, no
individual acquisition or disposition materially affected the comparability of our results of operations. The
Takeda Acquisition represents our largest acquisition since January 1, 2017. For the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019, a third-party due diligence report estimated that the Takeda CIS Assets generated EBITDA
of approximately A55.6 million (excluding synergies).

In addition, we have acquired, and may continue to acquire, additional shares in our existing subsidiaries
from time to time.

**_Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Expenses_**

Our results of operations are affected by costs of strategic initiatives and restructuring expenses, including
those associated with our Transformation Program. We continue to review our business processes with the
aim of increasing automation, centralization and harmonization across our international operations.

**_Seasonality_**

To a certain degree, our results of operations are affected by seasonality. For example, the results of our
Branded Products division typically fluctuate in line with the severity and timing of the cough and cold
season, which drives sales of our cold medicines such as Grippostad, Covonia, Aqualor, Snup and
antibiotics in the fourth and first quarter of each year. In a similar vein, the summer weather in the second
and third quarters influences our sales of sunscreen products such as Ladival. Our marketing expenses are
subject to the same seasonal drivers.

**_New Product Launches_**

Our sales are impacted by the number of product launches in each year. Particularly in our large and
mature markets product launches can be a key driver behind sales growth, as was the case especially in
Germany and Spain during the periods under discussion. Most of our product launches relate to new
Generics. Because Generics are not usually broadly advertised, these product launches have no material
impact on our marketing expenses. In our Branded Products division, however, our marketing expenses
correlate with the number of product launches, as the introduction of a new product is typically
accompanied by extensive marketing campaigns. When we launched our successful and fast growing sleep
aid Hoggar Night, for example, we incurred significant marketing expenses for a TV advertising campaign.

We launched 729, 650 and 670 products in the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For example, recent
product launches include Bortezomib (used for the treatment of multiple myeloma), Movymia (used for
the treatment of osteoporosis) and Dasatinib (anti-cancer medicine). The number of marketable products
that we are able to launch in any year is partly driven by regulation and the availability of new products and
is thus partly outside our control. As part of our strategy to expand globally into new markets, we are also
launching internationally products that have been particularly successful in their domestic markets. Recent
examples include the launches of Hedrin, Hoggar night, Fultium and Fructosin in the Portuguese,
Austrian, Belgian and Swiss markets, respectively.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16_**

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, we have
recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases that had previously been classified as ‘‘operating leases’’
under the principles of IAS 17. We recognized a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the
underlying asset and a lease liability representing our obligation to make lease payments. We elected to

82


-----

apply the modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16 and the cumulative effect of initially
applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, being January 1, 2019. As of
December 31, 2018, some of our facilities were leased and we also had vehicle leases and a number of lease
arrangements with office and equipment suppliers. The adoption of IFRS 16 has impacted the following
balance sheet line items as of January 1, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018:

- intangible assets increased by A7.1 million;

- property, plant and equipment increased by A51.9 million;

- other non-current financial liabilities increased by A 38.9 million; and

- other current financial liabilities increased by A20.1 million.

As a consequence of adopting IFRS 16, our EBITDA has been slightly positively impacted as rental
expense has been replaced with depreciation of our right-of-use assets and notional financing charges on
future lease liabilities. As a result, figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be
comparable to the results presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

**_Change in Reporting Entity_**

The Indentures currently require that we report to the holders of Notes the consolidated results of either
STADA, the Issuers or one of the parent entities of the Issuers. We have elected to report our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations on an ongoing basis at the level of German Topco, a parent
entity of the Issuers. However, the notes to German Topco’s consolidated financial statements include
reconciliation columns to the consolidated financial statements of each of the Senior Notes Issuer and the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which illustrate the differences in the financial conditions and results of
operations of German Topco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Although
German Topco has consolidated STADA and its subsidiaries since August 22, 2017, the comparability of
the STADA Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements (including the reconciliation to the
Senior Notes Issuer’s consolidated financial information contained therein) may be limited. For example,
certain consultancy costs related to the STADA Acquisition were incurred by German Topco and the
Issuers and only a portion of the debt incurred by the Issuers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement in connection with the STADA Acquisition was on-lent to STADA to refinance a portion of its
STADA Existing Debt. As a result, there may be material differences in the respective amount of
liabilities, financial results, income taxes and earnings.

**Explanation of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a description of the key line items presented in our Financial Statements. Our key line
items are reported on the basis of uniform accounting policies that are implemented at each entity within
our scope of consolidation.

**_Sales_**

Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered, provided that it is probable that
measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that control has been transferred to the buyer. It
must also be possible to reliably measure the company’s own costs incurred or to be incurred. Sales are
recognized before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions (rebates or discounts) at fair value of
the consideration received or receivable. Expenses due to provisions for warranties are deducted from
sales on the basis of estimates that are based on past experience expressed as a percentage of sales.
Discounts granted to health insurance systems are recognized as a reduction of sales, based on the relevant
contract. Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recorded in the same period.
Expenses related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the
sales are realized. With effect as of January 1, 2018, we have adopted a new standard for revenue
recognition in accordance with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). See note 3 to the
STADA Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

83


-----

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales includes the costs of raw material inputs and their conversion into marketable products,
including directly associated personnel expenses, as well as depreciation charges related to the relevant
production equipment. In addition, cost of sales includes valuation allowances for excess or obsolete
inventories and the purchase price of commercial goods sold or provided free of charge. Cost of sales also
includes amortization charges against intangible assets recognized in connection with drug approvals and
trademark rights. Cost of sales is recognized in the same period in which the associated income is realized.

**_Selling Expenses_**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and sales forces, selling expenses also comprises the costs for
advertising and marketing activities, including samples for doctors. Selling expenses also includes all costs
for the distribution of our products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, which are referred to as
discounts in kind, are not included in selling expenses but in net sales.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research expenses are costs that are incurred in relation to research activity aimed at new scientific or
technical findings. We do not engage in material proprietary research for new active pharmaceutical
ingredients, and our product portfolio is focused on products that do not require proprietary research. As a
result, we typically do not incur material research expenses.

Development costs are costs that result from the technical implementation of theoretical discoveries in
production and production processes and facilitate their commercial implementation. As a rule, it is the
objective of our drug development process to obtain national or multinational marketing authorizations for
our products, to capitalize all development costs incurred in relation to these authorizations and recognize
them as intangible assets. As described under ‘‘—Cost of Sales,’’ we then amortize these intangible assets as
part of cost of sales. Whenever development costs do not satisfy the requirements for capitalization, we
expense them in the periods in which they are incurred and report them under the line item development
costs. Costs related to the development of new products are usually capitalized, whereas costs for technical
and regulatory maintenance or the optimization of existing products are usually expensed as development
costs.

Development costs must satisfy the following criteria in order to be capitalized: (i) it is technically possible
for the relevant product to become marketable or otherwise available for use in our business in the future
(which generally equates to the grant of a marketing authorization); (ii) we have the intention and ability,
as well as the necessary resources, to achieve the marketability or utility of the relevant product; (iii) it is
probable that the future economic benefits accruing from the intangible asset will flow to the Group; and
(iv) the cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably.

**_Other Income_**

Other income primarily includes reversals of impairment losses and other write-ups on non-current assets
(excluding goodwill), income from asset disposals, income from insurance compensation and income from
indemnification payments as well as remaining other income not directly associated with functional costs.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other expenses primarily includes bad debt expenses, currency translation expenses, impairment losses on
non-current assets and certain taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to our sales, administration or
research and development functions.

**_Financial Result_**

Financial result is the net of financial income and financial expenses. Financial income primarily includes
interest income, distributions received from investments accounted for using the equity method and

84


-----

income from the measurement of financial instruments. Financial expenses are mainly composed of
interest expense and expenses from the measurement of derivative financial instruments.

**_Income Taxes_**

The item income taxes includes taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as
well as deferred taxes. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to our sales, administration or
research and development functions are included in other expenses.

**Results of Operations**

German Topco was organized in connection with the STADA Acquisition on April 18, 2017, and has
consolidated STADA and its subsidiaries since August 22, 2017. The financial information of German
Topco for 2017 covers only the stub period from April 18, 2017 to December 31, 2017. As a result, we
believe that the most meaningful way to discuss our Group’s selected consolidated financial information as
of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is to present the Senior Notes Issuer’s
selected consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2018, and STADA’s selected consolidated financial information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

(1) This column presents information for the year ended December 31, 2018, which serves as the comparative basis for the
corresponding information for the year ended December 31, 2019 in the Topco Financial Statements.

(2) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the
comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro-denominated sales in
each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period.

(3) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like-for-like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and
divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by
products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

(4) Represents audited financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The adjustment in respect of currency effects increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 by
A19.7 million. The adjustment primarily reflects the positive currency effects of the British pound sterling,
the Russian ruble and the Serbian dinar.

The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 by
A60.2 million. The adjustment primarily reflects the consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG
since September 30, 2018 as well as the sales contributions from the acquired medical dandruff shampoo
Nizoral product portfolio and the skincare product portfolio acquired from GSK.

_Constant-currency Sales_

Constant-currency sales increased by A240.8 million, or 10.2%, to A2,601.2 million in the year ended

Reported sales in our Generics division increased by A151.9 million, or 11%, to A1,534.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019, from A1,382.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
mainly due to higher sales volumes in Germany, the United States (where we have a license agreement
with Pfizer for the distribution of a product developed by Bioceuticals), Italy, Spain and France. Over the
same period, adjusted sales in the Generics division increased by A110.5 million, or 8%, to A1,534.7 million,
from A1,424.2 million. Generics remained stable at 59% of reported sales in the year ended December 31,
2019 compared to the previous period. Our top five active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales
of A188.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 12% of total sales in the Generics division,
compared to A135.7 million, or 10%, in the year ended December 31, 2018. With sales of A78.1 million, an
increase of A48.5 million, or 104%, from A29.6 million in the previous period, Epoetin Zeta was the

the year ended December 31, 2019, from A948.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Over the
same period, adjusted sales in the Branded Products division increased by A87.4 million, or 9%, to
A1,073.9 million, from A986.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of reported sales
was primarily the result of increasing sales in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. Branded Products
accounted for 41% of reported sales in both years. Our top five Branded Products accounted for sales of
A268.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 27% of sales in the Branded Products division,
compared to A215.8 million, or 25%, in the year ended December 31, 2018. With sales of A78.5 million in
2019, the newly-launched cancer treatment Bortezomib was the best-selling product in the Branded

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by A9.2 million, or 1%, to A1,417.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019,
from A1,408.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher
depreciation and amortization resulting from new product acquisitions, which offset the positive effects
from better procurement conditions and lower inventory costs due to a lower impact of purchase price
allocations than in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses increased by A43.0 million, or 8%, to A581.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019,
from A538.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the focused
strengthening of sales forces, and strong promotional and marketing campaigns in the United Kingdom,
Italy and Spain.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by A28.0 million, or 14%, to A228.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019, from A200.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to consultancy expenses in relation to the Sponsors’ Transformation Program.

_Research and Development Expenses_

ended December 31, 2019, from A72.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

Other income decreased by A35.6 million, or 51%, to A34.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019,
from A69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to non-recurring
income in the year ended December 31, 2018 in relation to the revaluation effect resulting from the capital
consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which was previously accounted for using the equity
method.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses increased by A63.1 million, or 45%, to A204.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019,
from A141.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher
impairments on intangible assets and increased severance payments as well as foreign currency losses.

_Financial Results_

Financial results increased by A54.2 million, or 21%, to a loss of A203.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019, from a loss of A258.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was

the DPLTA resulting from the Delisting Offer.

(1) This column presents information for the year ended December 31, 2017, which serves as the comparative basis for the
corresponding information for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the STADA Financial Statements.

(2) Prior to 2018, adjusted sales for the current financial year were adjusted for currency effects compared with the previous year
and for portfolio effects from new acquisitions. Due to the inclusion of historical exchange rates and the disregard of the
current portfolio, we are of the opinion that future sales potential is not sufficiently reflected in this figure. Since the 2018
financial year, all portfolio and currency effects have therefore been allocated to the previous financial year in order to
determine organic growth, and adjustments for currency and portfolio effects are shown solely as an adjustment to previous
year sales. The currency adjustment of the previous year’s sales is made using the exchange rates of the reporting year. The
portfolio effects consider the sales of the previous year as well as the sales of the reporting year, with the adjustment only
applied to the previous year’s figure.

(3) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the
comparability of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in
each period at the same foreign exchange rates as in the comparative period.

(4) The adjustment in respect of portfolio changes is a like for like adjustment that excludes the effect of investments in and
divestments of companies and products. In calculating this adjustment, we only take into account the organic sales generated by
products that were sold in both periods that are being compared.

(5) Represents audited financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The net changes to the portfolio as an adjustment to the reported sales for the year ended December 31,
2017 totaled A41.3 million, or an adjustment of 2%. The changes to the portfolio for the year ended
December 31, 2018 totaled A11.2 million, primarily due to the acquisition of branded products in
Argentina, the Nizoral product portfolio and the majority acquisition of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel
AG, and as a retrospective adjustment to the previous year totaled A52.5 million, primarily due to the
deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. Co. Ltd (‘‘STADA Vietnam’’).

We showed a negative currency effect resulting from the translation of local sales contribution into euro of
A54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or an adjustment of 2.4% to the reported sales for the
year ended December 31, 2017.

_Constant-currency Sales_

Constant-currency sales increased by A151.3 million, or 6.8%, to A2,360.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, from A2,209.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Products accounted for sales of A215.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, or 23% of sales in the
Branded Products division, compared to A220.9 million, or 23%, in the year ended December 31, 2017.
With sales of A71.3 million, an increase of 3.1 million, or 5%, from A68.2 million in the previous period, the
Parkinson’s medication APO-go was the best-selling active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Branded
Products division in the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by A38.5 million, or 3%, to A1,139.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018,
from A1,178.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to improved
purchasing conditions.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses increased by A24.1 million, or 5%, to A538.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018,
from A514.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher
marketing expenses in connection with product launches, particularly in Europe and CIS.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses decreased by A16.0 million, or 8%, to A183.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, from A199.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily
due to cost savings and lower-costs for consultancy services.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses increased by A4.8 million, or 7%, to A72.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, from A 67.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily
due to an extension of the APO-go product portfolio.

_Other Income_

Other income increased by A43.1 million, or 104%, to A84.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018,
from A41.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the capital
consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which was considered to be a special item in the
financial year ended December 31, 2018.

-----

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses decreased by A100.2 million, or 49%, to A103.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2018, from A203.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower
severance payments and reduced impairments on trade accounts receivable as well as reduced costs for
consultancy services.

_Financial Result_

Financial result decreased by A9.4 million, or 21%, to a loss of A35.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, from a loss of A44.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was
primarily due to lower interest expenses as a result of the refinancing of STADA Arzneimittel AG in 2018
at interest rates between 0.95% and 2.3% per annum, compared to between 0.8% and 4.23% per annum
for the previous year. In addition, the Group also financed itself at interest rates between 2.84% per
annum and 3.19% per annum, compared to between 2.9% and 5.5% per annum for the previous year.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes decreased by A20.6 million, or 39%, to A32.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018,
from A53.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the change in
tax status of STADA Arzneimittel AG. As a consequence, all deferred taxes from the previous parent
company were transferred to the new parent company, Nidda BondCo GmbH, while STADA Arzneimittel
AG was responsible for taxes on recurring compensation payments.

_Key Earnings Figures_

Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from favorable trends in
the Generics division in Germany and Europe as well as in the Branded Products division in Germany and
the United Kingdom.

_Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit increased by A185.8 million, or 97%, to A378.1 million in the year ended

the year ended December 31, 2018, from A233.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This
increase was primarily due to improved results of operations in the Generics division in Germany and
Europe (excluding Germany). Adjusted operating profit in the Generics division increased by 24% to
A307.9 million from A248.8 million in the previous period. The adjusted operating profit margin of
Generics was 22%, compared to 18% in the previous period. The reported operating profit margin of our

A165.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A99.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating profit in the Branded Products division in
Germany and the United Kingdom. Adjusted operating profit in the Branded Products division increased
by 21% to A189.4 million from A156.2 million in the previous period. The adjusted operating profit margin
of Branded Products was 20%, compared to 16% in the previous period. The reported operating profit

from A363.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Due to adjustments for special items,

93


-----

Management Adjusted EBITDA increased by 16% to A503.5 million from A433.9 million in the previous
period.

EBITDA in our Generics division increased by A66.7 million, or 23%, to A359.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, from A292.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily
due to improved results of operations in the Generics division in Serbia, Germany and Belgium. The
EBITDA margin in Generics was 26%, compared to 21% in the previous period. Management Adjusted
EBITDA in our Generics division increased by A56.8 million, or 19%, to A 359.6 million from
A302.8 million in the previous period. The Management Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Generics
division was 26%, compared to 22% in the previous period.

United Kingdom. The EBITDA margin of Branded Products was 26%, compared to 22% in the previous
period. Management Adjusted EBITDA in our Branded Products division increased by A33.1 million, or
16%, to A240.6 million from A207.4 million in the previous period. The Management Adjusted EBITDA
margin of our Branded Products division was 25%, compared to 22% in the previous period.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis are our operating cash flows and financing cash flows
from drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility and factoring facilities. The availability of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facility, are subject to certain conditions. As of
the date of this offering memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn in an amount of
A400.0 million. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments.’’

Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends
to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ As of the date of this offering
memorandum, the Covid-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our results and liquidity.
See ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments.’’ As of December 31, 2019, the Senior Notes Issuer had cash and
cash equivalents of A207.1 million (excluding A612.4 million of gross proceeds from our issuance of Senior
Secured Notes to fund the Takeda Acquisition, which were recorded as other financial assets, deposited
into escrow pending completion of the Takeda Acquisition and released from escrow on March 3, 2020)

95


-----

and we had A400.0 million in borrowings capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (excluding
A5.2 million of undrawn letters of credit). As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the transactions
set forth under ‘‘Capitalization’’, the Senior Notes Issuer would have had cash and cash equivalents of
A1,197.7 million and we would have had no remaining borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit
Facility, having borrowed A394.5 million and issued letters of credit in respect of trade liabilities in an
amount of A5.5 million. In addition, since December 31, 2019, we have used A145.0 million of cash to
acquire additional shares in one of our subsidiaries.

We believe that, based on our level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2019, our cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of
borrowings under factoring facilities and local facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital
expenditures and to service our debt for at least the next twelve months. The ability of our subsidiaries to
pay dividends and make other payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, legal prohibitions
on such payments or otherwise distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses
or other events could further reduce the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future
financing cash flows will be limited by the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may
have important negative consequences for you. See ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements.’’ In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our_
cash flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Additional
Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.

The proceeds from the Offering will be used as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**_Cash Flows_**

_Year Ended December 31, 2019 of the Senior Notes Issuer Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018_
_of the Senior Notes Issuer_

_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A24.5 million, or 9%, to a cash inflow of A308.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019, from a cash inflow of A284.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2018. This increase was primarily due to a significantly higher gross cash flow resulting from a significant
increase in EBITDA. There were also cash inflows in connection with the increase in trade accounts
payable, which were countered by higher cash outflows resulting from the increase in inventories and trade
accounts receivable.

96


-----

_Cash Flow from Investing Activities_

Cash flow from investing activities decreased by A35.3 million, or 12%, to a cash outflow of A265.0 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019, from a cash outflow of A300.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to significantly lower payments for investments in
intangible assets. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we made payments for investments in intangible
assets in the amount of A161.7 million, as compared to A280.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2018. Of the payments made in the year ended December 31, 2019, A135.1 million related to significant
investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of our product portfolio (of which
A84.2 million were made in connection with the acquisition of a branded products portfolio in the United
Kingdom), as compared to A255.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Within the scope of
business combinations, we made net payments of A47.5 million for the Biopharma acquisition. In the year
ended December 31, 2019, proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A31.5 million, as
compared to A9.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Proceeds from the disposal of shares in
consolidated companies as well as from the disposal of non-current assets held for sale related to dividends
of Stellapharm J.V. (formerly STADA Vietnam J.V.), which was previously accounted for using the equity
method, and constituted partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth
quarter of 2017 to sell the shares held by STADA in this company as of December 31, 2019 as well as the
final purchase price payment.

_Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

Cash flow from financing activities increased by A98.3 million, or 100%, to a cash outflow of A196.8 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019, from a cash outflow of A98.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2018. This increase was primarily due to significantly lower borrowings of funds compared to the year
ended December 31, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we issued temporary notes, with a nominal
volume of A600 million, in order to finance the Takeda Acquisition, which was completed in March 2020.
As of December 31, 2019, the proceeds from the temporary notes were deposited into an escrow account,
pending completion of the Takeda Acquisition. The relevant credit balance generated by the retention of
the proceeds on the escrow account was recorded as an inflow of cash from financing activities.
Repayments of financial liabilities also decreased in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018, when certain creditors of STADA became entitled, in accordance with the
financing conditions, to prematurely terminate certain bonds, promissory note loans and bank loans due to
the Takeover Offer in 2017. Also, in the second quarter of 2018 we made a scheduled repayment of a
STADA Arzneimittel AG bond in the amount of A347.1 million. In addition, in the year ended
December 31, 2018, we made payments of A1,447.0 million in connection with the Delisting Offer and the
increase in our controlling interest in STADA.

_Year Ended December 31, 2018 of STADA, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 of STADA_

_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A57.4 million, or 22%, to a cash inflow of A320.3 million in
the year ended December 31, 2018, from a cash inflow of A262.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2017. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in gross cash flow as a result of a strong
annual result and lower income tax payments. In addition, there were significantly lower cash outflows in
connection with inventories and slight cash inflows in connection with trade accounts receivable compared
with significant cash outflows in the previous year. In addition, significantly lower use from deferrals for
healthcare insurance settlements was recorded. On the other hand, there were significantly higher cash
outflows from the settlement of trade accounts payable, which were high at the end of the previous year.

_Cash Flow from Investing Activities_

Cash flow from investing activities increased by A177.7 million, or 145%, to a cash outflow of A300.3 million
in the year ended December 31, 2018, from a cash outflow of A122.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to payments in the amount of A280.3 million for
investments in intangible assets, compared to A70.2 million in the previous year, primarily relating to the
acquisition of the rights to the Nizoral for the EMEA region as well as the reacquisition of the trademark
rights to Ladival. In addition, there were net inflows from the acquisition of the majority interest in
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents acquired at the time of
acquisition exceeded the purchase price.

-----

In 2018, we spent a total of A236.2 million on acquisitions as part of business combinations and significant
investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of our product portfolio, compared to
A42.3 million in the previous year. Investments in other intangible assets amounted to A24.9 million in the
year ended December 31, 2018, compared to A30.7 million in the previous year. These comprise, in
particular, insignificant individual payments for the development and acquisition of dossier submissions for
active substance approvals.

Payments for investments in property, plant and equipment in 2018 amounted to A48.1 million, compared
to A55.0 million in the previous year. This also includes investments in production sites, manufacturing
facilities and test laboratories, for which additions amounting to a total of A22.8 million were recorded in
the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to A36.3 million in the previous year. Payments for
investments in financial assets in the year ended December 31, 2018 were A0.3 million.

As a result of disposals, we recorded an inflow of payments totaling A9.2 million in cash flow from investing
activities in financial year 2018, compared to A5.7 million in the previous year. Income from the disposal of
consolidated companies related to dividends of STADA Vietnam measured at equity, which are partial
payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the sale of
STADA’s shares as of December 31, 2019.

_Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

Cash flow from financing activities increased by A307.5 million, or 135%, to a cash inflow of A79.7 million
in the year ended December 31, 2018, from a cash outflow of A227.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in financial liabilities due to
the loans granted to STADA by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. This was offset by higher repayments of
financial liabilities. This resulted in particular from the creditors of STADA Arzneimittel AG becoming
entitled, in accordance with the financing conditions, to prematurely terminate bonds, promissory note
loans and bank loans due to the takeover in 2017. In this context, a partial amount of A360.2 million was
made due prematurely in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018 we scheduled the
repayment of a bond in the amount of A347.1 million.

**_Net Working Capital_**

Net working capital as defined by us consists of inventories and trade receivables less trade payables. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.’’ The following table summarizes
our change in net working capital in terms of cash flows for the periods indicated:

In the year ended December 31, 2019, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A128.9 million, compared to a cash outflow of A93.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The
change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A145.8 million and was primarily due to a
cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in Germany, Serbia, Russia and the United
Kingdom, due, among other things, to stocking up for the flu season and safety stock. The change in trade
accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of A60.3 million, driven by a cash-effective increase in
trade receivables, mainly of our subsidiaries in Italy, the United Kingdom and Belgium, primarily as a
result of a strong sales performance in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, which was
partly offset by a significant decrease in trade receivables of our subsidiaries in Russia. The change in trade
accounts payable accounted for a cash inflow of A77.2 million and resulted primarily from our subsidiaries
in Germany, the United Kingdom and Serbia, partly due to reporting date effects.

In the year ended December 31, 2018, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A95.9 million, compared to a cash outflow of A123.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The
change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A44.9 million and was primarily due to a
cash-effective increase in the inventories of our subsidiaries in Russia and Serbia. The change in trade
accounts receivable accounted for a cash inflow of A0.5 million, driven by a decrease in overall factoring
volume, contrary there was a decrease in trade receivables, especially in our subsidiaries in Belgium,
Serbia, Germany and France. The change in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash outflow of
A51.5 million and resulted primarily due to the settlement of significant invoices of our German companies,
especially STADA, for consultancy services, as well as from reporting date effects, especially in Serbia.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, our net change in working capital was a cash outflow of
A123.1 million. The change in inventories accounted for a cash outflow of A64.6 million and was primarily
due to additional inventories of our subsidiary ALIUD PHARMA, which were necessary to ensure
compliance with health insurance tenders. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash
outflow of A31.5 million, driven by decreasing factoring volumes. The change in trade accounts payable
accounted for a cash outflow of A27.0 million and resulted primarily from reporting date effects, especially
in Russia.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures mainly consist of investments in maintenance (including replacements) and
growth expenditures (which relate to our expansion into new markets and increased penetration of existing
markets). We finance our capital expenditures with cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from
financing activities.

The table below sets forth our capital expenditures based on cash flows for the periods indicated.

(1) Significant investments and acquisitions relate to investments in intangible assets and business combinations according to
IFRS 3.

(2) Adjusted capital expenditure includes maintenance, other investments in tangible assets and financial assets as well as other
minor investments in various intangible assets.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions decreased by A53.6 million, or 23%, to
A182.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, from A236.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2018. This decrease was primarily due to significantly lower payments for investments in intangible assets
in the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily relating to the acquisition of five skincare brands and a
pediatric cough remedy from GlaxoSmithKline through our British subsidiary Thornton & Ross, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, when payments related primarily to the acquisition of the
rights to Nizoral for the EMEA region as well as the reacquisition of the trademark rights to Ladival.
Adjusted capital expenditures increased by A40.6 million, or 55%, to A113.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019, from A73.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly
driven by major investments in tangible assets in relation to the expansion of production facilities at our
subsidiaries in Vietnam, Serbia and the United Kingdom.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions increased by A193.9 million to
A236.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A42.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2017. This increase was primarily due to significantly higher payments for investments in intangible assets,
especially relating to the acquisition of the rights to Nizoral for the EMEA region and the reacquisition of
the rights to Ladival. In the context of business combinations, there were net inflows from the acquisition
of a majority interest in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents
acquired at the time of acquisition exceeded the purchase price. Adjusted capital expenditures decreased

by A12.8 million, or 15%, to A73.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, from A 86.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was mainly driven by lower expenditures for tangible assets.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a
current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We license certain of
our Generics products, none of which individually represents a material portion of our business. We record
provisions for estimated warranty claims in connection with product returns, based on historical data. As of
December 31, 2019, our provision in respect of warranties was A13.6 million. In the periods under
discussion, the majority of our product returns were due to returns of excess stock by certain customers in
our Branded Products division. We also regularly enter into guarantees of indebtedness drawn by other
entities within our Group. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we recorded A11.8 million relating to lease
expenses, including expenses under short term lease commitments and leases relating to low-value assets
that were not recorded on the Senior Notes Issuer’s balance sheet.

Furthermore, on July 18, 2018, in the context of the STADA Acquisition, we and certain of our subsidiaries
organized in Belgium (Eurogenerics SA), England and Wales (Internis Pharmaceuticals Limited and
Thornton & Ross Limited), the Netherlands (Centrafarm B.V.), the Republic of Ireland (Clonmel
Healthcare Limited) and Northern Ireland (Crosspharma Limited), granted guarantees in favor of the
Existing Notes and our obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Additionally on
such date, Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U., one of our subsidiaries organized in Spain), granted guarantees in
favor of our obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

Furthermore, July 26, 2019, in the context of our ongoing obligations under our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, one of our subsidiaries organized in England and Wales (Natures Aid Ltd.), granted
guarantees in favor of the Existing Notes and our obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement.

**Developments in any of these risk areas could have a material effect on our results.**

Risks that could have a significant influence on the net assets, financial position and results of operations
of the Group are described below. Risks are reported in the form of net risks, i.e., risks that include the
measures taken to manage the risk, and by the individual segments. If no segment is explicitly referenced,
the described risks affect both the Branded Products and the Generics divisions. As yet unknown risks and
those that have been assessed as insignificant could also influence net assets, financial position and results
of operations.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Financial Risks**

We have exposure to liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, default risk, transfer price risk,
impairment risk and tax risk. Our risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks
we face. We counter financial risks with finance policy methods and specific risk management.
Developments in any of these risk areas could have a material effect on our results. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and
the Financial Statements included elsewhere herein for further details on these and other risks we face.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, the lack of available credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuations in the operational course of our business. The objective
of our liquidity management is to ensure the solvency and financial flexibility of our Group at all times
through sufficient liquidity reserves and ready access to credit lines. Our financing comprises short-term
and long-term borrowings from banks, promissory notes, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, we generate
substantial operating cash flows and have access to credit financing from various banks that can be utilized
as needed.

**_Currency Risk_**

Due to our international business operations, we are subject to risks arising from exchange rate
fluctuations. These particularly result from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British pound
sterling and Serbian dinar in relation to the euro. A currency risk consists of potential changes in value,
especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other than the respective functional currency, or as a
result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk). However, we believe that we can mitigate this risk to
a certain extent through natural hedges and the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to
hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, we used foreign exchange futures contracts and interest and currency swaps. The
maturity dates of forward contracts are generally set as necessary to match our anticipated cash flows. The
remaining terms of the contracts are currently up to one year.

Furthermore, currency risks also exist in relation to the translation of the balance sheet items, as well as
the conversion of income and expenses of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone (translation risk). In this
connection, the current political conflict between Ukraine and Russia, as well as negotiations between the
United Kingdom and the European Union over Brexit, could indirectly continue to have a negative
influence on exchange rates and our results of operations.

For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as
of December 31, 2019 showed that in financial year 2019, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional
currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of
approximately A2.0 million. At the same time, an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency in
relation to the British pound sterling of 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately
A24.9 million.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are subject to interest rate risks from financial assets and financial indebtedness, primarily in the
Eurozone and Russia. We calculate existing interest rate risks with sensitivity analyses that show the effects
of changes in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as on equity.
Should the sensitivity analysis show that interest rate fluctuations could lead to significant impacts, we
could use derivative hedging instruments to avoid the risk.

A sensitivity analysis from STADA showed that an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in
2019 would have resulted in additional income of A0.3 million, compared to A7.5 million in the previous

101


-----

year, and a decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in additional income
of A1.9 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2019, compared to additional expenses of
A2.1 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2018.

Following the Offering and subject to the assumptions set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ our indebtedness
and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (which will
bear a floating interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR), the Senior Notes, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes and the Additional Notes (each which have a fixed rate coupon).

**_Default Risks_**

We are exposed to default risk in our operating business or as a result of financing activities if contracting
parties fail to meet their obligations. To avoid default risks in financing activities, appropriate credit
management processes are in place and such transactions are generally only entered into with
counterparties of sufficient credit quality.

Risks of default also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. We therefore strive to maintain
business relations only with counterparties of sufficient credit quality. In addition, we partly use credit
support such as guarantees, loan insurance or the transfer of assets to safeguard ourselves against default
risk. Overdue receivables are continuously monitored and potential default risks are addressed through
value adjustments. In addition, there is the risk that in a difficult economic and financial environment,
national healthcare systems may delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners, directly or
indirectly increasing the risks of default.

**_Transfer Price Risks_**

We have an international network of subsidiaries and carry out strategic functions centrally through
STADA Arzneimittel AG. As a result, an overarching tax transfer pricing model for the billing of
intragroup services is of increasing importance. Potential risks of the non-recognition of these transfer
prices for tax purposes (for example, from retroactive tax claims of the local tax authorities against one of
our subsidiaries) are limited by the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a
comprehensive definition of transfer prices in our Group-wide policies. There can be no assurance,
however, that transfer prices will be recognized by the competent authorities.

**_Impairment Risks_**

The valuation rates of assets presented on our consolidated balance sheet are subject to changes in market
and business relationships and thereby to changes in fair value. Our annual and case-related impairment
test may result in significant charges against earnings and adverse impacts on balance sheet ratios. This
particularly applies to goodwill primarily resulting from purchase price allocations linked to previous
acquisitions, and for other intangible assets. All relevant risks are considered in the context of the
preparation of the STADA Financial Statements and the Topco Financial Statements.

**_Tax Risks_**

Our business activity in the national markets is subject to the applicable national or international tax laws
and regulations. Changes to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as different law
interpretations can result in risks with impacts on tax expenses, tax revenues, tax receivables and tax
liabilities. Our tax department identifies, evaluates and systematically monitors tax risks and takes
appropriate measures to reduce tax risks. Furthermore, we take advantage of our international network
and of our centralized strategic function, which allow us, among the other things, to have an efficient tax
transfer pricing model for the billing of the Group’s internal services. Potential risks of non-recognition of
these transfer prices for tax purposes (e.g., from retroactive tax claims of the local tax authorities against a
subsidiary of our Group) are limited by our internal procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer
prices included in our Group’s guidelines.

102

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the STADA Financial
Statements and the Topco Financial Statements is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a
certain extent, we make estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience
as well as other factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the
estimates and assumptions are constantly reevaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual
circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting
issues concerned are detailed below.

**_Purchase Price Allocations_**

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods used for purchase price allocations are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least
once a year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill at STADA is allocated to
cash-generating units aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to
STADA’s two operating segments for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill.

We carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take
place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of
each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit, including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in
use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. Following this three-year period, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the
expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions are made in order to determine the
value in use, including assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the
discount rate and currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually
according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally
determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e., when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications
that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is reevaluated and impairment losses
are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an
impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized
cost.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests
and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these
assets are compared with their carrying amounts and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For
this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. In our case the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are relating to the umbrella brands of,
in the case of the STADA Financial Statements, Hemofarm, Pymepharco and Vannier, all capitalized in
the context of their respective acquisitions, and, in the case of the Topco Financial Statements, Hemofarm
and STADA, all capitalized in the context of the STADA Acquisition. If the reasons for recognizing an
impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the acquisition
cost.

103


-----

Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests.
Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing
an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, we assess whether indications
for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g., if certain defined critical values are exceeded, the
asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value
less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted cash flow
method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the weighted
average cost of capital, which is determined individually for two operating divisions with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are reported under the heading ‘‘Other expenses.’’

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, our
cash-generating units are defined at the level of individual assets within the reportable divisions of
Branded Products and Generics of STADA.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the heading ‘‘Other income.’’

For items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

**_Development Costs_**

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

**_Valuation Allowances on Receivables_**

We make valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of net receivables and past experience in relation to bad
debts as well as customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of
valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will
exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial position of the
customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of receivables relate
particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in Central and Eastern European countries.

**_Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

We maintain defined benefit plans in various countries, according to which the amount of pension benefits
depends on the employee’s pensionable remuneration and length of service or which contain guarantees
not permitting recognition as defined contribution plans. Pension obligations are measured in accordance
with actuarial principles using the projected unit credit method. The pension provisions recognized in the
balance sheet correspond to the present value of the defined benefit obligation on the balance sheet date
less the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for any limitation of the benefit asset. In addition to earned
pensions and entitlements, the calculation also includes future salary and pension increases. For our
German companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the
Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. In other countries in which we operate, country-specific mortality tables
are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate will be
based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates at the reporting
date. In countries where there is no liquid market for corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined on

104


-----

the basis of market yields on government bonds. Changes to the assumptions can significantly influence the
amount of future pension costs.

The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized with no effect on income. It
differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions and financial
assumptions as well as experience-based amendments. They are recognized directly in equity with no effect
on income in the period in which they occur (‘‘other comprehensive income’’ or ‘‘OCI’’). The relevant
amounts are reported separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the
calculation of the portion of the interest income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, IAS 19
requires the application of the discount rate underlying the obligation. The remainder of the actual income
from plan assets is to be recognized directly in other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss.
The current service cost is recognized in staff costs of the individual functional areas. All past service costs
that arise in the financial year shall be recognized immediately through profit or loss.

Several of our subsidiaries also grant their employees defined contribution plans. In these cases, we pay
defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a
voluntary basis without incurring additional liabilities. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans are
recognized as expenses in the respective period in the relevant functional areas.

The other non-current provisions contain ‘‘anniversary provisions’’ and other long-term employee benefits.
Commitments to anniversary payments are accounted in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 and
other long-term employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not
recognized without an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately
reported as income or expenditure in the relevant functional areas. Furthermore, there is a working time
accounts plan that is accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.

**_Other Provisions_**

We set aside other provisions in case current legal or constructive obligations to third parties arise from
past events that will likely lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that can be reliably
determined. An outflow of assets embodying economic benefits is considered as probable if it is more
likely to occur than not. Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into account all
recognizable risks, offers the best possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the obligations. Any
existing reimbursement claims by third parties are not netted with other provisions. Expenses from the
creation of provisions are allocated to functional costs according to where they arise. If changes in
estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other provisions are reversed on a pro rata basis and
recognized through profit and loss under the item where the original expense was recognized.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. We set aside provisions in the event of a present external obligation
and a probable outflow of resources (meaning that an outflow is more likely to occur than not). Provisions
in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on how we estimate the prospects of the success of
these methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates
and can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent
liabilities.

**_Provisions for Warranties and Discounts_**

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for warranties may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g., discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes include actual taxes on income as well as deferred tax liabilities. The tax receivables and
liabilities recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and
outside Germany in respect of the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as from previous years, if
applicable. The tax receivables and liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the

105


-----

reporting date or known and already concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable profit is
generated.

Deferred tax liabilities are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities
and their valuation rate in the IFRS financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent
that it is probable that a taxable profit will result against which the temporary difference can be utilized as
well as for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences taxable
in the future. We determine deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the reporting date or
those that have already been resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax receivables and
liabilities are offset if these relate to the same taxation authority.

The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that
are recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with
an effect on deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise.

We operate in various countries and are obligated to pay income taxes in each respective tax jurisdiction.
In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred tax liabilities in the Group, the expected
income taxes as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain balance
sheet items according to IFRS are determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed
deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on current and deferred taxes and thus
on the net assets, financial position and results of our operations in the respective periods. Furthermore,
we consider increasingly important the existence of a comprehensive tax transfer pricing model for the
remuneration of intragroup services within the Group. Possible risks of non-recognition of these transfer
prices for tax purposes are limited by the introduction of appropriate communication methods and an
overarching definition of transfer pricing in the form of Group-wide policies.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

We counter risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively
used to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and
investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

Derivative financial instruments exist in the context of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or
loss as well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and
hedges of net investments in a foreign operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging
instruments in the context of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39.

We use cash flow hedges to protect against fluctuations of cash flows associated with an accounted asset or
an accounted financial liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the fair value of these
hedging instruments are recognized with no effect on income in the amount of the effective part of the
hedging relationship directly in equity. A transfer to the income statement takes place in the period when
the underlying hedged item becomes effective. The ineffective part of the changes in value is, however,
recognized directly in the income statement.

In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of accounted assets or accounted
liabilities or fixed off-balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions
are recorded in our income statement as if they were changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged
items. If the requirements for hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously
hedged items are adjusted on the basis of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation are treated according to the same accounting policies as cash flow hedges.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not yet made use of the option to designate financial
liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates,’’ are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

As of December 31, 2019, we hold derivatives without hedging relationship in the form of currency swaps.

**Global Pharmaceutical Industry Overview**

The global pharmaceutical market is a growing industry with growth expected to be driven primarily by
important sector growth trends such as an aging population in the world’s developed economies, the
launch of new and enhanced treatment options for patients, and the increasing significance of emerging
markets.

The United States is the largest pharmaceutical market globally, contributing approximately 44.2% to total
pharmaceutical sales in 2017. Historically there has been a favorable pricing environment and a generally
higher utilization of pharmaceuticals in the United States, compared to other developed markets. Europe
is the second largest market with Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy (the ‘‘EU5’’)
contributing approximately 15.8% to total pharmaceutical sales and Japan is the third largest
pharmaceutical market contributing 7.6%. China and the rest of the world market make up the remaining
32.4% of pharmaceutical sales.

**Product Segments**

The pharmaceutical industry is comprised of a broad range of product segments including patent protected
branded prescription drugs, generic prescription drugs, OTC products and nutraceutical products. Patent
protected branded prescription drugs include both chemical pharmaceutical products and biologics.
Generic prescription drugs include simple generics, branded generics, specialty generics and biosimilars.

**_Patent Protected Branded Prescription Drugs_**

Patent protected Branded prescription drugs involve a significant commitment of time and money in
research and development (‘‘R&D’’) and depend upon patent protection laws to recuperate the significant
initial investment and to compensate for other drugs in the pipeline that were unsuccessful. They are sold
under branded names and can be either chemical pharmaceuticals, which are chemically synthesized small
molecules, or biologics, which are large complex molecules extracted from a variety of natural sources
(human, animal or microorganism) and are used to treat a range of diseases and medical conditions.
Examples of biologics include vaccines, gene therapies and cellular therapies.

**_Generic Prescription Drugs_**

Generic drugs are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of reference branded prescription drugs,
typically sold under their generic chemical names at prices below those of their branded drug equivalent.
These drugs can be introduced into the market once patents and regulatory exclusivity have expired on a

107


27APR202021560929


-----

given branded prescription drug, and are generally required to meet similar governmental standards as
their branded name equivalent and also must generally receive regulatory approval prior to their sale.
Governments, in an effort to control rising healthcare costs, are increasingly mandating the use of generic
drugs instead of the more expensive branded equivalents as they often provide similar benefits after
passing through the approval process.

**_Simple Generics_**

Simple generic drugs are marketed and sold using only the generic chemical name (International
Non-Proprietary Name (‘‘INN’’)) and are not given a brand name.

**_Branded Generics_**

Branded generic drugs are marketed under another company’s specific brand name which is different to
the brand name of the original product.

**_Specialty Generics_**

Specialty generics differ from original products in terms of their formulation or method of delivery. They
sometimes require a new drug application to obtain regulatory approvals. These drugs are enhanced in
terms of drug delivery, manufacture, or reformulation technology, and face a more stringent regulatory
approval process than generic prescription drugs. They may also be referred to as added value generics,
new therapeutic entities, or hybrids. Specialty generics take at least three to four years to be developed for
registration.

**_Biosimilars_**

Biosimilars are an emerging class of biologic drugs. While generics are based on chemically synthesized
small molecules that are identical to their branded originator counterpart on an atomic scale, biologics are
based on large and complex molecules extracted from natural sources and are therefore very difficult to
replicate. However, manufacturers have been able to create molecules that are highly similar to approved
original molecule biologics and obtain regulatory approval. These molecules are offered at a more
affordable price and are referred to as biosimilars. Biosimilar drugs can be thought of as the generic
versions of biologics and are generally required to have no clinically meaningful differences to the original
molecule biologics in order to obtain regulatory approval.

**_OTC Drugs_**

OTC or non-prescription medicine can be purchased by a consumer without the supervision of a health
care professional such as a physician and without a prescription. OTC drugs are tried and tested products
which have been in the market for many years and are not typically protected by patents but rely on brands
to differentiate the products. As there are very few truly global OTC brands, there is a prevalence of local
market leaders. As a result, local brands have the potential to be successful in niche markets.

**_Nutraceutical Products_**

Nutraceuticals are foods or food extracts that are used for medical benefits, and often come in the form of
a dietary supplement. The increasing trend for ‘‘natural’’ products can be seen across consumer segments,
and is also taking place in the pharmaceutical industry due to increased focus on general wellness and
healthier lifestyles. Products based on naturally sourced active ingredients can have the same
pharmaceutical effectiveness as standard pharmaceutical products, often with better safety profiles and
more limited side effects.

**Industry Dynamics & Drivers**

There are a number of fundamental characteristics and trends that have historically impacted, and which
we believe will continue to impact, the growth of the broader pharmaceutical industry over the mid to
long-term.

**_Resilient, Non-cyclical Industry_**

The pharmaceutical market is resilient and largely non-cyclical. Spending on prescription and OTC drugs
is non-discretionary in nature and has historically increased throughout a variety of cyclical periods.

108


-----

Demand within the pharmaceutical market is driven by widespread global demand for improved
healthcare standards, rising disease awareness and consistent investment in scientific innovation and
subsequent introduction of new products and treatment regimes.

**_Aging World Population_**

Older individuals have a wider variety and consistency of health care needs and generally consume a
greater proportion of healthcare spend and pharmaceutical products than younger people, particularly for
the treatment of chronic diseases. According to the United Nations, the median age in the world is
projected to rise from approximately 30 years in 2015 to approximately 36 years by 2050, with the median
age in Europe projected to rise from approximately 42 years in 2015 to approximately 47 years by 2050.
Furthermore, the percentage of the population aged 50 years and older is projected to increase by 5.0%
from 2015 to 2030.

**Aging population in Europe (% of population 50+ years-old)**

27APR202021560170

**_Innovation Addressing Previously Unmet Medical Needs and Enhanced Treatment Options for Existing_**
**_Patients_**

New medicines are expected to transform patient care in connection with a large number of diseases,
including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as oncology, immunology and central nervous
system disorders, requiring increasing amounts of R&D expenditures. According to the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, the pharmaceutical industry invested more than
A33.9 billion in R&D in Europe in 2016, compared to R&D expenditures of A7.8 billion in 1990,
representing an increase of over four times.

**_Pharmaceutical Products Provide Cost-effective Healthcare Spend Alternatives_**

Compared to other healthcare measures such as hospitalization and surgery, pharmaceutical products
contribute a relatively small share to total healthcare spending and thus are a cost-effective measure for
healthcare payors for the management of diseases.

**_Pharmaceutical Cost-containment in Developed Markets_**

Government austerity measures, especially in the Eurozone, are resulting in the tightening of
reimbursement policies and increasing pressure on the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for
their products. Furthermore, reductions in overall health care spending by governments has led to an
increased focus on cost-effective alternatives, including generic prescription products and preventive
medicine through more frequent consumption of OTC products.

**_Lifestyle Changes_**

In the developed markets, an increase in the consumption of unhealthy foods combined with a general
trend towards a more sedentary lifestyle has led to an increase in ailments such as diabetes, heart disease,
high cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity. This has led to an increased demand for pharmaceutical
products designed to treat and prevent these conditions and an increase in demand for nutraceutical
products and vitamins. Notably, this trend is also becoming increasingly apparent in emerging markets.

Health Insurance and Increase in Disposable Income

The significant growth in disposable household income in both developed and emerging markets and the
expansion of health insurance coverage is expected to drive increased access and demand for both
prescription pharmaceuticals and OTC products. This has led for example, to an increased demand for
cough, cold and allergy products.

**_Increasing Role of Emerging Markets_**

According to IQVIA, emerging markets are expected to account for a large portion of overall growth in
the pharmaceutical industry in the coming years. For example, in the generics industry, Central Eastern
European countries such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Serbia are
expected to grow at a combined CAGR of 3.2% for 2018 to 2022, while Russia and Ukraine are expected
to grow at a CAGR of approximately 8% and 11%, respectively, for the same period. This is higher than
the anticipated growth of developed Western European countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland where the combined generics industry CAGR for 2020
to 2024 is expected to be 5.1% (source: IQVIA). Overall economic activity in emerging markets is expected
to grow in line with rising disposable incomes, rising life expectancy and increased access to medical care.
Compared to more mature markets, emerging markets tend to have a larger proportion of branded
generics products and have health care systems that promote higher levels of ‘‘out of pocket’’ spending by
the consumer.

**Industry Structure**

The broader global pharmaceutical industry can be grouped into five categories, each addressing different
market segments as described below:

**_Integrated, Global Pharmaceutical Companies_**

These are typically global pharmaceutical companies that are involved in all aspects of the pharmaceutical
value chain from early stage compound discovery, research and development to the sale and marketing of
the pharmaceutical product. The high failure rates and costs associated with discovering and developing a
compound in the laboratory through to successful commercialization leads most global pharmaceutical

110


27APR202021561079


-----

companies to focus their efforts on the development and commercialization of a limited number of
blockbuster drugs in their portfolio so as to achieve an acceptable level of profitability.

**_Specialty Pharmaceutical Companies_**

These are typically small to medium sized pharmaceutical companies focused either on specific
geographies or therapeutic areas. Geographic focused pharmaceutical companies focus primarily on the
marketing and distribution of drugs within selected regions where they have developed a strong sales force
presence. These companies often have broad product portfolios and strong national or regional
distribution networks. Therefore, geographic focused pharmaceutical companies tend to be less at risk
from the failure of any single product or any single market and, unlike global pharmaceutical companies,
focus their efforts on small and medium value drugs. Specialty drug focused therapeutic pharmaceutical
companies instead focus on specific therapeutic areas across the value chain. These companies typically
seek to have a multi-national presence in their particular niche product markets.

**_Biotechnology Companies_**

Biotechnology companies focus on new drug discoveries based on biological processes and are generally
engaged in the early stages of the value chain. These companies rely on their technological expertise, and
only the larger companies have developed sales and marketing capabilities. Biotechnology companies often
seek to bring their products to market through partnerships and alliances with larger pharmaceutical
companies which have established sales and marketing functions. Biotechnology companies are growing in
importance as they are increasingly responsible for the discovery of new drugs.

**_Generic Pharmaceutical Companies_**

Generic pharmaceutical companies focus on the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products which
are no longer patent protected. These companies do not typically engage in the research and development
of new products and seek to maintain profitability by focusing on low-cost and high volume production.

**_Consumer Healthcare Companies_**

Consumer healthcare and OTC companies focus on the manufacture and sale of products that meet health
needs but do not require prescriptions. Despite varying definitions of consumer healthcare, it is generally
considered to be made up of any consumer good in which health related claims can be made including:
OTC medicines, personal hygiene, oral care, food & beverage, nutritional products, women’s health, infant
care products and nutraceuticals. These markets are characterized by significantly lower levels of
regulation and government involvement, generally not being reimbursable under government backed
healthcare schemes. The consumer healthcare market and companies are very focused on brands, with a
correlation between profitability and the contribution of leading brands to companies’ portfolios both
globally and locally. OTC drugs account for the largest portion of the consumer healthcare market,
followed closely by vitamins and dietary supplements.

**Regulation**

The global pharmaceutical industry is extensively regulated by a number of local and international
regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine
Agency. Regulatory requirements and procedures can differ by individual pharmaceutical market, but
include provisions relating to the control of the pharmaceutical markets, manufacturing, research and
clinical development, marketing, labelling and packaging, storage, distribution, dispensing, advertising and
promotion, export and import, and sometimes pricing of pharmaceutical products.

**_European Union_**

The EU pharmaceutical industry regulations require that medicinal products, including generic versions of
previously approved products and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved
products, must receive a marketing authorization before they can be placed on the market in the EU.
There are three main procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in
the EU member states: the Centralized Procedure, the Mutual Recognition Procedure, and the
Decentralized Procedure (each as described herein). It is also possible to obtain a pure national
authorization for products intended for commercialization in a single EU member state only. For more
information, see ‘‘Regulation.’’

111


-----

**Pricing and Reimbursement**

Healthcare is a major focus of governments around the world, with health services consuming a significant
percentage of governments’ budgets. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of
reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs, managed
care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Pharmaceutical prices in developed nations
are predominantly determined by government controlled authorities.

**_Europe_**

The majority of European citizens obtain their healthcare benefits from state organized programs.
Governments in European nations exert significant control over the cost of care, either through price
controls on prescription drugs, or reimbursement policies for prescription drugs sold within the country.
The following is an overview of the systems in the EU5 countries.

**_Germany_**

In 2009, it became compulsory for high net worth individuals who could opt out of statutory health
insurance to obtain private health insurance. In 2016, around 86-87% of the population was covered by
statutory health insurance with around 11% of the population covered by private health insurance.
Statutory health insurance is provided by statutory healthcare funds (Krankenkassen). Through these
funds, citizens have equal access to healthcare benefits from healthcare professionals who are licensed and
provide healthcare services within the statutory healthcare system. For the employed, membership in the
statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless their income rises above an annually determined
threshold (currently A57,600 per year). Previously, Germany did not apply any form of external price
referencing with other countries, and was itself a reference country for many EU member states. Under
the Pharmaceuticals Market Reorganization Act, a revised reimbursement system introduced in 2014
within the German statutory health insurance, drugs employing new active pharmaceutical ingredients are
allowed to set their prices for the first twelve months post launch. A cost benefit analysis is then launched
within three months of introduction by the Institute for Quality and Efficacy in Health Care. For all drugs
employing new active pharmaceutical ingredients, the manufacturer must prove the benefits over
comparable available products, failing which the drug will be added to the existing reference pricing list. At
the end of twelve months, the price of drugs that demonstrate additional benefits can be negotiated
between drug manufacturers and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds.

**_United Kingdom_**

The UK’s National Health Service (the ‘‘UK NHS’’) was established in 1948 to provide universal
healthcare to all residents. The UK NHS is financed partly by the government and partly from national
insurance premiums, paid at source by employers and employees. Around 11% of the population currently
has some form of private medical insurance. Reimbursements are subject to the Pharmaceutical Price
Regulation Scheme (‘‘PPRS’’), which is a profit framework that allows drug manufacturers a defined
return on capital and profit each year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (‘‘NICE’’)
was established in 1999 to review the cost efficiencies of medicines and discourage their use if their cost
outweighed their benefit. NICE is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of
Health in the United Kingdom.

In April 2017, the Health Services Medical Supplies (Costs) Act (‘‘The Act’’) was given Royal assent,
effective from April 2018. The Act is focused on controlling the cost of health service medicines and other
medical suppliers in the United Kingdom. Prices of branded medicines for the NHS are regulated through
two schemes: Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), which is voluntary, and Statutory Scheme.
Branded medicine providers can choose to sign up to PPRS or if not, they will automatically fall under the
control of Statutory Scheme. However, unbranded generic medicines sold by companies which had opted
into the PPRS in relation to their branded medicines, fell outside the Statutory Scheme. Hence pricing of
their unbranded generic medicines was not subject to the control of the Statutory Scheme and was instead
driven by market competition. This had created a loophole allowing some companies to significantly
increase the price of unbranded generics or in some cases de brand the branded medicine and significantly
increase the price owing to lack of competition. The Act introduced a similar payment mechanism on
medicines under the Statutory Scheme as that under the PPRS. As a result, the government can now
control the prices of unbranded generic medicines. In addition, the Act clarifies the government’s power to
require companies to make payments to control the cost of health service medicines. The Act also includes

112


-----

the power to create regulations requiring manufacturers, distributors and suppliers to the NHS to maintain
records and, if requested, disclose such records to the department of health through the issuance of an
information notice, thereby strengthening the basis on which the government can collect data on the sale
and purchase of medicines from all parts of the supply chain. In case of non-compliance, the government
can charge organizations a maximum penalty of £10,000 per day or a single payment of £100,000.

**_France_**

France has a social insurance system which provides near universal coverage for patients. The main scheme
(R´egime General) currently provides coverage for close to 92% of the population, and is predominantly
financed through compulsory contributions made by employees and employers. Around 95% of the
population has additional contracts with one of the supplementary sickness funds (including _mutuelles,_
which are not for profit providers) which cover private medical insurance and out of pocket payments. In
an effort to contain overall healthcare costs, the government closely controls the supply of prescription
drugs in its capacity as both regulator and the industry’s largest customer.

**_Spain_**

In Spain the government’s pricing and reimbursement policy has been focused on cost-containment
measures as it attempts to reduce its financial deficit, despite the fact that prices in Spain are among the
lowest in the European Union. Since 2000, the government has introduced various price cuts, reductions to
wholesale and retail margins and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs. At a central level, the Spanish
government has enacted four royal decree-laws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical
industry by means of price reduction of older pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs and
medical devices, and limitations of the numbers of products eligible for a reimbursement under the
Spanish National Health Service.

**_Italy_**

In Italy the price setting of medicines reimbursed by the National Health Service (the ‘‘Italian NHS’’) is
regulated at the central level by the Italian Medicines Agency (‘‘AIFA’’), the national regulatory authority.
The Italian health care system is mostly public and, therefore, the price of drugs is determined under strict
Health Technology Assessment processes. The prices of pharmaceuticals’ reimbursements by the Italian
NHS is set through direct negotiation between AIFA and the pharmaceutical companies. The Italian NHS
is largely funded through national and regional taxes, supplemented by co-payments from patients for
pharmaceuticals and outpatient care. Public sources make up approximately [4]⁄5 of total health care
spending, with private spending accounting for approximately 1/5, mainly in the form of out of pocket
expenses. In Italy, only small fraction of total health care expenditure is funded by private health insurance.

**European Generics Market**

In 2017, the generic drugs market in Europe had A31 billion in net sales. The major markets in Europe,
being Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, are expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately of 5.1% for 2020 to 2024. The graph below illustrates the European generic drug sales by
region for 2017.

**Industry Dynamics**

**_Generics Penetration_**

The size of the generics market differs widely across the various EU member states driven by various
factors including market conditions for new medicines, pricing/reimbursement structures, prescribing/
dispensing tradition and the prevalence of efforts to encourage generic use. In some member states such as
the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark, generics are promoted and seen as a tool
to contain rising pharmaceutical patent and trademark office costs and as such these member states have
strong generics penetration rates as follows (by value): United Kingdom 52.4%, Germany 56.3%, The
Netherlands 49.0% and Denmark 49.9%. In other markets such as Spain, Belgium and Italy, where the
original pharmaceutical prices are relatively low, brand-recognition is high and generics are not actively
prescribed by doctors or promoted by healthcare insurance companies, there is a much lower level of
generics market penetration. Hence, the penetration rates are as follows (by value): Spain 44.8%, Belgium
35.1% and Italy 38.1% (source: IQVIA MIDAS 2017).

There is an increasing policy shift in certain European countries to promote generic prescribing as part of
overall healthcare reforms and to reduce the overall level of pharmaceutical expenditure which will likely
lead to an increase in the level of generics penetration in European markets.

**_Patent Expiry of Top Selling Drugs_**

The pharmaceutical market is expected to face a large number of patent expirations in the coming years,
offering generic pharmaceutical companies opportunities to capitalize on this market. Furthermore, the
value of the addressable market for generics from key brands losing exclusivity has increased in the
majority of major European countries over the last three years (source: IQVIA MIDAS).

**_Cost-containment Measures_**

As noted above, many European countries are tightening reimbursement policies and increasing pressure
on the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for their products leading to an increased focus on
cost-effective alternatives such as generics and OTC drugs.

**_Increasing Demand in Emerging Markets_**

Emerging markets are expected to generate higher growth in generics and OTC markets than Western
Europe for the period from 2018 to 2022, with an expected CAGR for Russia and Romania over this
period of 4.9% and 11.2% respectively (source: IQVIA). This growth is driven by rising disposable
incomes, rising life expectancy and increased access to medical care. Despite having a larger proportion of
branded generic and OTC products than more mature markets, governments in emerging markets are
beginning to encourage the use of more cost-effective alternatives offered in generic drugs.

**Summary Overview of the Six Largest Geographic Markets for STADA**

**_Germany_**

The German generics market had sales of approximately A6.8 billion in 2017 and has one of the highest
levels of generic penetration of nearly 77% in 2017 (by volume). Germany has adopted key price saving
measures and a high price discount for generics, by a combination of reference pricing rebates, mandatory
substitution, reimbursement shifts, and a well-established public tendering system which covers the
majority of generic sales. The generics market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players in
Germany representing approximately 52% of the overall generics market. The German generics market
showed growth of 4.1% in 2014 to 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.6% in 2018 to 2022
(source: IQVIA).

OTC products represent an important product category in Germany representing approximately 35% of
overall market revenues where brand-recognition is important to consumers. The OTC market in Germany
had sales of approximately A4.6 billion (approximately $5.6 billion) in 2017 and is expected to grow at a
CAGR of 2.4% in 2018 to 2022, based on data received from IQVIA. OTC products are not reimbursed by
public health insurances but are paid for directly by the customers who continue to be influenced by brandrecognition. In Germany, OTC products are available in pharmacies, supermarkets and via online retailing.
The OTC market is highly fragmented with the top-ten companies representing approximately 39% of the
market in 2017, based on data received from IQVIA.

**_Russia_**

The Russian market had sales of approximately A2.8 billion for 2017 and has a relatively high level of
generic penetration of approximately 73% as of 2017 (by volume).

The government funded segment covering hospitals and the Additional Medicines Supply Program (the
‘‘DLO’’), which represents approximately 31% of the market, with purchasing largely conducted by tenders
with the government looking for the lowest price, and with a strong preference for local producers. The
majority of the market (approximately 66%) is driven by retail sales (largely via pharmacies) which is an
out of pocket market paid for directly by patients and consumers. Branded generics and OTC products
dominate the out of pocket market with INNs representing a very small share of the market. The state
funded segment is expected to lag behind retail due to the expected freeze of budget growth and
localization effects, with the retail sector expected to continue to drive the majority of the overall market
growth with the consumer health market growing faster than the prescription market.

The Russian generics market is one of the most fragmented markets in Europe with the top-five players by
sales controlling approximately 17% of the market in 2014. The Russian market grew at a CAGR of 15.1%
between 2013 and 2016, and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% in 2018 to 2022.

The OTC market in Russia has sales of approximately A4.3 billion (approximately $5.2 billion) in 2017 and
is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% in 2018 to 2022, based on data received from IQVIA—faster than
the majority of Western European countries despite the recent trends in reduced disposable income. The
majority of OTC products are non-reimbursable with OTC almost fully covered from out of pocket spend
by consumers. Currently, OTC products are only available in pharmacies with no other mass market
channels such as grocery stores or supermarkets and as such physician and pharmacist recommendations
are key sales drivers for OTC products.

The Russian OTC market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players in the Russian OTC market
representing approximately 22.3% of the market in 2017 (source: IQVIA OTC Review 2018 Russia).

**_Italy_**

The Italian generics market had sales of approximately A3.5 billion for 2017 and has one of the lowest
levels of generic penetration in Europe of approximately 48% as of 2017 (by volume) and an average level
of pricing discount as a result of a high level of brand awareness and use of branded generics.

In Italy, a mandatory 50% price discount is applied to public providers of generic pharmaceuticals
approved under national registration procedures, with wholesalers of generic pharmaceuticals restricted to
a regulated margin of 3% for wholesalers of generic pharmaceuticals. Tenders are only used for
procurement for public institutions such as hospitals. Physicians are free to indicate a specific brand of
pharmaceutical to avoid generic substitution if they explicitly give reasons for the choice, but pharmacies
are required to dispense a cheaper generic instead of a branded drug if not ruled out by a physician and if
available. Patients can also opt to co pay for a reimbursed pharmaceutical if the price being charged for the
branded product is above the reference price.

The Italian generics market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players by sales controlling
approximately 40.5% of the market in 2017. Given the high level of brand awareness, the pharmacist and
patient have the most influence on the purchasing decision. The Italian generics market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of 6.2% in 2018 to 2022 (source: IQVIA).

The Italian OTC market represented sales of approximately A3.5 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at
a CAGR of 2.3% in 2018 to 2022. The Italian market is generally flat in terms of volume growth while the
limited growth in terms of value is substantially determined by price increases. In addition, the market is
concentrated in a limited number of players. Tenders are only used for procurement for public institutions
such as hospitals. Physicians prescribing an off patent drugs are required to specify the active ingredient
and in addition they can add the name of the brand or the INN. Pharmacists are required to dispense the
cheapest product according to the ‘‘Transparency List,’’ unless patients choose to co pay in order to obtain
a more expensive brand.

**_United Kingdom_**

The UK generics market had sales of approximately A5.3 billion in 2017 and has one of the highest levels of
generic penetration in Europe of approximately 85% in 2017 (by volume).

The PPRS does not apply to generic versions of a pharmaceutical, which relies on competitive pricing
dynamics and allows free pricing for generic pharmaceuticals as long as the price is below that of the
patented original drug. Reimbursement is regulated at the retail level for Category M generics products
(approximately 90% of generics products) based on a calculation that incorporates the volume weighted
average price charged by manufacturers.

The UK is a mature and highly genericized market with the highest overall level of price discounting in
Europe as a result of the concentrated buying power of the NHS, although there is a limited use of tenders
in the UK market outside of hospitals and government tenders on vaccines for national immunization
schedules. Wholesalers are the key decision makers in the purchasing decision as both physicians and
pharmacists prescribe and order only by the generic name.

The UK generics market is highly fragmented with the top-five players by sales controlling approximately
13.7% of the market in 2017. The UK generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.6% in 2017 to
2022.

The OTC market in the United Kingdom represented sales of approximately A1.2 billion in 2017 and is
expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.6% in 2018 to 2022. The majority of OTC products are non-reimbursable
and there is a low level of regulation in the UK market, particularly as the UK is a pioneer of switching
established and well known prescription products to OTC. The nature to self-medicate is extremely
prevalent in the UK, with product choice heavily influenced by a high level of in store promotion and
direct to consumer advertising. Grocery retail stores, supermarkets and pharmacies remain the major
channels for the distribution of OTC products in the United Kingdom with online retailing growing slowly.
The UK OTC market is relatively consolidated with the top-five players representing approximately 37.3%
of the market (source: IQVIA OTC Review 2018 UK).

**_Spain_**

The Spanish generics market had sales of approximately A3.2 billion for 2017 and has a relatively low level
of generic penetration of approximately 60% as of 2017 (by volume).

Prices and margins for prescription drugs are tightly regulated. Recent pricing reform implemented in
Spain expects all pharmaceutical prices (including both original drug and generics drugs) to equalize, with
the government unlikely to reimburse products that do not reduce the list prices compared to the generics.
While price is the most important factor in the Spanish generics market, pharmacists still have a relatively
strong decision making power as a result of the fragmented pharmacy landscape in the country.

Pharmaceutical margins on generics are tightly regulated for both pharmacies and wholesalers, although
there is a limited use of tenders in the Spanish market except for certain regions (e.g. Andalusia) with
pharmaceutical companies typically contracting centrally with the regional authorities.

The Spanish generics market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players by sales controlling
approximately 38% of the market in 2014. The Spanish market grew at a CAGR of 5.4% between 2014 and
2017, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% in 2018 to 2022 (source: IQVIA).

In Spain, OTC products account for a relatively small proportion of the overall market compared to
prescription pharmaceuticals and generics, with total OTC revenues of approximately A1.5 billion in 2017
and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% from 2018 through 2022.

**_Belgium_**

The Belgian generics market had sales of approximately A613 million in 2017 and grew at a CAGR of 5.1%
between 2014 and 2017, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.4% in 2018 to 2022. The generic
penetration in Belgium is relatively low at 40% as of 2017 (by volume).

Since 2001, Belgium has a reference pricing system (‘‘RPS’’) for generics. The RPS works by imposing a
fixed minimum price difference between generic and originator medicines (reference price, RP). Over
time, the Belgian government has progressively reduced the reference price from 84% (until July 2002),
80% (until January 2003) to 74% of the price of the originator medicine (until July 2005). The current
level stands at minimum approximately 60% of the price of the originator medicine. After its introduction
in 2001, the RPS was associated with an increased market share of generic medicines. The RPS was
enlarged in 2005 to include all pharmaceutical forms and dosages of the same active substance. Patient
co-payments in Belgium are high compared to other European countries, and range from 0% to 80% of
the medicine price depending on the type of patient and medicine. Belgian policy attempts to foster
demand for generic medicines by increasing patient co-payment for specific medication classes and for
branded medicines that are off patent.

In 2006, quotas for prescribing low-cost medicines (generic medicines or originator medicines that have
reduced their price) were assigned to physicians. The volume quotas, expressed in defined daily doses
(DDD), affect reimbursable outpatient medicines dispensed by retail pharmacies, but not pharmacists’
magistral preparations. For the physicians, the minimum prescribing rate for lower priced medicines is
27% of all prescriptions expressed in DDD. Pharmanet (an information system created in 1996) data are
used to check whether physicians comply with quotas. If physicians prescribe expensive medicines
inappropriately, they are monitored by the Ministry of Health for at least six months and receive
information and training in low-cost prescribing.

A law permitting generic substitution by pharmacists conditional on getting approval from the prescribing
physician and the patient was passed in 1993. However, as the royal decree necessary to put this legislation
into practice has not been passed to date, generic substitution by pharmacists is not allowed. Since April
2010, pharmacist margins in Belgium are made up of two components: a fixed lump sum and an economic
margin set as a percentage of the price of the medicine (4%). This system aims to make the delivery of
generic medicines neutral to pharmacists from a financial perspective.

The OTC market in Belgium represented sales of approximately A742 million in 2017 and is expected to
grow at a CAGR of 1.8% between 2018 and 2022.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on branded and
unbranded generics, with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 30,000 SKUs
covering a large number of therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product
portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries
and have a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA
region, Asia, South America and Australia.

We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales and we ranked ninth among OTC companies in Europe
as of December 31, 2019. Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is
bolstered by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local
market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective
manufacturing footprint comprising 21 facilities across Europe, Asia and South America. Building on our
tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each year since 2014.
Our solid pipeline of new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a
strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our
business and further improve our profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, we generated sales of A2,608.6 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of
A885.3 million.

The products we sell are classified according to two divisions: Generics and Branded Products.

_Generics:_ Within our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics products, offering a lower-cost
alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical originator products. Most of the products in
our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only available from pharmacies and
hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by regulated pricing, with
competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations of originator
drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division, allowing us to leverage our distribution channels
and local market knowledge to launch new generics products. The product portfolio in our Generics
division is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 18% of sales in our Generics division
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling products (and their respective therapeutic
areas) in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Epoetin zeta (anemia),
Tilidine, Tilidine/Naloxone (pain), Atorvastatin (cholesterol), Omeprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux),
Pantoprazole (gastric ulcers/reflux), Diclofenac (pain, anti-inflammatory), Paracetamol (pain), Bisoprolol
(high blood-pressure), Amoxi-Clavulan (antibiotic), Fentanyl (analgesic). The largest countries by sales in
our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia,
Russia, France and Switzerland. We generated sales of A1,534.7 million and Management Adjusted
EBITDA of A439.3 million in our Generics division for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Branded Products:_ Our Branded Products division primarily includes branded OTC products, which are
typically available without a prescription, such as sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, DNA tests,
cosmetics, glucose meters and a small range of branded prescription generics. Our best-known brands
include Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad and Covonia (cough and cold) and APO-go (Parkinson’s disease).
The market for products in our Branded Products division is generally characterized by market-driven
pricing, with brand strength, marketing strategy and customer loyalty being important factors for success.
Our portfolio of Branded Products is diversified, with the top-ten products accounting for only 37% of
sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019. The top-ten selling brands
(and their respective therapeutic areas, prescription requirements and markets in which they are sold) in
our Branded Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019, were: Bortezomib (anti-cancer
medication, prescription required multiple myeloma), APO-go (Parkinson’s disease, prescription required,
available in 28 countries), Grippostad (colds, OTC, available in 28 countries), Zoflora (household
disinfection), Snup (rhinitis), Aqualor (rhinitis, sore throats, available in 18 countries), Nizoral
(anti-dandruff shampoo), Hirudoid (anti-coagulant), Vitaprost (prostate diseases) and Versatis (local
anesthetic). The largest countries by sales in our Branded Products division for the year ended
December 31, 2019, were: Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and Italy. We
generated sales of A1,073.9 million and Management Adjusted EBITDA of A298.0 million in our Branded
Products division for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Our Strengths**

**_Organic Growth Underpinned by Attractive Market Fundamentals and Bolt-on Acquisitions_**

Increasing demand for our Generics and Branded Products is driven by global growth factors in the
pharmaceutical industry, including population growth, aging societies, increased incidences of chronic
disease, advances in medical therapies and increasing self-medication and health awareness. According to
IQVIA, the global generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2020 to 2024, driven by
these growth trends and increasing generics penetration. Generics penetration in the market for
prescription products is partly driven by cost containment regulation that incentivizes the use of generics to
counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government-sponsored health programs. Another key driver
of generics penetration is patent expirations. According to publicly available estimates, a wave of patent
expirations in developed markets is expected to push originator products with sales of more than
$12.2 billion in aggregate into the generics market between 2019 and the end of 2022.

Given that our Branded Products division consists mostly of OTC products, growth in this division is
additionally driven by factors influencing the self-payment and self-care market for health and well-being
related products. We expect demand for self-payment and self-care products to benefit from the ongoing
trend among regulators to transfer prescription drugs to OTC status, which decreases the cost burden on
the public health system and expands market opportunity for companies such as us that offer branded
OTC products. Additionally, demand for OTC products is expected to be driven by rising income levels
and the emerging trend toward greater health awareness, which we believe results from ongoing research
on disease prevention, data access and increasing levels of education. According to IQVIA, the global
OTC market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% from 2020 to 2024.

In addition to our organic growth, we have a strong record of growth through focused acquisitions. In 2019,
we acquired from GlaxoSmithKline five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, as well
as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and expanded our footprint in Eastern Europe and Asia
through our acquisitions of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in
Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals
in the Philippines, to bolster our presence in Asia following the disposal of our Vietnamese joint venture.
Furthermore, we agreed to acquire the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG, a specialist in the
trade and distribution of pharmaceutical products in Switzerland, to expand our Swiss operations. Most
recently, we acquired multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the
Takeda Acquisition and a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe through the
Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from
GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands.

**_Well-Established Generics Player with Leading Positions in Our Generics Division and an Attractive Portfolio_**
**_in Our Branded Products Division with High Growth Potential Through Enhanced Internationalization_**

We are the fifth-largest generics company by sales in Europe as of December 31, 2019. In our Generics
division, based on IQVIA data for the year ended December 31, 2019, we held a top-three market share in
generics sales in Germany. We were also the fourth-largest player in Italy and the fourth-largest in Spain.
Moreover, in the year ended December 31, 2019, our Belgian Generics unit was the leader in the Belgian
market, and we ranked second among national manufacturers in the Russian Generics market. Even
though these markets are generally considered to be mature, there is significant room for increased
penetration (by value) and further growth in generics in these markets. For example, according to IQVIA,
generics penetration by sales value is below 30% in Belgium, 35% in Italy, 35% in Spain, and below 50% in
France and 45% in Germany. The generics industry in Germany, Spain and Russia is expected to increase
by a CAGR of 5.4%, 7.9% and 9.2% from 2020 to 2024, respectively. Continued growth in the generics
industry in countries where we are already market leaders provides us with an opportunity to continue to
grow sales in our Generics division.

We also benefit from an attractive portfolio of products in our Branded Products division, including
category-leading therapies for cough and cold, medical skin care sun protection, vitamin deficiencies and
many leading brands across therapeutic areas in Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and other
countries. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 75% of sales of our top 30 products in
our Branded Products division were of products with a top-three market position in their respective
countries. Many of these leading products have been category leaders in their respective markets for many
years, providing us with an opportunity to leverage our local marketing expertise to drive the

internationalization of these leading brands into new markets and further grow sales in our Branded
Products division.

**_Competitive Advantage Through Scale, Local Market Expertise and Established Relationships_**

Our market-leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage over new entrants in our markets,
bolstered by our scale and the breadth of our product portfolio, as well as our local market expertise and
established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and pharmacies.

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated
in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a
new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement
regimes and distribution channels. This provides an advantage to existing, large-scale players with a long
history of local expertise, such as us. We are highly familiar with the regulatory requirements in our key
markets and have developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory and distribution issues, which
enables us to minimize the time and cost required to obtain regulatory product approvals while maximizing
the number of countries we cover.

Germany, for example, operates a public tender system that covers the majority of prescription generics
sales, which necessitates a modestly sized sales team with significant tender experience. In Russia, on the
other hand, the distribution of prescription generics products is mostly patient-driven after the first
prescription, which significantly increases the need for a larger sales force targeting patients indirectly via
doctors. Our local market experience means that we are adept at navigating these and other regimes and
are able to serve each market with a tailored sales and distribution approach. Building on our long history
and our origins as a pharmacy cooperative, we have developed deeply ingrained relationships with the key
distribution channels in our markets, which we believe are difficult to replicate. We successfully pursue
different business models tailored to local markets’ needs. Our sales forces are trained and experienced in
identifying the right marketing strategy for each country, and we maintain a direct sales presence in
approximately 30 countries, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors and
internationalize successful brands.

**_Diversified Across Geographic Areas, Therapeutic Areas, Products and Brands_**

We are diversified across geographic markets, products, therapeutic areas, customers and suppliers,
thereby limiting our exposure to any single product, geographic area and reimbursement system. We
market our products in approximately 120 countries with largely uncorrelated end-markets.

With more than 30,000 SKUs, we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and are not dependent on the
success of any single product. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the top-ten products by sales in our
Generics division accounted for only 18% of Generics sales, and the top-ten products in the Branded
Products division accounted for only 37% of Branded Products sales. Our product offering is diversified
across a large number of therapeutic areas and benefits from a high rate of new product launches, with a
strong pipeline for the next four to five years.

The combination of our Generics and Branded Products divisions provides us with significant benefits in
terms of diversification and synergies. The pricing of prescription generics is regulated, and volume
demand is relatively independent of economic conditions, such that our Generics business has historically
delivered strong and stable sales and cash generation. Our Branded Products division, on the other hand,
faces fewer regulatory requirements. OTC products can be brought to the market more quickly, and
pricing is unregulated and driven by competition. As a result, our highly recognizable brands, customer
loyalty and the lack of competition in certain specialty areas provide for attractive pricing for products in
our Branded Products division. Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond
relatively quickly to emerging consumer trends. Our presence in both divisions allows us to deepen our
local market expertise and regulatory know-how; exploit economies of scale in production, packaging and
marketing; and maintain our long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.

**_Diversified and Efficient Manufacturing Footprint Across the Globe_**

We have a cost-effective manufacturing footprint that is diversified across 21 manufacturing sites.
Furthermore, in 2019 approximately 71% of our production volume is manufactured in lower-cost
countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a relatively low-cost and
highly flexible production base.

120


-----

Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and 15 of our sites are
required to comply with stringent EU standards and are EU certified plants. Moreover, local production
helps provide a natural hedge for currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an
advantage in the marketing of products in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage
our costs in order to increase our margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to
further streamline and improve certain aspects of our manufacturing operations.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Cash Flow Generation Reinforced by Successful Improvements in_**
**_Working Capital Management_**

We have a stable underlying business that has delivered consistent sales growth and resulted in high cash
flow generation in recent years. Our constant-currency sales increased at a CAGR of 7.0% from
December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2019. We had Adjusted Cash Conversion of 85% and 81% for the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although our Management Adjusted EBITDA
margins have already improved (22% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively), we see significant additional upside in our ability to drive cost savings and further increase
our margins. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements. We
have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital movements, and management has
maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a manufacturer of generics, we
typically incur limited development expenses and no material research expenses.

**_Highly Experienced Management Team Supported by Committed Sponsors_**

We have a highly experienced management team led by Peter Goldschmidt, who has been the Chief
Executive Officer of STADA since September 2018 and draws on over 29 years of experience in the
pharmaceutical industry. Having held various senior management positions in Europe, Asia and the
United States for the Novartis Group, Mr. Goldschmidt also served as the President of Sandoz USA and
the Head of North America at Sandoz, where he rapidly expanded the company’s generics and biosimilar
business, generating revenues of over $3 billion. He was also the global executive member for Central and
Eastern Europe for Sandoz, leading Sandoz to a top ranking market position in generics and rapidly
growing its OTC business. On February 1, 2020, Wolfgang Ollig joined our senior management team as our
new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ollig has more than 15 years of experience as group chief financial officer
in various industries, including medical, automotive and biotech. Most recently, Mr. Ollig served as chief
financial officer of WSA A.S, a Danish company under private equity ownership that is the global leader in
hearing aid manufacturing, with more than 10,000 employees and headquarters in Copenhagen and
Singapore. Mr. Ollig has significant experience in capital markets transactions, having led automotive
supplier Hella as chief financial officer in its 2014 initial public offering. Our leadership team also includes
Miguel Pagan Fernandez who was appointed Chief Technological Officer of STADA on July 1, 2018,
having previously served as the Head of Global Technical Operations (Solids and Special Technologies) of
Novartis. In addition to our senior executive team, our business benefits from experienced and dedicated
operational teams with a deep understanding of the healthcare and generics markets. Our management
team has successfully grown our business to become the fifth-largest generics company in Europe and
increased our sales from A2,330.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, to A2,608.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 2019, through both organic growth and a number of strategic bolt-on
acquisitions.

Since the STADA Acquisition in August 2017, we also draw from the market expertise, business
relationships, knowledge and experience of our Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors
have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive and successful track record of investing in companies in
the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital increased sales by 49% within two years and significantly
increased the workforce at Bio Products Laboratory, creating a life sciences champion in the United
Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large laboratory diagnostics companies, Synlab (Germany) and
Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form Synlab Group (headquartered in Germany), the European
champion in laboratory diagnostics. In addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury Pharma and
Amdipharm, and merged the two businesses to create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented generics
market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy centered on continued buy and build, further
internationalization and applying best practice across both companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to
TSX/Nasdaq listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion in 2015. Most recently, Cinven has acquired
LGC, a global leader in the life sciences sector. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving
cost savings and improvements in margins, while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both

121


-----

organically and through targeted acquisitions. Our recent revenue and profitability growth was driven by
the Transformation Program that the Sponsors are implementing at STADA, which contributed to the
significant increase in our EBITDA margin from 19% in the year ended December 31, 2018, to 22% in the
year ended December 31, 2019.

**Our Strategy**

We and the Sponsors have developed the following strategies:

**_Maintain and Grow Market-Leading Positions by Leveraging Scale, Highly Recognizable Brands and Industry_**
**_Growth Factors_**

As an established market leader, we intend to continue to use our scale and highly recognizable brands to
reinforce and grow our leading market positions in the key countries and categories in which we operate.
We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from global growth factors in the pharmaceutical
industry, and as a large player highly diversified across geographic region, products, brands and
production, we intend to continue to leverage our scale and broad local expertise to support our base
business, improve our margins and expand our geographic footprints along with the markets in which we
operate.

**_Selectively Consider Accretive Acquisition Opportunities_**

We have a strong track record of growth, both organically and through focused acquisitions, and we intend
to continue this growth in the future, as evidenced by both the Takeda Acquisition and the Walmark
Acquisition which we estimate have a combined EBITDA multiple of 8.5x (based on an estimated
combined synergized EBITDA of A80.9 million).

Examples of our most recent acquisitions include our acquisition of five skincare brands and a pediatric
cough remedy in Europe and selected markets in APAC and Latin America from GlaxoSmithKline, our
acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine, our
acquisition of the Fern C Consumer Health Business, a small portfolio of pharmaceuticals in the
Philippines, our acquisition of the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland, our
acquisition or multiple, highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines through the Takeda
Acquisition our acquisition of a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe through
the Walmark Acquisition. Moreover, we recently agreed to acquire another pharmaceuticals portfolio from
GlaxoSmithKline, which consists of 15 well-established consumer healthcare brands.

We intend to continue to selectively explore strategic acquisitions in the global generics and OTC markets,
with a focus on targets and/or pharmaceutical assets that allow us to utilize our existing platform and
realize meaningful synergies.

**_Continue to Grow Our Business, Including by Internationalizing Successful Brands in Our Branded Products_**
**_Division_**

The products in our Generics division comprise our core business, providing us with a stable sales base and
strong cash generation. We see significant potential to expand sales growth in this division by expanding in
markets with relatively low penetration rates and supplementing our existing portfolio with biosimilars,
while also benefiting from global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry.

At the same time, we intend to build on our key brands and to grow our Branded Products division by
strengthening our market shares in our existing geographic region and introducing our local category
leaders into new, international markets. Our intention is to continue to gradually increase the percentage
of sales and EBITDA generated by our Branded Products division. In addition, we plan to continue
developing products for specialty areas, which tend to benefit from attractive pricing, to further expand the
scope and improve the profitability of our Branded Products division.

**_Increase Profitability by Continuing and Expanding upon Management’s Strategic Cost Savings Initiatives_**

In the last quarter of 2017, our management established a transformation program to improve our
operating efficiency and profitability (the ‘‘Transformation Program’’). The Transformation Program
targeted aggregate run-rate cost savings of more than A200 million by the end of 2021, which we aimed to
realize through a number of strategic cost saving initiatives. Having commenced the initial implementation
phase of the Transformation Program at the end of 2017, we had realized (i) approximately A52.0 million of

122


-----

cumulative cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (ii) approximately A108.8 million of
cumulative cost savings in the year ended December 31, 2019. We are continuing the rollout of our
Transformation Program and believe we are currently on track to realize additional incremental cost
savings of approximately A45.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2020, which would bring our
cumulative cost savings to A154.5 million. In addition, we expect cost savings of approximately A3.0 million
in IT, the majority of which we expect to realize within the next 18 months, resulting in incremental cost
savings of approximately A48.7 million. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements’’ and ‘‘—Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.’’_

In terms of cost of sales, management has put in place initiatives to improve direct product procurement by
renegotiating supply contracts with our highly fragmented supply base and to create operational
improvements in manufacturing through insourcing certain third-party manufactured products and
streamlining product lines, while also improving our supply chain setup and organization through hub,
route and order size optimization. For general and administrative expenses, we believe we can achieve cost
savings by unifying our IT landscape across our footprint through consolidating IT systems and contracts,
reducing non-personnel general and administrative spending, and optimizing advisory and supervisory
board costs, while also optimizing our sales force structures by streamlining our legal entities. In the year
ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately A32 million to implement the Transformation
Program and develop a five-year strategy for the implementation of future cost saving measures. Our
additional cost saving measures target our cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses,
and research and development expenses, as well as improved efficiency in support functions and customer
service operations.

**_Maintain Financial Discipline to Support Deleveraging_**

We intend to maintain a high focus on continuing to improve cash flows, supported by, among other things,
rapid EBITDA growth resulting from management’s and the Sponsors’ cost saving initiatives on top of
global growth trends in the pharmaceutical industry. For our business, which benefits from significant
operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in capital
expenditures broadly in line with historical capital expenditures. We expect improved cash flows and
discipline in capital expenditures to provide a strong liquidity cushion for our ongoing business needs,
which was further bolstered by our A400 million Revolving Credit Facility and the long dated maturity
profile of our other principal sources of debt financing. In terms of risk management, we are partly
naturally hedged for transaction currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the
same country as the end consumer, but we also intend to continue to implement exchange rate hedging
policies through natural hedge strategies and derivatives. As a result, we believe that the successful
execution of our strategies will allow us to progressively de lever and further improve cash flow generation.
Notwithstanding our intention to de lever and our focus on organic growth, we also intend to selectively
consider acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.

**Our History**

Our historical roots can be traced back to a pharmacist’s cooperative founded in 1895 in Dresden,
Germany, when a group of pharmacists started manufacturing pharmaceutical products under the name
Standardarzneimittel Deutscher Apotheker. Over the course of our over 120-year history we have

123


-----

leveraged our sustainable approach to business and a strategy geared for the long-term to expand from a
small pharmaceutical undertaking focused on its domestic German market, into a leading player in the
international healthcare and pharmaceutical markets:

- In 1957, we transferred our headquarters to its current location in Bad Vilbel.

- Shortly thereafter, in 1961, we started shifting our manufacturing activities from local production by
our member pharmacies to centralized production facilities in Bad Vilbel.

- At the beginning of 1970, we converted our corporate form from a cooperative into a corporation to
facilitate capital formation for our future expansion.

- In 1975, we expanded our product portfolio by venturing into the nascent generics market.

- In 1986, we leveraged our access to capital and began our expansion into international markets, first
through the purchase of subsidiaries in our neighboring countries, Switzerland and Austria, and later
through acquisitions in Asia, including Hong Kong in 1992.

- In 1996, we acquired ALIUD PHARMA GmbH in Germany, which allowed us to expand our generics
portfolio to a second, separate product line. In 1997, we branched out further into the Czech Republic
and France.

- In October 1997, we consummated our initial public offering (‘‘IPO’’) and listed our shares for official
trading on the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and D¨usseldorf. Within five years of our IPO, our shares
were included in the renowned MDAX segment of the Deutsche Boerse Group. Today, our shares are
listed on Xetra and the stock exchanges of Frankfurt, Berlin, D¨usseldorf, Hamburg, Hannover,
Munich and Stuttgart.

- By 2005, we had accelerated our international expansion and acquired companies in Thailand,
Ireland, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Russia, Portugal and Serbia. In addition, we purchased
several portfolios of Branded Products, as well as the rights to individual Branded Products.

- In 2006, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of A1 billion.

- In 2008, the introduction of SILAPO, a pharmaceutical product used to treat anemia resulting from
chronic kidney failure and chemotherapy, marked our first commercialization of a biosimilar. In the
following years, we began in-licensing biosimilars from highly specialized suppliers, in order to
develop our biosimilars portfolio in a cost-effective way.

- In 2013, we moved into the field of individualized drug therapy with the introduction of multiple DNA
tests, and thereby developed our diagnostic portfolio. Over the course of the year the offering was
expanded into a diverse range of self-tests. Furthermore, with the acquisition of the British OTC
supplier Thornton & Ross, we took another step in developing our increasingly important Branded
Products portfolio.

- In 2014, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of A2 billion.

- In 2017, the Sponsors, Bain and Cinven Funds, acquired a controlling interest in STADA with the aim
of consolidating its market-leading positions, further expanding its business and increasing
profitability.

- In 2018 and 2020, the Sponsors further increased their controlling interest through the Delisting Offer
and several negotiated transactions, respectively.

**Our Products**

**_Overview_**

_Generics and Branded Products_

We are a leading international healthcare and pharmaceuticals company which develops, manufactures
and markets branded and unbranded generics. Generics are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of
reference branded originator drugs and can be introduced into the market once the patents on the
originator drugs have expired. Despite their high quality, generics are substantially less expensive than the
originator products because the original research costs and clinical trials do not have to be repeated.

In our Generics division, we sell unbranded generics mostly comprising prescription products, thereby
offering a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more-expensive originator products. In most countries,

124


-----

the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly or indirectly through reimbursement rates
payable by the health insurance system. Unbranded generics are typically labeled with the name of their
manufacturer and marketed under the chemical name of their active pharmaceutical ingredient. The
chemical name is also referred to as the generic name or International Non-Proprietary Name (‘‘INN’’).
Examples of unbranded generics that we market under their chemical name include Tilidine Naloxone
(pain) and Atorvastatin (elevated cholesterol level).

Our range of Branded Products is diverse. It mainly includes branded generics that can be sold
over-the-counter, which are also referred to as branded OTC or nonprescription products. OTC products
can be purchased without the supervision of a healthcare professional such as a physician, and without a
prescription. These drugs are tried and tested products that have been on the market for many years and
are not typically protected by patents but rely on brands to differentiate the products. Examples include
sunscreens, cough and cold medicines, and pain relievers. Additionally, our Branded Products portfolio
features non-generic pharmaceutical products such as DNA tests, cosmetics, glucose meters and vaping
products. Lastly, our range of Branded Products comprises a small range of branded prescription generics.
Our best-known brands include Ladival (OTC), Grippostad (OTC), Covonia (OTC) and APO-go
(prescription only). Prices of Branded Products are much more flexible than those of Generics and can be
set on the basis of the competitive advantage a product has over its competitors.

_Categorization_

Whether products are categorized into the Generics or Branded Products division depends on our
marketing strategy. The marketing of prescription generics is generally price-driven, and where we decide
to compete mainly on that basis and market generics under their chemical name, we classify them into the
Generics division. In some cases, we assign generics to the Branded Products division because we are able
to compete on the basis of product quality, brand awareness and brand loyalty among customers, such that
we are able to charge premium prices.

In most countries, our portfolio of Branded Products predominantly comprises OTC products such as
Ladival (sunscreen), Grippostad (for coughs and colds) and Aqualor (for sinus infections and sore
throats). In the United Kingdom our range of Branded Products also includes major prescription products
such as APO-go (for Parkinson’s disease). Our OTC products and medical devices are globally assigned to
the Branded Products division.

_Delivery Forms and Packaging_

Our product portfolio comprises a broad range of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, suppositories, dry
powder for reconstitution as suspensions and liquids. We offer a large spectrum of packaging sizes and
various delivery forms, utilizing either immediate or sustained release delivery. We generally do not market
injectables.

_Diversification Across Therapeutic Areas_

Our pharmaceutical product offering is well diversified across therapeutic areas and focuses on the
following categories: allergies and hay fever; diagnostics; diabetes; coughs and colds; fitness and vitality;
sore throats; skin diseases; cardiovascular diseases; gastrointestinal conditions; muscle and joint
conditions; histamine intolerance; lactose intolerance; stress relief and sleep disorders; menstrual
dysfunction and the menopause; pain and fever relief; pregnancy and lactation; medical skincare sun
protection; and metabolic conditions.

_Diversification Across Products_

With more than 30,000 SKUs on offer, we carry a highly diversified product portfolio. The breadth of our
portfolio also ensures that we are not dependent on the success of any single product, with no single
product accounting for more than 3% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, the top-ten products by sales in our Generics division accounted for only 18% of
Generics sales, and the top-ten products in the Branded Products division accounted for only 37% of
Branded Products sales. Our product offering also benefits from a healthy rate of replenishment. We have
released on average 600 new products (primarily in our Generics division) per year since 2014, with a
strong pipeline for the next four to five years. See ‘‘—Research and Product Development.’’

125


-----

_Diversification Across Geographic Regions_

Our SKUs are marketed in approximately 120 largely uncorrelated markets in Europe, the MENA region,
Asia, Australia and the Americas, which provides us with a high degree of diversification across geographic
regions.

**_Our Generics Portfolio_**

_Overview_

In our Generics division, we sell a well-diversified portfolio of unbranded generics mostly comprising
prescription products. Generics accounted for A1,534.7 million, or 59%, of our sales in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Top-Ten Generics_

Our portfolio of Generics includes numerous market leaders in mature product categories.

_Competitive Drivers_

With prescription generics pricing regulated, the key determinants of success in most of our Generics
markets are price (particularly where contracts are put out to tender), as well as scale, a competitive cost
structure, local market expertise, established distribution channels, strong relationships with suppliers and
portfolio breadth.

We were the fifth-largest generics company in Europe as of December 31, 2019, and the resulting scale
advantage, together with our efficient manufacturing footprint across lower-cost countries, our extensive
local market expertise that we have acquired since our inception in 1895 and our deeply ingrained
relationships with suppliers that we have established over our long history all contribute to this leading
position in the Generics market. As a one-stop shop, we are also committed to providing a full portfolio in
most of our markets. This gives us a competitive advantage, as customers often request a multitude of
different dosage forms and strengths when placing orders for Generics, which we can reliably supply,
whereas many of our competitors do not have this capability and thus cannot fulfill these orders. The
breadth of our portfolio also helps us to achieve economies of scale in production, packaging and
marketing.

_In-licensed Products_

With respect to certain patented originator products and biosimilars we have entered into license
agreements with highly specialized, high profile suppliers under which distribution rights are licensed to us
on attractive commercial terms. Due to our local market expertise, established distribution channels and
geographic reach into approximately 120 countries, we are an in-licensing partner of choice.

In 2015, for the first time ever, the number of newly expired patents on biologics in Germany exceeded
newly expired patents on chemical synthetic products, which contributed to the significant increase in the
global generics market from 2014 to 2015. We believe that this is evidence of a trend toward the increasing
importance of biosimilars in the future global generics market, which is partly due to the fact that
biosimilars can be produced at significantly lower-cost than the original biologics. This means that these
products can substantially reduce the cost pressure faced by the global national healthcare markets and
insurance carriers. As a result, we are committed to the future growth of biosimilars and believe that
in-licensing constitutes a relatively low risk and cost-effective step towards developing our own biosimilars
portfolio.

We currently market two biosimilars: SILAPO, an epoetin biosimilar; and Movymia, a teriparatide
biosimilar. In addition, we have in-licensed three other biosimilars, including adalimumab (a biosimilar to
Humira), pegfilgrastim and bevacicumab. Furthermore, we have entered into an agreement with Xbrane, a
Swedish biosimilar company, for the co-development of ranibizumab and are exploring options to license
ranibizumab for distribution in North America. In addition, we have entered into a strategic partnership
with Alvotech, a biopharmaceutical company, giving us exclusive commercialization rights to seven
biosimilars in all major European markets and selected non-European markets, and we recently succeeded
in extending the scope of our exclusivity rights, which we believe further enhances our business
opportunity.

We intend to continue to grow our Generics portfolio through in-licensing and co-development strategies
aimed at the expansion of our biosimilars offering.

**_Our Branded Products Portfolio_**

_Overview_

Our well diversified portfolio of Branded Products includes, among others, pain relievers, cough and cold
medicine, sunscreens, cosmetics, rhinitis medicine, probiotics and dietary supplements, sleeping aids,
diagnostics, glucose meters, vaping products and branded prescription generics. Branded Products
accounted for A1,073.9 million, or 41%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Pain Relief_

One of the chief categories in our product portfolio is pain relief, and we carry products targeting general
pain, migraines, fever-induced pain, toothache, muscle pain, menstrual pain and others. We sell many
delivery forms including tablets, syrups, suspensions and suppositories. Some of our best-known brands
include Mobilat, Ibudolor, Neuranidal and Pfeil.

_Cough and Cold Medicines_

Our product range comprises a wide variety of cough and cold medicines, which can be administered as
effervescent tablets, syrups, sprays, gels and capsules. Our key brands in the category include Grippostad,
which ranks first in Germany; Covonia, which is one of the most recognizable brand names in the United
Kingdom; and Aqualor, with respect to Russia.

_Sunscreens_

We sell sunscreen products in various delivery forms, including creams, sprays, lip balms and sticks. Our
key brand in the medical skincare sun protection space is Ladival, which is the first-in-class product in
Germany in terms of brand recognition among pharmacists. We developed Ladival over 30 years ago and
in 2013 we transferred the European trademark rights to a third-party; we have since repurchased those
rights. Many of our competitors’ sunscreen products contain synthetic compounds derived from petroleum
and natural gas (petrochemicals) which are absorbed by the skin. Our sunscreen offering is differentiated
in that it is derived from largely natural sources and is free from artificial fragrances, coloring,
petrochemicals and parabens which are known to cause allergies in some cases. In compliance with this
positioning, we distribute our Ladival products exclusively through pharmacies.

_Cosmetics_

Under the Claire Fisher brand, which we acquired in 2014, we market age-control products, moisturizers,
exfoliators, creams, tonics, lotions, shower gels and liquid soaps. As in the case of our sunscreen products,
we mainly target health-conscious consumers who are drawn to mostly natural ingredients. Accordingly, we
developed our portfolio in close collaboration with dermatologists and other experts and took great care in
ensuring that all our cosmetics products are free from animal-derived ingredients, nanotechnology,
genetically modified plants, artificial colors, petrochemicals and parabens.

_Rhinitis Medicine_

Rhinitis medicine alleviates the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (commonly known as hay fever). Allergic
rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen such as pollen, dust, mold or flakes
of skin from certain animals. Our most recognizable brands include Aqualor, Snup, Cetirizin and
Loratadin.

_Probiotics and Dietary Supplements_

Our portfolio of Branded Products also includes probiotics and dietary supplements aimed at the
self-improvement market. Examples include vitamin supplements, lactose digestants, magnesium
supplements and immune system boosters.

128


-----

_Diagnostics_

In our diagnostics business, we market high-quality tests and testing devices both to healthcare
professionals and consumers. We believe this responds to an emerging trend, as consumers are becoming
increasingly health conscious and concerned with disease prevention. Our self-tests can be applied at home
and provide consumers with a quick and simple way to determine whether symptoms they experience may
be a first indication of a new or recurring illness. Our portfolio includes tests to detect colorectal cancer,
iron deficiency, gluten intolerance, bacterial infections and the menopause. Tests offered for professional
use include DNA tests to determine the efficacy of breast cancer therapies and the side effects of
anti-cholesterol therapies, as well as to tailor therapies for myocardial and stroke prophylaxis and
antidepressants to the individual requirements of each patient. In addition, we sell Ebola tests which
provide a quick and reliable check for this disease.

We also offer glucose meters and various accessories to enable diabetic patients to monitor and treat their
illness both at home and on the move.

_Branded Prescription Generics_

In certain cases, we assign prescription generics to the Branded Products business. This occurs mostly
where we can charge premium prices based on product quality, brand awareness and brand loyalty and
where there is a general lack of competition. One example is APO-go, which is a category leader in the
treatment of Parkinson’s disease in the United Kingdom.

_Top-Ten Branded Products_

Our broad and well diversified portfolio of Branded Products includes numerous mature-category leaders
in local markets, many of which have not yet been internationalized. We believe this provides us with
further potential to grow our sales organically. Approximately 75% of the sales generated by our top 30
Branded Products in 2019 were due to products ranking as one of the top-three in their respective
countries.

Set forth below are our top-ten Branded Products by sales in the year ended December 31, 2019, including
their respective market share and market position in selected markets for the year ended December 31,
2019 (except as otherwise indicated), on the basis of IQVIA and management data:

(1) Bortezomib was launched in April 2019. Accordingly, market position is shown as of and for the twelve months months ended
December 31, 2019.

_Portfolio Strategy_

In contrast to our Generics division, we generally pursue a selective portfolio approach in the Branded
Products division. As a result, we analyze each geographic market and only include those products in our
portfolio which we believe are in low supply despite strong demand. Using our judgment, we focus only on

129


-----

the most recognizable brands, which are well known to our end-customers and ideally the local market
leaders, and have growth opportunities largely independent of local market trends solely on the basis of
promotional and sales support.

**_Competitive Drivers_**

We believe the key drivers behind competition in the Branded Products space include brand recognition,
customer loyalty, established distribution channels and recommendations from pharmacists. We believe
that we are well positioned to compete in this market in light of our attractive portfolio of Branded
Products, which includes category leaders in mature markets.

**_Trends in Sales Mix_**

In recent years, the sales contribution from our Branded Products has remained stable at approximately
41% of total sales. The sales contribution of Branded Products in our sales mix is mainly the result of
organic growth, as well as our targeted efforts to increase sales in our Branded Products division through
acquisitions. Our acquisition of Thornton & Ross in the United Kingdom, for example, provided us with a
leading platform to sell our Branded Products in this market. We intend to continue to focus our growth
efforts on Branded Products, as they face significantly fewer regulatory requirements than Generics. To a
lesser extent, the shift was driven by the reclassification of certain Generics into Branded Products.

We believe the combination of Generics and Branded Products provides significant benefits in terms of
synergies. Our presence in both divisions allows us to deepen our local market expertise and regulatory
know-how, achieve economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing, and intensify our
long-standing relationships with our distribution channels.

**Our Customers**

We sell our products to a diverse customer base that includes consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals,
mail order companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as
well as public or private health insurance organizations. The importance of these customer groups varies by
country. Germany has a well-established tender scheme in place, such that the key purchase decision is
made by the public health insurance system. In our Belgian business, which mostly focuses on Generics, the
most important customer group is the doctors writing prescriptions. In Italy and Spain, pharmacies have
significant discretion to decide which medication is dispensed, such that they are considered the key
decision-makers. In Russia, where our product portfolio is heavily weighted toward Branded Products, our
key customers are consumers in the self-payment market. Germany’s public tendering system covers the
majority of generics sales, in which we have operated successfully. In Italy, the United Kingdom and
Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions such as hospitals. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, our largest customer accounted for A338.4 million, or 13%, of our sales. In the same
period, no other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales.

**Our Suppliers**

We believe that we do not materially depend on any single supplier. We seek to source our active
pharmaceutical ingredients locally in each of our markets. Most of our supply contracts include
mechanisms aimed at reducing our financial exposure, such as price escalation clauses (which link
procurement prices to current selling prices) and specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes.

**Procurement, Production and Quality Management**

We maintain three supply chain hubs at our locations in Bad Vilbel (Germany), Vrsac (Serbia) and
Moscow (Russia), which carry out the centralized procurement planning for our most important products.
In each hub we have a specialized supply chain management team, as well as the appropriate
infrastructure.

We generally have significant flexibility in our supply chain management and plan our pharmaceuticals
production with a view to continuous cost improvement. As a result of our large product portfolio, which
includes approximately 800 active pharmaceutical ingredients and more than 30,000 SKUs to
accommodate various dosage forms and package sizes, we rely on a large, international network of internal
and external resources for our supply chain and pharmaceuticals production.

130


-----

As a result, we have been able to outsource the production of raw and auxiliary materials involved in the
production of our pharmaceuticals to offshore suppliers based in Asia and other markets, which we believe
deliver good quality at competitive prices. In order to efficiently manage our procurement of raw materials
from these suppliers, we maintain specialized procurement offices in Shanghai (China) and Mumbai
(India).

As a manufacturer, we are subject to fluctuations in the market prices of our raw and auxiliary materials.
Additionally, our costs depend significantly on the prices we are able to negotiate with our contract
manufacturers. Under our manufacturing contracts, suppliers typically bear a portion of the loss if our
gross margin decreases as a result of lower sales prices. The pass-through mechanism that we typically rely
on is a price escalation clause which links the procurement prices we pay to our selling prices. In other
cases, we rely on renegotiations or agree specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes, such as
volumes that are put out to tender by public health insurance organizations in the context of discount
agreements (Rabattvertr¨age). Discount agreements are entered into between pharmaceutical companies,
such as us, and insurance carriers, such as national social insurance schemes. In a discount agreement the
pharmaceutical company agrees to supply certain pharmaceuticals to the insurance carrier or its customers
at a significant discount in exchange for exclusivity in the relevant product category. Discount agreements
typically have a term of one or two years.

In recent years, we have gradually increased the share of in-house production, shifting production volumes
from our contract manufacturers to our own production facilities. Furthermore, in 2019, we manufactured
71% of our production volume in lower-cost countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This
provides us with a relatively low-cost and highly flexible production base. The expansion of cost-effective
in-house production, coupled with the flexible make-or-buy approach described below, has helped us
realize both structural cost advantages and higher capacity utilization, which resulted in lower unit prices.

We take a flexible approach to our make-or-buy decisions. This means that we regularly compare our
in-house production costs to offers we receive from third-party manufacturers and are prepared to
outsource production where this would result in sustainable cost savings. In the past, our decision to
gradually insource production capacity has helped us realize higher capacity utilization. Additionally, the
fact that a large proportion of our manufacturing facilities is located in lower-cost countries has provided
us with structural cost advantages compared to some of our competitors. Together, these factors have
contributed significantly to the decrease in unit costs that we have realized in recent years.

Each year we invest in our production facilities and test laboratories in an effort to ensure they comply
with the applicable regulations and technical norms. In 2019, our investments in the expansion and
modernization of our production sites and facilities, as well as test laboratories, amounted to A61.2 million.

**_Highest Quality and Safety Standards_**

Our global control management is located centrally through our top operating company, STADA
Arzneimittel AG. As an international healthcare company, we have established high standards for the
quality of our raw materials, products, services and working conditions. The quality standards we adhere
to, both in our own manufacturing sites and those of external suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in
full compliance or even exceed applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our compliance with both
the statutory requirements and our internal standards is reviewed comprehensively each year as part of
regular audits by our global quality management teams.

In addition, the competent national authorities of each country where we operate carry out inspections on
a recurring basis. Within the European Union, such inspections typically take place every two or three
years. Outside the European Union, we often go beyond national requirements and inspections and
additionally apply for EU Good Manufacturing Practice compliance inspections (also known as EU GMP
compliance inspections). In the course of these inspections, the responsible authorities audit the
compliance of our relevant non-EU production facilities with the relevant EU GMPs. Each positive
inspection report results in a three-year extension of our existing EU import licenses for products
manufactured in these facilities. As a result, 8 of our 11 non-EU production facilities are approved for the
production and export of certain pharmaceutical dosage forms into EU countries (Banja Luka, Nizhny
Novgorod, Obninsk, Podgorica, Sabac, Tuy H`oa and Vrsac).

In addition to our compliance with the applicable legal requirements, we hold international certifications
in accordance with external quality management systems. Accordingly, at numerous production sites, we

focus not only on GMP standards but also on the relevant requirements of the International Organization
for Standardization.

(1) As of the date of this offering memorandum, one of our manufacturing facilities located in Tuy H`oa, Vietnam, is in the
validation process for EU portfolio, necessary for the EU GMP certificate inspection. EU inspection is scheduled for
September 2020, and the facility is expected to become operational in July 2020 for the local market.

(2) Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and even some of our non-European
manufacturing facilities adhere to EU manufacturing standards (EU Good Manufacturing Practice), making them eligible to
import to the EU. As a result, we have a strong performance and compliance track record. Moreover, local production provides
a natural hedge for currency fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products
in certain countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our margins and potential for
growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to improve certain aspects of our manufacturing operations to achieve our ongoing
cost savings initiatives.

**Sales and Marketing**

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated
in most countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a
new market have to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement
regimes, and distribution channels. This provides a competitive advantage to existing players with scale and
local expertise, such as us.

Building on our extensive local market expertise, we have decided to put in place decentralized marketing
teams, and the size and organization of our sales force is tailored to the local environment in each market.
In Germany, for example, we do not have a dedicated sales force, as the majority of our business is won
through tenders. As a result, our German marketing team is distinguished mostly by its sophisticated
tender management. In Belgium, our sales force targets primarily doctors who are the key decision-makers
in the market, whereas our sales teams in Italy and Spain place their emphasis on pharmacies. In Russia,
we market directly to consumers in the self-payment market. As part of our centralized supervision, our
marketing teams research each market extensively and carefully select the products we decide to offer as
part of our country portfolio, as well as their positioning. Our marketing campaigns in the United
Kingdom, for instance, emphasize the filters contained in our Ladival sunscreen products, whereas the
marketing of Ladival in Spain focuses on the cosmetic benefits of its ingredients. We believe the
combination of centralized supervision and physical proximity to our customers provides us with a
powerful sales and marketing structure.

132


-----

We have a direct sales presence in approximately 30 countries where we sell our products through our own
marketing teams, subsidiaries and branches, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors.
This includes all major European markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain.
In addition, we maintain a direct sales presence in growth markets in the MENA region (in the United
Arab Emirates), Asia (including Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines), South America
(Argentina) and Australia. Our decision to establish a direct sales presence is also driven by our local
market expertise and is a function of the product portfolio we are offering in a given market. In geographic
regions where we do not have a direct presence or where our sales presence does not cover our full
product portfolio, we partner with recognized local companies. In China and Vietnam, for example, we
also market and distribute certain of our products through distribution agreements with local partners.
Including exports, our products were marketed and sold in approximately 120 countries in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

Selective acquisitions are part of our strategy and are also used to expand our existing sales network
through vertical integration. For example, in 2016 and 2017, respectively, we acquired the British company
Natures Aid Limited to strengthen our presence in branded products in the British market, and the
Serbian pharmaceutical wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o. Beograd to strengthen our business activities in the
Serbian market. In addition to growth opportunities, we seek to identify products and markets that are
subject to particularly cumbersome regulatory requirements and to restructure our product portfolio to
further reduce our dependency on state regulated and therefore price regulated healthcare systems.

**Our Brands**

We have a large portfolio of recognizable and well regarded brands. While we hold ownership rights to
most of our brands, some of them are used under license. We in-license certain of our Generics, none of
which individually represents a material portion of our business. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.’’_

**Material Contracts**

Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this offering memorandum, we have not entered into any contracts
outside the ordinary course of our business that we consider material.

**Research and Product Development**

**_Research_**

In order to limit our research and development costs and avoid the risks inherent in the marketing of newly
developed products, our strategy is to focus on the development and marketing of generics, neither of
which requires any material spending for new active pharmaceutical ingredients. Because our business
does not require any material proprietary research, we do not typically incur material research expenses.

**_Product Development_**

As the marketing of our products normally requires the prior grant of a marketing authorization issued by
the competent regulators, we incur development costs in connection with the approval process. Given our
global product marketing, we are required to navigate a large number of different approval processes. We
generally seek to realize synergies and obtain marketing authorizations through supranational processes,
which require only a single dossier and cover a large number of countries, particularly in the European
Union. Approval procedures outside of the European Union are carried out, where possible, on the basis
of the EU dossier relating to the same product.

To ensure the optimal utilization of our resources and the effective management of our international
approval processes, we have installed a centralized development center in Bad Vilbel (Germany) and
Vrsac (Serbia). We also cooperate with external third-party developers in Europe and Asia to optimize the
management of our resources and reduce any technological gaps. In select cases, we also rely on a global
network of external development partners, through which dossiers or approvals are acquired.

**_Product Launches_**

Building on our tried and tested platform, we have released on average more than 600 new products each
year since 2014. The large majority of our new products are Generics, whereas new product launches in the
Branded Products division only make up a small share. We believe the number of our product launches is

133


-----

high compared to most of our competitors, which is evidence of our strong capabilities in the development
process and our local market expertise. Our strong performance was also supported by continued
investment in development costs. New product launches contributed more than 4% (approximately A128
million) to our sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. The chart below shows our product launches in
each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, as well as our research and development costs
in the corresponding periods:

27APR202021561698

(1) As of December 31 for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, as applicable.

(2) Represents the number of marketing authorizations and marketing applications submitted in each of the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, as applicable.

(3) R&D and in-licensing spending represents expenses for the Senior Notes Issuer, in regards to the 2018 and 2019 financial years,
and STADA, in regards to the 2017 financial year.

Due to the lengthy regulatory approval process typical of the pharmaceutical industry, we consider our
development pipeline an important indicator of our future sales. As of December 31, 2019, we were
pursuing more than 1,200 approval procedures for over 160 active pharmaceutical ingredients and
compounds in more than 50 countries. In particular, we have a large product pipeline in small molecule
Generics as we aim to be a one-stop shop and provide the full range of drugs that go off-patent. Most of
our pending applications relate to approvals for Generics within the European Union.

**_Intellectual Property_**

_Trademarks_

In each market where material sales of any of our major Branded Products are made, we register a
trademark. In addition, we continuously register trademarks in respect of new products and renew the
trademarks that are about to expire. Our principal trademarks include APO-go, Aqualor, Grippostad,
Snup, Vitaprost, Fultium, Ladival, Care, Covonia, Levomecol, Hirudoid, Zoflora and Hedrin.

**_Patents_**

As a manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals, we are not materially dependent on patents. Our key
patents include a solid pharmaceutical composition comprising Tilidine hydrochloride.

**Employees**

**_Long-term Personnel Policy_**

Through their extensive expertise and strong commitment, our employees make a substantial contribution
to our continuing success. As a result, our personnel policy focuses on long-term retention and is designed
to support the development of all of our employees. In terms of training, we offer language skills support,
specialist workshops, seminars and extra occupational study programs. In addition, we offer development
and support programs tailored to various career stages, and individual career planning. Examples of this
include exchange programs between German and foreign subsidiaries, as well as management programs.
All personal development measures aim to continuously provide the skills needed both now and in the
future, and to fill management and expert positions from within our own ranks as much as possible.

**_Development of the Number of Employees_**

In 2019, the Group had an average of 10,515 employees, compared to 10,205 in 2018. The increase of the
number of employees at year-end 2019 compared to year-end 2018 was primarily due to an increase of
employees in production activities in Serbia and Vietnam, the expansion of sales and marketing activities in
Spain and Italy as well as the initial consolidation of Biopharma. As of December 31, 2017, the number of
STADA’s employees was 10,176.

In 2019, Group had an average of 1,156 employees in Germany, compared to 1,125 in 2018 and 1,118 in
2017. The average number of employees located at STADA’s group headquarters in Bad Vilbel, Germany,
was 903 in 2019, compared to 903 in 2018 and 911 in 2017. The average number of employees outside
Germany was 9,382 in 2019, compared to 9,122 in 2018 and 9,714 in 2017.

As of December 31, 2019, women held approximately 51% of all management positions within the Group.
We believe that we have healthy relationships with our workforce, and during the periods under discussion
there have not been any material labor disruptions.

**_Pensions_**

We operate a number of pension schemes, including defined benefit schemes in certain countries in which
we operate, such as Germany and the United Kingdom.

**Insurance**

As part of our insurance program, we maintain general and product liability insurance, environmental
liability insurance, all-risk property and business interruption insurance, cargo and transport insurance,
industrial legal aid insurance, fidelity insurance, electronic insurance and credit insurance, as well as health
and accident insurance covering most subsidiaries and operations to the extent the Group considers
appropriate or otherwise as required by applicable law. We are not currently involved in any material
claims under our insurance.

**Information Technology**

Our critical information technology systems are largely operated and hosted by Fujitsu TDS. Our core
systems are centralized in data centers located in Germany where all SAP servers and SAP-related
infrastructure for information technology systems located in Western Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States are hosted. Other non-core information technology systems are operated locally by our
subsidiaries.

**Environmental**

We are subject to a number of local, national and regional laws and other requirements relating to the
protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements
relate to a broad range of our activities, including (i) product and industrial activity-related environmental
protection and (ii) the operational management of occupational safety and well-being related to hazardous
substances in production activities.

Our capital and operating budgets include the expected costs and expenses necessary to ensure compliance
with these laws. Specifically, we incur labor costs for environmental, health and safety activities, local costs
for industrial environmental protection, investments to improve workplace ergonomics and the coverage of
substance substitutions. If we do not comply with environmental requirements that apply to our operations,
regulatory agencies could seek to impose civil, administrative and/or criminal liabilities, as well as seek to
curtail our operations. Under certain circumstances, private parties could also seek to impose civil fines or
penalties for violations of environmental laws or recover monetary damages, including those relating to
property damage or personal injury.

The presence of hazardous materials at our facilities may expose us to potential liabilities associated with
the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, and we could be liable for (i) the costs of responding to
and remediating that release and (ii) the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release,
among other things. We have not incurred in the past three fiscal years, nor do we anticipate incurring,
material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations. We are not aware of any
environmental liabilities that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.

135


-----

We are committed to optimizing procedures and processes to conserve resources and minimize our impact
on the environment. Furthermore, as a result of our business model, which excludes the in-house
production of active ingredients, we do not present any significant emission risks. We are currently working
on an integrated corporate governance report which is expected to include key corporate governance
metrics and will be applicable across our entire Group.

**Joint Ventures**

We have entered into several joint ventures to access additional geographic markets, further enhance our
local market expertise, minimize costs and increase growth in areas we believe have significant business
potential. For an overview of our joint ventures, see the notes to the STADA Financial Statements
included elsewhere herein. When entering into joint ventures, we generally seek control over the joint
undertaking.

**Regulatory and Compliance**

We do business in certain countries that are subject to economic sanctions or are known to have weak
measures against money laundering and terrorist financing, including Russia, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen and
Libya. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our sales in these countries, excluding Russia, accounted for
A4.1 million. Our sales in Russia for the year ended December 31, 2019 were A263.9 million. We have
specific procedures in place to ensure that our exports into these countries comply with the relevant
international, regional and national regulations. We follow a risk-based approach, which means, for
example, prior to entering into a contract with a customer, we conduct due diligence on our customers and
obtain documentation from them that verifies their identity as well as the identity of their end-customers
and beneficial owners. In addition, we tailor our contracts to the specific contractual partners and export
countries, providing for specific payment terms and requiring specific guarantees.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time we become involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as labor law-related claims; disputes with our suppliers, authorities, non-controlling
shareholders or business partners, health and safety and environmental issues; and intellectual property
disputes. We do not currently consider any of our pending lawsuits to be material, with the exception of
one dispute in Serbia. Our Serbian subsidiary Hemofarm AD had two subsidiaries, Velefarm AD Holding
and Velefarm VFB d.o.o., both of which underwent bankruptcy proceedings in Serbia. One of the creditors
party to the bankruptcy proceedings brought a claim against Hemofarm AD, Velefarm AD Holding and
Velefarm VFB d.o.o.m seeking (i) the debt restructuring agreement entered into among, _inter alia,_
Velefarm AD Holding, Velefarm VFB d.o.o. and Hemofarm AD to be declared without effect towards the
bankruptcy estate, (ii) set-off statements No.32 and No.89 to be declared without effect towards the
bankruptcy estate and (iii) the sale and purchase agreement dated April 27, 2011 between Velefarm VFB
and Hemofarm to be declared without effect to bankruptcy estate. Our potential exposure in this litigation
amounts to approximately A36.0 million. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not set
aside provisions in respect of this dispute. Otherwise, we are currently not involved in any legal
proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect
on our financial position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings
can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

**REGULATION**

**_Covid-19_**

The global outbreak of Covid-19 has resulted in significant disruptions to businesses around the world. As
a result, several of the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented, or are in the process of
implementing, emergency legislation in order to address the impact of the pandemic, including its impact
on the availability of pharmaceuticals. For example, Serbia has implemented a temporary export ban for
certain categories of medical products to other countries. Germany has enacted legislation allowing
pharmacists to disregard, under certain conditions, rebate agreements between pharmaceutical companies
and social health insurance providers that would normally grant exclusivity to pharmaceutical companies
for certain medicinal products. In addition, the German Ministry of Health has enacted statutory measures
that would allow the relevant authorities to intervene in order to ensure a continuous supply of certain
categories of medicines to the entire population, including by prohibiting companies from supplying
certain categories of medicines to their customers, imposing restrictions on pricing or, if necessary, seizing
medical products. Italy has also enacted a wide range of emergency regulations, including measures
allowing the Italian Medicines Agency to accelerate approvals for the use of certain generics products at
the expense of the National Health System and foster cooperation with holders of marketing
authorizations and importers in order to ensure regular supply levels of certain categories of critical
medical products. Spain has enacted regulations to facilitate the use and supply of essential medical
products and devices, including measures facilitating the import of medical products and price control
regulations on certain categories of supplies. In addition, Russia has introduced temporary restrictions with
respect to the export of single-use medical devices as well as active pharmaceutical ingredients and the
procedure for registering Russian medical equipment has been significantly simplified, including for
respirators and medical masks. Russia has also passed legislation allowing the sale of non-registered,
foreign-made and single-use medical devices without obtaining permission from the Russian Federal
Service for Surveillance in Healthcare, subject to compliance with certain conditions, including a simplified
registration procedure.

We have incurred costs in order to comply with these temporary regulations. However, as of the date of
this offering memorandum, such costs have been relatively limited and current regulations have not had a
material adverse impact on our business. Because the majority of the current regulations are either
temporary in nature or provide optional measures that can be enacted in the government’s discretion but
which have not been enacted yet, there can be no assurance that future changes in regulatory measures
related to Covid-19 would not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We continue to monitor the legislative environment, particularly in regards to export bans or
any other form of direct intervention by governments in the market for medical products and supplies,
including price control measures and suspension of discount agreements, as well as in relation to
workplace safety. See ‘‘Recent Developments—Covid-19’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Any outbreak of severe
_communicable diseases, including the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto may_
_materially affect our business and results of operations.’’_

**European Union**

**_Overview (Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom)_**

The Group’s pharmaceutical business activity comprises the following regulated activity: (i) medicinal
product development (the Group does not conduct any material proprietary research for new active
pharmaceutical ingredients); (ii) medicinal product authorization; (iii) manufacturing and the
procurement of contract manufacturing; (iv) wholesale distribution and supply; (v) pharmacovigilance; and
(vi) promotion. The current range of medicinal products comprises generic, biosimilar, prescription-only
and OTC medicinal products. Each of these activities is subject to strict legislative frameworks at both
European Union and national levels compliance with which requires the expenditure of substantial
personnel and financial resources, and breach of which can result in enforcement activity under civil,
administrative and/or criminal law.

While the Group also commercializes products that are regulated as medical devices, cosmetic products
and food supplements, the text below summarizes the material licenses and regulatory aspects of the
pharmaceutical product regulatory regimes text are applicable to the material parts of the Group’s
pharmaceutical business in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, the violation of which could
result in: (i) the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations; (ii) the limitation, suspension or

137


-----

termination of service; and/or (iii) the imposition of civil, administrative and criminal penalties, including
fines.

**_European Union Pharmaceutical Regulatory Regime_**

_Non-clinical and Clinical Investigations_

Both non-clinical and clinical data (i.e., from studies involving human participants) are generally required
to support a marketing authorization for a medicinal product. Appropriate studies are therefore required,
the conduct of which in the EEA is carefully regulated under EU Directives 2010/63/EU, 2004/9/EC,
2004/10/EC and 2001/20/EC, respectively, and corresponding member state national laws. To the extent
that non-clinical research is conducted on animals, it is subject to significant legislative restrictions. In
particular, the person conducting such research and the research project itself must be authorized by a
relevant competent authority. The establishment where the animal research takes place must also be
compliant with the legislation—this entails an additional authorization under national legislation.

As regards the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, many of the legal obligations in directive 2001/20/EC
and its associated good clinical practice Directive 2005/28/EC fall on the ‘‘sponsor’’ of the clinical trial,
which is defined as the individual, company, institution or organization that takes responsibility for the
initiation, management and/or financing of a clinical trial. Before commencement of a clinical trial, the
sponsor must obtain authorization from the competent authority/ies in the member state(s) in which the
trial will be conducted. Approval from a competent national ethics committee in each of the relevant
member states is also a prerequisite to commencing a trial. The European Union clinical trial legislation
also imposes requirements regarding the conduct of directive trial itself (which must be conducted in
accordance with good clinical practice (‘‘GCP’’) to generate data acceptable for marketing authorization
submission) and safety reporting of adverse events and reactions, among other matters. If clinical trials are
conducted outside the EEA, they must likewise follow the principles set forth in European Union
legislation if their results are to be submitted in an application for marketing authorization in the
European Union in order for the data they generate to be accepted. These requirements also apply to
bioavailability studies conducted to demonstrate acceptable bioequivalence of generic medicinal products
to innovative products.

The regulation of clinical trials conducted in the EEA will undergo significant change when the European
Union Clinical Trials Regulation comes into effect, which the EMA expects to occur during 2020.

_Marketing Authorizations_

The European Union regulatory framework applicable to medicinal products is largely set forth in the
‘‘Community’’ code contained in Directive 2001/83/EC as implemented in the respective national laws of
EEA member states. Subject to certain narrow exemptions, this requires that all medicinal products,
including generic versions of authorized (including previously authorized) products, must obtain a
marketing authorization before they can be lawfully placed on the market in the EEA. There are three
main procedures for applying for marketing authorization: the Centralized Procedure (operated by the
EMA and the European Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) under EC Regulation 726/2004), the Mutual
Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure, both operated by EEA member state national
authorities under the rules set forth in Directive 2001/83/EC. It is also possible to obtain a purely national,
stand-alone authorization for products intended for marketing only in a single EEA member state.

Under the Centralized Procedure, applications must be made to the EMA for an authorization granted in
the form of a single binding Commission decision to grant a Community (as defined in the relevant
directive) marketing authorization which is simultaneously valid in each of the EEA member states. The
Centralized Procedure is mandatory for biotechnology products. It is also mandatory for advanced-therapy
medicinal products for new active substances to treat cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS,
autoimmune diseases or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, and for products designated as
orphan medicinal products. It is also available, on an optional-basis, for other new chemical entities or
innovative medicinal products, or in the interests of public health, which may also include applications for
Community marketing authorizations for non-prescription and generic medicinal products of nationally
authorized reference products. For generic marketing authorization applications of Community-authorized
reference medicinal products (which have been authorized under the Centralized Procedure), there is
automatic access to the Centralized Procedure.

138


-----

The Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure each aims to facilitate access to the
EEA single market by relying upon the principle of mutual recognition. Thus, a marketing authorization or
the assessment in one EEA member state (the reference EEA member state) ought in principle to be
recognized by the competent authorities of the other EEA member states (the concerned EEA member
states (‘‘CMSs’’), unless there are grounds for supposing that the authorization of the medicinal product
concerned may present a serious risk to public health. Under both procedures, if the application is
successful, the CMSs grant a national marketing authorization for the medicinal product.

Under all marketing authorization procedures the applicant must submit a dossier containing, among
other items, data demonstrating the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product. For generic
medicinal products, there are reduced data submission requirements (no preclinical or clinical study results
are required although bioequivalence must be substantiated, usually via appropriate bioavailability
studies). For similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) some preclinical and/or clinical studies
performed for the original reference product may not need to be reproduced as a biosimilar application is
based on a comparison between the biosimilar and its reference medicine to show that there are no
significant differences between them.

At the time of the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product, the competent authority
must specify the classification of the product as either prescription only or not. National laws may make
provision for certain sub-categories. It is open to the marketing authorization holder to subsequently apply
for an amendment of this classification (either way) subject to filing relevant supporting additional data.

_Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing_

The European Union Community Code in directive 2001/83/EC contains substantial requirements for the
manufacturing of medicinal products, which are required to be manufactured in accordance with the
principles of GMP set forth in Commission directive 2003/94/EC. Manufacturing activity includes the
importing of or the total or partial manufacture (including the various processes of dividing up, packaging
and presenting) of medicinal products. There are also prescriptive requirements relating to the content
and design of the packaging and labeling of medicinal products. These include certain mandatory
information which must be stated on the product label, packaging and patient information leaflet.

The manufacturer must ensure that all manufacturing operations for medicinal products subject to a
marketing authorization are carried out in accordance with the information provided in the application for
marketing authorization as accepted by the competent authorities. Any manufacturing operation or linked
operation, that is carried out under contract for the manufacturer, must be the subject of a written contract
between the manufacturer and the subcontractor which defines and allocates the responsibilities of each
party and which defines, in particular, the observances of GMP to be followed by each party. The
manufacturer must monitor and review the subcontractor’s performance.

If manufacturing activity is undertaken within the EEA, a valid manufacturing authorization from the
relevant member state is required for the category of products concerned and which covers the type of
manufacturing activity undertaken (e.g., importing or packaging, etc.). The holder of a manufacturing
authorization is obligated to comply with the principles and guidelines of GMP for medicinal products and
to use as starting materials only active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been manufactured in
accordance with the GMP for active substances. Excipients for use in medicinal products must also be
produced in accordance with appropriate GMP to be determined following a formal risk assessment. As a
matter of GMP compliance, the manufacturer must verify via site audits that suppliers and distributors of
active substances are each complying with GMP and good distribution practice principles. Manufacturers
are subject to regular inspections by competent authorities to assess their compliance with GMP.
Manufacturers must also appoint a ‘‘qualified person’’ who is responsible for certifying that individual
batches of medicinal product satisfy legal requirements.

Manufacturing authorizations must be issued by the member state authority where the manufacturing
activity and plant is located and are holder-and site-specific. European Union member state competent
authorities also undertake regular GMP inspections of manufacturers located in countries outside the
EEA that are engaged in the manufacture of medicinal products to be supplied to the European Union. A
European Union-based manufacturer may only import active substances from outside the EEA if the
active substances have been manufactured in accordance with GMPs equivalent to European Union GMPs
for active substances, and if they are accompanied by a written confirmation from the competent authority
of the exporting third country, which as regards the plant manufacturing the exported active substance,
confirms that the standards of GMP and control of the plant are equivalent to those in the EEA.

139


-----

Alternatively, active substances may be imported from countries on the approved list of recognized
GMP-equivalent countries operated by the Commission.

Since 2019, the European Union falsified medicines legislation (now incorporated in Directive 2001/83/EC
and in delegated directives) has imposed additional obligations on manufacturers regarding certain safety
and anti-tamper features to be included in product packaging (where required).

_Distribution_

Entities undertaking the wholesale distribution of medicinal products are also required to hold a wholesale
dealer’s authorization from the EEA member state where the distribution is taking place and must fulfill
certain requirements concerning the suitability and adequacy of premises, installations and equipment, so
as to ensure the proper conservation and distribution of the medicinal products. These requirements also
extend to staff. In particular, a distributor must have a qualified ‘‘responsible person’’ who meets national
legislative requirements regarding qualifications.

Wholesale distribution includes all activities relating to procuring, holding, supplying or exporting
medicinal products, other than supplying medicinal products to the public. Such activities are carried out
by manufacturers or their depositories, importers or other wholesale distributors or by pharmacists and
persons authorized or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public in the member state concerned.

Distributors are subject to regular site and system inspections by competent authorities to assess the
distributor’s compliance with applicable legal requirements in the Community Code in
directive 2001/83/EC, which include compliance with the principles of European Union GDP. Distributors
must keep certain records and documentation (particularly for the purposes of facilitating product and
batch recall) and must operate a quality system and have a plan for the effective implementation of recalls.
Distributors are also obligated to confirm that entities from whom they obtain supplies of medicinal
products have the appropriate authorizations and, where applicable, have complied with GDP principles.
They may also only supply entities who possess appropriate authorizations.

Since 2019, the European Union’s falsified medicines legislation has imposed additional obligations on
distributors regarding the verification of specified safety and anti-tamper features to be included in
product packaging (where required).

_Pharmacovigilance_

‘‘Pharmacovigilance’’ refers to the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem. Marketing
authorization holders are subject to detailed and extensive risk management and pharmacovigilance
obligations under Directive 2001/83/EC and EC Regulation 726/2004 and the associated guideline on good
pharmacovigilance practices. Among other matters, these include the implementation of risk minimization
measures on a per-product basis as well as a requirement for the marketing authorization holder to
operate a pharmacovigilance system to monitor the safety of authorized medicinal products and to detect
any change to their risk benefit balance. Details of the pharmacovigilance system must be set forth in the
pharmacovigilance system master file, which must be maintained by the marketing authorization holder
and kept available for inspection by competent authorities upon request. The marketing authorization
holder must establish and use a ‘‘quality system’’ to perform its pharmacovigilance obligations.

The pharmacovigilance obligations of the marketing authorization holder include detailed obligations
regarding reporting. For example, a marketing authorization holder must record all suspected adverse
reactions in the EEA or in countries outside the EEA that are brought to its attention, and report such
information via the centralized Eudravigilance database. The marketing authorization holder must also
submit periodic safety updates to the EMA regarding the benefits and risks of the medicinal product.
Other pharmacovigilance obligations are imposed regarding the availability to the marketing authorization
holder of appropriate personnel and resources. For example, the marketing authorization holder must
have permanently and continuously at its disposal an appropriately ‘‘qualified person responsible for
pharmacovigilance’’ who resides in the EEA.

_Promotion_

Directive 2001/83/EC sets out strict rules for the advertising of medicinal products. The concept of
advertising is broadly defined and includes any form of door-to-door information, canvassing activity or
inducement designed to promote the prescription, supply, sale or consumption of medicinal products.
Advertising must not be misleading and there is a positive obligation for the advertising to encourage the
rational use of a medicinal product, among other matters. All promotional materials and activities must
also comply with the official ‘‘Summary of Product Characteristics’’ which is always issued for an
authorized medicinal product by the authorizing competent authority.

The advertising of medicines in the European Union is permitted subject to certain restrictions in
Directive 2001/83/EC as implemented into EU Member State laws. For example, the advertising of
unauthorized medicines is prohibited. This includes the advertising of a medicine before a marketing
authorization has been granted, as well as the advertising of an authorized medicine for uses
(i.e., therapeutic indications) outside the scope of its marketing authorization (so-called ‘‘off label’’ uses).
Advertising of prescription-only medicines to the general public is also prohibited, as is the provision of
samples to the public for promotional purposes. In addition, European Union legislation gives EEA
member states a certain degree of flexibility to ensure the adequate and effective monitoring of
advertising, and detailed rules regarding promotion and monitoring are consequently not fully harmonized
across the EEA.

_Sanctions for Infringement Under European Union Law_

Under Commission Regulation 658/2007, the Commission may directly impose financial penalties where
the holder of a Community marketing authorization has intentionally or negligently breached certain
obligations set forth in European Union pharmaceutical legislation. The power to impose financial
penalties applies in cases where the infringement may have significant public health implications in the
EEA; where it has a EEA dimension by taking place or having its effects in more than one member state;
or where interests of the EEA are involved.

In the event of an infringement, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 5% of the marketing
authorization holder’s turnover in the EEA in the preceding year. If the infringement is ongoing, the
Commission may impose penalty payments per day of up to 2.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s
average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until such time as the infringement is
terminated. The Commission may also impose a fine of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s
EEA turnover in the preceding business year if the marketing authorization holder fails to cooperate with
the Commission’s investigation of the potential breach. If the noncooperation continues, the Commission
may impose penalty payments per day of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily
EEA turnover in the preceding business year until the noncooperation is terminated.

EU Regulation 2017/2394/EU on consumer protection cooperation between enforcement authorities came
into force on January 17, 2020. This regulation aims at boosting cross-border public enforcement of
European Union consumer protection rules, which includes Directive 2001/83/EC, the Community Code
on medicinal products. There are current Commission proposals to amend this regulation to strengthen
the penalties for breaches of European Union consumer law by introducing fines based upon percentages
of the infringer’s turnover.

_Enforcement Under National Law_

Enforcement of the regulatory requirements outlined above takes place at a national level and is
underpinned by national member state law.

_Enforcement Under United Kingdom Law_

European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is generally enforced in the United Kingdom under
criminal law via offenses set forth in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and the Medicines Act 1968.
A person guilty of an offense is generally liable to up to two years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.
Liability can arise for a corporate offender and for individual officers of the company (or any person
purporting to act in such capacity). Members of the company may also be liable if the affairs of the
company are managed by its members.

The United Kingdom competent authority has a range of enforcement powers. As well as prosecuting the
company and/or individual responsible, the competent authority has investigatory powers enabling it to

141


-----

enter, inspect and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authority can also
suspend or revoke any United Kingdom marketing authorization, manufacturing authorization or
wholesale dealer authorization, thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities.

_Enforcement Under German Law_

European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is implemented and indirectly enforced in Germany
mainly via the Medicinal Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz) and various ordinances passed thereunder.
General laws also applicable to the business behavior of pharmaceutical companies are the Administrative
Offences Act (Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz), the Health Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz)—as far as
promotional measures are concerned—and the Criminal Code with its anti-fraud and anti-kickback
provisions. A person guilty of an offense can be liable to a fine or imprisonment under administrative or
criminal law, depending on the nature of the violation. For example, any person who acts negligently or
who willfully or negligently fails to operate a pharmacovigilance system or fails to fulfill certain general
pharmacovigilance obligations shall be deemed to have committed an administrative offense. Committing
an administrative offense may result in a fine not exceeding A25,000. A violation of the Health Advertising
Act can lead to an administrative offense; however, in practice, these aspects (such as requests for
preliminary injunctions initiated by a competitor or competition associations) are mainly dealt with in civil
law proceedings.

The German competent authorities, which are both authorities at the national level (particularly the
Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM)) and at the regional level (the administrative
authorities in the respective federal states) have a range of enforcement powers. As well as the power to
prosecute a company and/or individual responsible, the competent authorities have investigatory powers
enabling them to enter, inspect and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent
authorities can also suspend or revoke any German marketing authorization or manufacturing
authorization, wholesale dealer authorization, thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these
respective activities. As regards enforcement of the restrictions on promotional activities, in practice this is
typically done through civil law proceedings brought by competitors and/or associations for fair
competition.

_Enforcement Under Italian Law_

European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is enforced in Italy under criminal and
administrative sanctions set forth in Legislative Decrees 211/2003 and 219/2006. A person guilty of an
offense is generally liable to up to three years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine unless the act
constitutes a more serious offense under the Italian Criminal Code. For instance, Article 443 of the
Criminal Code makes the administration of faulty medicinal products (i.e., expired drugs) a punishable
offense and provides for penalties of up to three years of imprisonment and unlimited fines. In addition,
under Article 445 of the Criminal Code, the trade of medicinal substances, in species, quality or quantity
not corresponding to medical orders, or different from that declared or agreed, is punishable with
imprisonment of six months to two years and with a fine of A103-1,032.

Moreover, Legislative Decree 211/2003 establishes the administrative liability of legal entities (including
companies) for organizational negligence in cases in which an executive staff member or employee (i.e., a
director, manager or senior executive) is convicted for certain criminal offenses (i.e., bribery and
corruption, money laundering, corporate crimes, environmental crimes or crimes against industry and
trade, etc.) committed, for the benefit or the advantage of the company, by its representatives. In
particular, Legislative Decree 211/2003 sets out (i) monetary penalties (a fine up to Euro A1,549,000) and
(ii) disqualifying measures, such as the suspension or revocation of licenses, authorizations and concessions
(i.e., pharma licenses), a prohibition on entering into agreements with public entities (i.e., public tenders),
disqualification from the performance of an activity, the exclusion or revocation of loans and contributions,
and a ban against advertising goods and services.

Companies may avoid this administrative liability by approving and actually implementing a suitable
compliance program for the organization with a system of procedures and supervisory activities aimed at
preventing the commission of such offenses, and appoint a Supervisory Body (Organismo di Vigilanza)
aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the compliance program. However, the release from liability of the
company depends on the ‘‘suitability judgement’’ and the determination on the preventive effectiveness of
the organizational, administrative and control model, which the criminal judge must give in criminal
proceedings to the detriment of the offender. This means that in the event of a final conviction for an

142


-----

offense listed in the catalogue of Legislative Decree 211/2003, if the criminal judge concerned finds that
(i) the compliance program adopted by the company is not suitable for preventing the specific crime
concerned, (ii) the compliance program has not been effectively implemented or (iii) the activities of the
Supervisory Board are insufficient, the company will be liable and subject to the administrative penalties
described above.

In addition, the Italian authorities competent for pharmacovigilance are entrusted with a wide range of
enforcement powers relevant to their own areas of competence, including (i) undertaking inspections and
audits, (ii) modifying, suspending and revoking authorizations (including those for marketing,
manufacturing, import, wholesale distribution and advertising) and (iii) issuing interdictory measures or
monetary fines.

_Enforcement Under Spanish Law_

The Spanish pharmaceutical industry enforcement regime mainly comprises administrative law rules and
regulates the clinical investigation, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, pharmacovigilance and
promotion of medicinal products. In line with European Union legislation, medicinal products must
receive a marketing authorization granted by the Spanish Agency of Medicinal Products (‘‘AEMPS’’),
which belongs to the Ministry of Health and Social Services, before medicinal products can be placed on
the market. Additionally, manufacturers, importers and marketers of medicinal products are required to
hold an authorization granted by the AEMPS. Authorization holders shall comply with security,
effectiveness, identification and information obligations regarding the medicinal products marketed. Once
the regulatory authorizations are granted, the latter are added to the AEMPS registry and communicated
to the EMA for information purposes that are available to the public.

Spanish state and regional authorities are empowered to investigate any conduct, to enter into any
establishment or to seize any sample in order to verify compliance of the legislation. Failure to comply with
the legislation may result in administrative fines that can be imposed on the authorization holder of up to
A30,000 for minor infringements, A90,000 for serious infringements or A1,000,000, or five times the value of
the medicinal products involved, for very serious infringements; seizure of the illegal benefit obtained;
closure of the establishment; suspension of corresponding activities or/and the withdrawal of the medicinal
product from the market.

Additionally, if the aforementioned conduct, and other related conduct described in articles 361 et seq. of
the Spanish Criminal Code, endanger human life and health, those provisions establish as penalties for the
person who commits the criminal offense a prison sentence of up to four years, a fine which will depend on
his or her economic situation and a specific disqualification from the exercise of his or her profession or
from trading. In some circumstances the company itself can be liable for the conduct perpetuated by its
employees, in which case, article 366 of the Spanish Criminal Code provides for fines up to five times the
medicinal products involved and anticipates the possibility of also imposing other penalties, such as the
winding up of the company, suspension of its activity, closure of its establishments, prohibition from
carrying out its activities, prohibiting the obtaining public subsidies and judicial intervention.

**Russia**

**_Overview_**

The development, non-clinical/clinical trial development, registration, manufacture, safety, storage,
transportation, advertising, sale, use and destruction of pharmaceuticals in the Russian Federation is
strictly regulated by national laws, and since May 6, 2017 by the regulations of the Eurasian Economic
Union (the ‘‘EAEU’’) on the united pharmaceutical market, formed by its members Armenia, Belorussia,
Kazakhstan, Kirgizia and Russia. The regulations of the EAEU as international law take precedence over
national legislation. The EAEU regulations cover the registration of pharmaceuticals, labelling, packaging,
good practices and pharmacovigilance. Obtaining clinical trial approvals, licensing, price formation, state
procurement and advertising are the exclusive competence of each member state.

_Non-clinical/Clinical Trial Development_

Prior to applying for the registration of a pharmaceutical product, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are
arranged by a ‘‘sponsor,’’ if necessary. The sponsor is the organization with a license to conduct
pharmaceutical activities, which owns the results of the studies and/or the relevant pharmaceutical

143


-----

manufacturing technologies. All studies must confirm the pharmaceutical quality of the products and
demonstrate their safety and efficacy.

For non-clinical studies (biomedical studies not performed on human subjects), the laboratory where the
relevant research takes place is subject to strict controls by the Federal Service for Surveillance in
Healthcare. Pursuant to EAEU legislation, preclinical research on animals shall not be conducted with
respect to generic drugs.

The sponsor is obligated to conduct relevant studies according to the clinical trial permission granted by
the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Such permission is granted after the Ministry conducts a
review of the application and accompanying documents submitted by the sponsor or any person authorized
by the developer.

Clinical research conducted on humans is subject to stringent regulations imposed by the Ministry of
Health and the Ethical Board of the Russian Federation. In particular, a person conducting such research
(i.e., the ‘‘principal investigator’’) must have relevant experience consisting of at least three years of studies
in clinical trials and extensive medical practice in the relevant therapeutic area. In addition, the institution
where the research takes place must be authorized by the Ministry of Health. Clinical trials must be
conducted in accordance with GCP. Successful results of clinical trials are a mandatory condition for the
registration of a pharmaceutical product.

_Registration Process_

Pharmaceuticals can be manufactured, stored, transported, sold, used or destroyed only upon obtaining a
registration certificate (or a marketing authorization) issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian
Federation.

At the applicant’s option, the registration procedure can be carried out in accordance with Russian or
EAEU regulations. Depending on the option chosen, an issued registration certificate will be valid in the
territory of the Russian Federation or in all EAEU member states, respectively. After December 31, 2020,
applicants for new registrations must file documents only with the EAEU (the national procedure will not
be applicable). All valid registration dossiers of those pharmaceuticals that were previously registered
under national rules must be brought into full compliance with the unified rules of the EAEU by
December 31, 2025.

Under Russian regulations, the duration of the registration process ranges from 80 working days (for the
registration of the first three generic pharmaceuticals) to 130 working days (for generic and original
pharmaceuticals), excluding a possible suspension for up to 90 days. EAEU regulations envisage 210
calendar days as the maximum duration of the registration process, excluding two possible suspensions of
up to 90 days each. Clinical trials are not included in that term. Usually the whole registration process
takes at least one and a half to two years for original and approximately eight to twelve months for generic
pharmaceuticals.


Usually, the official fee for the examination of pharmaceuticals amounts to 325,000 plus an additional28APR202007553764

28APR20200755376410,000 in order to obtain a registration certificate issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian

Federation. The cost of clinical trials is calculated individually for each pharmaceutical and is not included
in the official fee. EAEU registration official fees are approved at the governmental level. The results of
clinical trials conducted in other EAEU states as well as in the member states of the International
Conference on the Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use may be accepted as part of the application.

After being granted, the registration certificate can be annulled by the Ministry of Health for a number of
reasons, including danger to health, infringement of the rights of a third-party in the absence of the
pharmaceutical from the Russian market for more than three years, among others.

Violations such as manufacturing or selling of unregistered pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to


28APR2020075537645,000,000 or to the suspension of the licensed activity for up to 90 days. Suspension of the activity can

only be ordered by a court. If violations have not been remedied after the expiration of the suspension
period, the license for manufacturing pharmaceuticals (see below) can be annulled upon application of the
appropriate regulatory body by a ruling of the court.

If the value of the manufactured or sold unregistered pharmaceuticals exceeds 100,000, an individual28APR202007553764
(such as a senior executive or another employee of the company) found responsible may be subject to
criminal sanctions of up to eight years of imprisonment and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 3,000,000 or28APR202007553764


144


-----

(ii) the income of the offender for a period from six months to three years. The offender may also be
prohibited from occupying certain posts or engaging in certain activities for up to five years.

In the case of the death of two or more people or grievous harm caused by an unregistered pharmaceutical,
the term of imprisonment can be up to twelve years with a fine in the amount of: (i) up to 5,000,000 or28APR202007553764
(ii) the income of the responsible person for a period of two to five years. The offender may also be
prohibited from occupying certain posts or engaging in certain activities for up to ten years.

_Manufacturing and Distributing Pharmaceuticals_

Manufacturing pharmaceuticals requires a license and a GMP certificate, both of which are issued by the
Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. Manufacturing pharmaceuticals without a
license is a criminal offense and may lead to imprisonment for up to eight years and a fine in the amount
of: (i) up to 3,000,000 or (ii) the income of the offender for one to three years.28APR202007553764

If ethanol is used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical substance, it must be recorded in the Unified
State Automated System (‘‘USAS’’) (‘‘28APR202007553907’’) in order to control the volumes and circulation of
pharmaceutical products containing alcohol. Failure to comply with the USAS record requirements can
lead to a fine of up to 200,000 and to the confiscation of the pharmaceutical products. On January 1,28APR202007553764
2018, new requirements relating to ethanol usage entered into force. Pursuant to these new requirements,
if ethanol (or ethanol as a pharmaceutical substance) is used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical
products or medical devices, it must be recorded in USAS in order to control the volumes of manufacture
and circulation of pharmaceutical products containing alcohol.

For laboratory activities that use agents that cause infectious diseases and genetically modified organisms
of a pathogenicity level of III and IV, a company needs a license or has to rely on companies with such
licenses. The license is issued by the Federal Service on Surveillance for Consumer Rights Protection and
Human Well-being. A major change of control of a license-holder entity is subject to prior approval by a
special governmental committee.

The distribution (whether wholesale or retail) of pharmaceuticals requires a license for pharmaceutical
activity, issued by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. A recent law (dd. April 3, 2020
No. 105-FZ) allows the online purchase and sale of OTC drugs, although the Russian government is still
considering the mechanics required for the implementation of such law.

The manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals containing narcotics, psychotropic substances or
their precursors is subject to an additional license for the circulation of such substances. The license is
issued by the Federal Service for Supervision in Healthcare of the Russian Federation.

Violation of the regulations the manufacture or distribution of pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to


28APR20200755376430,000 provided such actions do not violate licensing requirements (mandatory requirements with which

license holder must comply). As a general rule, violation of any licensing requirements can lead to a fine of

28APR202007553764up to 40,000. Major violations of the license requirements can lead to a fine of up to 200,000 or a28APR202007553764

suspension of the licensed activity (e.g., distribution) for up to 90 days. The activity can be suspended only
upon a ruling by a court. If major violations have not been remedied after the expiration of the suspension
period, the license can be annulled upon application to a court by the respective regulatory body.

_Pharmacovigilance (Pharmaceutical Safety Monitoring)_

A company is required to establish a phamacovigilance system, which includes the appointment of a
qualified person to collect, assess and report safety information with regard to the benefit/risk assessment
of the product and any adverse events.

After a product registration certificate has been granted, the registration certificate holder must submit
periodic safety reports to the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. In addition, the registration
certificate holder must continuously monitor the benefit/risk balance of the product and implement and
monitor procedures for the performance of adverse event collection, evaluation and reporting, the
updating of risk management plans and must take other pharmacovigilance measures.

The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare will inform the Ministry of Health of any negative
safety information it obtains, as a result of which the latter can suspend the circulation of the
pharmaceutical or revoke the registration certificate.

145


-----

For the nondisclosure of adverse events, the registration certificate holder can be charged with a fine of up

28APR202007553764to 70,000. If such nondisclosure creates a danger to people, animals or the environment, the individual

responsible may bear criminal liability and be charged with a fine of up to 300,000 and imprisoned for up28APR202007553764
to two years. The offender may also be prohibited from holding certain positions and engaging in certain
activities for a period of up to three years or, in the case of serious harm caused by such non-disclosure, the
offender can be charged with a fine of up to 500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years.28APR202007553764

_Promotion of Pharmaceuticals_

The promotion of registered pharmaceuticals is permitted, subject to certain restrictions. For example, the
advertising of pharmaceuticals may not: (i) contain specific cases of recovery or expressions of gratitude
from patients, (ii) create an impression of the advantages of the product by referring to mandatory clinical
trials, (iii) create an impression of the necessity of using the advertised product for certain diseases,
(iv) create an impression of the absence of the need to consult a healthcare professional, (v) guarantee the
positive impact or safety of, and the absence of any side effects caused by, the advertised product,
(vi) advertise a pharmaceutical product as a biologically active supplement or (vii) claim that the safety and
efficiency of the pharmaceutical product are guaranteed by its natural origin.

Prescription pharmaceuticals can be advertised only during special events for healthcare professionals or in
media specially designated for healthcare professionals. In such cases, advertising may refer to specific
patient case studies. Prescription pharmaceuticals may not be advertised to consumers.

Advertising compliance is regulated by the Federal Antitrust Service of the Russian Federation. Violation
of the pharmaceuticals advertising legislation can lead to a fine up to 28APR202007553764500,000 for each individual
violation.

_VEP Circulation_

The Russian government approves a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (‘‘VEP’’) annually. This list
includes international nonproprietary names of pharmaceuticals for treating the most common or top
priority conditions. VEPs’ maximum prices must be approved by and registered with the Ministry of Health
and Federal Antitrust Service. Overpricing can result in a fine of double the amount of excess earnings
(i.e., the amount earned by the overcharge) for the period of the violations, up to a maximum period of
one year.

VEPs produced abroad are subject to restrictions for state procurement purposes: if two or more national
or EAEU analogous products participate in a state procurement procedure, the foreign product is
excluded from the tender.

National manufacturers of VEPs can also apply for subsidies from the government.

**Reimbursement of Medicinal Products**

**_The European Union Directive on the Transparency of Measures Regulating the Pricing of Medicinal_**
**_Products (89/105/EEC)_**

Directive 89/105/EEC places obligations on EEA member states in respect of their regulation of the
pricing of medicinal products. These obligations include: prescribed time periods in which a competent
authority must respond to an application for approval of the price of or increase in the price of a medicinal
product (where such approval is required before the product can be marketed or the price increase
implemented, respectively); obligations to regularly review price freezes to consider the justification of
such price freezes and prescribed time periods for announcing the results of such reviews; requirements to
give reasons for certain decisions; obligations to publish prescribed information and provide prescribed
information to the Commission regarding products for which prices have been fixed and the prices that
may be charged, including any price increases; and time periods for communicating decisions (including
exclusions) on whether reimbursement of a medicinal product will be covered by a national health
insurance system. These obligations include communicating criteria used by national social security systems
for the therapeutic classification of medicinal products as well as criteria used by competent authorities to
verify transfer pricing used by companies for active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediatemanufactured or finished medicinal products.

Member States are also obligated to publish information and to communicate to the Commission
regarding the methods and criteria they apply to define profitability, return on sales and/or return on

146


-----

capital, including the ranges of target profit permitted and the maximum percentage of profit permitted to
persons placing medicinal products on the market.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Germany_**

_Reimbursement Regime_

Health insurance coverage is compulsory in Germany. There are two different types of insurance:
(i) statutory health insurance and (ii) private health insurance. For an employee, membership in the
statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless their income rises above an annually determined
threshold. In the German healthcare system medicinal products are reimbursed to the patient, either by
the statutory health insurance, in which case the patient does not need to pay directly for the products
(except for a low co-payment), or by the private health insurance, in which case the patient first pays for
the product and then receives a reimbursement from the private health insurer.

For reimbursements of medicinal products under statutory health insurance, a distinction needs to be
made between prescription drugs and nonprescription drugs. Prescription-only medicinal products are only
available on prescription by a doctor, dentist or veterinarian (Section 48 of the German Medicinal
Products Act). In general, under current rules and regulations, the reimbursement system applies to all
prescription drugs with the exception of:

- medicinal products for the treatment of colds and flu-like infections, including cold remedies,
painkillers, cough steaming treatment or cough expectorants;

- mouth and throat therapeutics not involving fungal infection;

- laxatives;

- medication for travel sickness;

- medication that primarily focuses on improving the quality of life;

- erectile dysfunction;

- increase of sexual potency;

- cessation of smoking;

- emaciation;

- curbing appetite;

- weight regulation; and

- improvement of hair growth.

The reimbursement of nonprescription medicinal products is restricted. In general, nonprescription
products are not part of the reimbursement system if the insured person is more than twelve years old and
does not have a developmental disorder before the end of the 18th year of life (Section 34 para.1 of
Volume V of the Social Insurance Code). Outside the reimbursement framework manufacturers are
permitted to set prices at will.

_Price-Setting_

For the sale of medicinal products, German law provides for a pricing framework to ensure consistent
prices for the same medicinal products. For the ‘‘pharmaceutical entrepreneur’’ (usually the marketing
authorization holder) of medicinal products, the principle of free pricing for products generally applies.
However, a restriction on free pricing may result from the ‘‘benefit assessment’’ according to the Social
Insurance Code. In essence, the marketing authorization holder must prove additional benefits over
comparable available products. If the marketing authorization holder fails and there is no therapeutic
improvement on the basis of the benefit assessment then the medicinal product will be added to the
existing reference pricing list. This also has an economic pressure effect on the marketing authorization
holder to reduce prices to the existing reference pricing list in order to be competitive in the market. If an
innovative (i.e., nongeneric) medicinal product demonstrates additional benefits because there is a
therapeutic improvement then the price can be negotiated between the marketing authorization holder
and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds. For products in the generics
market there is a mandatory discount of 10% of the ex-factory price if they are distributed at the expense

147


-----

of the public health care system (Section 130a of Volume V of the Social Insurance Code). There can also
be other restrictions in Volume V of the Social Insurance Code, such as a regulation of reference prices
and compulsory manufacturer discounts.

In addition, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur must guarantee a uniform sales price for medicinal products
that are to be dispensed exclusively in pharmacies and are subject to reimbursement by the statutory health
insurance.

In the case of nonprescription medicinal products that are to be reimbursed by the statutory health
insurance, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur shall specify its uniform sales price from which exceptions may
be made in individual cases (Section 78 of the Medicinal Products Act).

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in England & Wales_**

In England and Wales, the measures adopted for regulating the pricing of medicines vary according to the
type of medicine. The generic term ‘‘Government’’ is used in this context to refer to the Department of
Health and other United Kingdom NHS bodies running the public health service in England and Wales.

_Branded Medicines_

The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2014 (the ‘‘PPRS’’) is a voluntary scheme open to
manufacturers and suppliers which regulates the pricing of branded medicines (including branded
generics) supplied to the United Kingdom NHS and which was in place until the end of 2018. It therefore
did not cover sales of unbranded generics to the United Kingdom NHS or any sales outside the United
Kingdom NHS (e.g., private prescription sales or non-United Kingdom NHS OTC sales). According to
Government figures released at the end of 2016, in 2015 almost 90% of branded medicines supplied to the
United Kingdom NHS were supplied by PPRS members.

Key features of the PPRS was as follows:

- A profit cap for individual members who elected to be part of the scheme and a general repayment
across all members where United Kingdom NHS spend on branded medicines exceeds predicted
growth levels.

- In relation to product pricing, there is freedom of pricing at launch where new active substances were
granted marketing authorization, including line extensions of such new medicines within five years of
the marking authorization. However, this freedom was limited by an expectation that pricing would be
‘‘close’’ to value assessments for new medicines provided by the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence (now called the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), an executive
non-departmental Government body.

- All other pricing, including price increases or variations, are subject to Governmental consent. There
were flexible pricing options or special rules for defined scenarios (such as new indications), but the
Government generally had discretion as to what was accepted.

Therefore, under the PPRS, although the technical position is freedom of pricing at launch, there were
notable constraints on individual product pricing and the profit/repayment mechanisms influence PPRS
members’ pricing across their portfolios. The PPRS was not a reimbursement scheme as such, but rather a
system to control the profitability of persons placing branded medicinal products on the market.

The Government does not use external reference pricing for medicines, but United Kingdom prices are
often used as reference pricing elsewhere and the above factors will be relevant where that is the case.

The PPRS expired on December 31, 2018. In a November 23, 2018 announcement, the Government and
the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry confirmed that the replacement will be called the
2019 Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing and Access (and known as ‘‘the Voluntary Scheme’’
for short). It is believed that the full final contents of the Voluntary Scheme will be published during
December 2018. Based on preliminary indications to industry, there is as yet no reason to expect significant
divergence from the current PPRS on the above points, but that is dependent on last-minute negotiation
and potential changes to the announced position.

_The Statutory Scheme_

Suppliers of branded medicines that elected not to be subject to the PPRS or which were required to leave
the PPRS by virtue of a notice served by the Secretary of State are subject to a statutory scheme for sales to

148


-----

the United Kingdom NHS. The statutory scheme in force since April 1, 2018 replaced a system involving a
mandatory 15% price cut on the United Kingdom NHS list price of medicines on sale on December 1,
2013 with the following two forms of price regulations:

- a repayment mechanism based on a percentage of suppliers’ net sales income (which is initially 7.8%
and which is expected to be 9.9% for 2019) and modelled on that currently applicable under the
PPRS; and

- a mechanism for the setting of maximum prices that may be charged by a manufacturer or supplier,

unless in either case the medicines were procured under a contract subject to public procurement
legislation entered into on or before April 1, 2018 and/or entered into following a tender that closed on or
before that date (including call-off contracts under a framework agreement entered into on or before that
date, even if the call off itself is entered into after that date).

The Government has recently consulted on amendments to the statutory scheme rules and is expected to
make amendments to the statutory scheme.

_Unbranded Generics_

In principle, there is freedom of pricing for unbranded generic prescription-only pharmaceuticals, which
are subject to competition on the open market. However, the following two factors may influence prices
charged by generic suppliers:

- The price at which pharmacists are reimbursed for dispensing prescription generics is set by the ‘‘Drug
Tariff,’’ Part VIIIA of which lists reimbursement prices for the vast majority of generic prescription
pharmaceuticals. Different methods for calculating reimbursement pricing have been applied to
different categories of generics. However, the Health Service Products (Provision and Disclosure of
Information) Regulations 2018 introduced mandatory information retention, and mandatory
information provision on request, in relation to sales and income provision by all suppliers of
unbranded generics to facilitate Drug Tariff pricing. Although some provisions of these June 2018
Regulations came into force in January 2019, the provisions relating to information on unbranded
generics are already in force.

- Section 262 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (as amended in 2017 by the Health Service
Medical Supplies Costs Act 2017) grants the Government power to limit any price charged by the
supplier of any medicine to the United Kingdom NHS where that medicine is not covered by a
voluntary scheme. This would in theory apply to (i) branded medicines subject to the statutory
scheme, (ii) unbranded generics, (iii) OTC medicines dispensed under a prescription unless caught by
the PPRS (see ‘‘—OTC Sales’’) or (iv) a medicine sold OTC to the United Kingdom NHS. However,
any enforcement under s262 requires a proactive step by the Government and consultation with a
relevant industry body (such as a trade association).

_OTC Sales_

The only potential pricing constraint on the sale of products that are actually sold OTC is s262 of the
National Health Service Act 2006 (see ‘‘—Unbranded Generics’’), and then only for OTC sales to the
United Kingdom NHS. Otherwise, the sale of products OTC is free on the open market.

Where OTC medicines are prescribed on the United Kingdom NHS, two features may influence a
supplier’s pricing:

- The cost of purchasing and dispensing an OTC medicine prescribed on the United Kingdom NHS is
in principle reimbursable to community pharmacies, unless it features on a ‘‘black list’’ of
nonreimbursable products that forms part of the Drug Tariff.

- Where an OTC medicine’s prescription sales are below £50,000, the Government may exercise
discretion to exclude such sales from PPRS calculations relevant to the profit cap and the industry
repayment. A PPRS member company should therefore note that any sales of prescribed OTC
products will count towards such calculations, where the Government has not exercised this discretion.

For non-PPRS members, the Government has confirmed that OTC sales (including where OTC products
are prescribed) are not subject to the statutory scheme.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Italy_**

In order to be placed on the market, medicinal products must be priced and assigned (by AIFA, the Italian
Medicines Agency) to a class (i.e., classes A, H, C and C-bis). These classes are used to identify whether or
not the cost of a medicinal product is charged to the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario
_Nazionale) (the ‘‘Italian NHS’’). The costs of medical products assigned to classes A and H are wholly_
borne by the Italian NHS (i.e., reimbursable); some of them are refundable only in hospitals. By contrast,
the patient has to bear the costs for medicinal products in classes C and C-bis (i.e., nonreimbursable). The
class of refundability is identified during the marketing authorization procedure.

Class A includes essential products and those intended for chronic diseases (e.g., antibiotics, antidiabetic
and antitumor medicines), and are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS. To acquire these products, a valid
prescription must be obtained.

Class H includes products requiring specialist supervision that are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS if
dispensed in hospitals.

Class C includes other products that do not have the characteristics of class A or class H and are not
reimbursed by the Italian NHS. In particular, they are medicinal products used for minor diseases, which
are therefore not considered to be ‘‘essential’’ or ‘‘life-saving.’’ Class C includes prescription-only
medicinal products as well as nonprescription-only medicinal products which cannot be advertised to the
public. With Law 311/2004 (Budget Law 2005), a new range of medicinal products was established, the
C-bis class, which includes nonprescription-only medicinal products which may be advertised to the public
(OTC products).

The mechanism for determining the prices of medicinal products differs depending on whether they are
reimbursable or not. In particular, AIFA applies price regulation only to reimbursed medicines. For
non-reimbursable medicines (class C), the price is set freely by pharmaceutical companies but is monitored
by AIFA and the Ministry of Health in order to keep prices at reasonable levels. Although, in principle, the
prices of class C medicinal products are set freely by pharmaceutical companies, in practice they have been
increasingly regulated by legislative provisions according to which pharmaceutical companies may only
increase prices of class C pharmaceuticals every other January. The prices assigned by manufacturers are
maximum prices nationwide. Price reductions by manufacturers are allowed at any time, while price
increases are allowed in January of odd years. With reference to classes C and C-bis medicinal products,
however:

(i) as to medicinal products that are subject to medical prescription, AIFA carries out monitoring action
aimed at verifying compliance with two main conditions: (i) that the price of medicinal products can
be increased every two years (in odd years); and (ii) that the increase may not exceed the target
inflation rate; and

(ii) as to medicinal products that are not subject to medical prescription, the price is freely determined by
manufacturers.

With reference to classes A and H medicinal products, a specific negotiation procedure between AIFA and
pharmaceutical companies holding marketing authorizations is provided for in the applicable legislation in
order to determine the price of the relevant medicinal products. The negotiation procedure is conducted
according to the following criteria: therapeutic value, pharmacovigilance data, prices in other European
Union countries, prices of similar products within the same pharmaceutical therapeutic group, internal
market forecasts, the number of potential patients and therapeutic innovation. In order to determine the
price of medicinal products, the negotiation between AIFA and pharmaceutical companies requires
completion of a four-stage procedure:

(i) Pharmaceutical companies file with AIFA a specific reimbursement and pricing request supported by
a dossier aimed at proving: (a) a positive cost/benefit ratio (which means that the medicinal product
(x) is to be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no effective treatment, or
provides a more appropriate response in respect of products already available for the same
therapeutic indications; or (y) presents a more favorable risk/benefit ratio if compared with other
medicinal products already available); or (b) other elements of interest for the NHS, if the medicinal
product does not present a significant clinical superiority compared with to other products already
available or that it is at least as effective and safer that other products already available.

(ii) AIFA’s Technical Scientific Committee (‘‘CTS’’) provides its opinion on reimbursement by an
evaluation of the clinical therapeutic value.

150


-----

(iii) AIFA’s Pricing and Reimbursement Committee evaluates the dossier, also taking into consideration
the consumer spending data provided by the National Observatory on the Use of Medicines
(OSMED), and hears from the company as part of the negotiation.

(iv) The outcome of the negotiation is submitted to the CTS for its final opinion and then to AIFA’s
Management Board for approval.

The results of the negotiation procedure are published in the Italian Official Gazette. A price agreement
reached between AIFA and the manufacturer of the medicinal product lasts 24 months and is subject to
automatic renewal for an additional period of 24 months unless previously terminated by either party. In
the event of changes in the therapeutic indications of a medicinal product leading to a potential increase in
its use, the negotiation must be re-opened before the expiration of the agreement. It is common practice to
establish a proportionate relationship between the price paid and the volume of sales of the medicinal
product under the negotiation procedure. If there is no agreement on the price, then the medicinal product
is classified as not reimbursable and listed in class C.

As a general principle, the price of medicinal products, which includes VAT (applied at a rate of 10%),
includes the ex-factory value (which is the price of industry revenue) and the amounts due to wholesalers
and pharmacists. The pricing negotiation procedure for generics does not differ from that of other
medicines, although, based on applicable regulations, the manufacturer should guarantee at least a 20%
price reduction below the price of the originator reference medicinal product.

The Italian NHS only reimburses classes A and H medicinal products; no reimbursement is provided for
class C medicinal products.

In Italy, a reference price system (‘‘RPS’’)—which is one of the instruments used to control public
expenditure on pharmaceutical products—has been in effect since 2001.

Under the RPS, the Italian NHS reimburses the lowest price among the prices of off-patent medicinal
products made with equal composition in active ingredients, with the same pharmaceutical form, the same
method of administration, the same number of units and the same unit dosage. When patients refuse the
substitution of a medicine eligible for generic substitution and/or if the doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical
product with a price higher than the reference price and specifically provides that the said pharmaceutical
product cannot be substituted with other products, the difference is paid by the patient.

In Italy, medicinal products are traditionally distributed by pharmacies. Exceptions include a few widely
used or very expensive products, which are distributed directly by the Local Health Authorities (‘‘LHAs’’)
and by hospitals. Drug reimbursement is made by the LHAs to the pharmacies. Once a medicinal product
is authorized, it is not immediately eligible for reimbursement. As a very general principle, reimbursement
is provided for essential medicinal products, namely products: (i) for diseases for which no therapeutic
alternative exists; (ii) for which the medicinal products already available on the market do not provide a
satisfactory or appropriate answer; and (iii) which present a better cost/benefit and risk/benefit analysis
than those offered by medicinal products already on the market. Even in the absence of these
characteristics, medicinal products that are as safe and effective as those already on the market may be
reimbursable depending on the result of their cost/benefit evaluation.

When evaluating eligibility for reimbursement, AIFA also takes into consideration the following factors in
relation to the medicinal products: the sales price in other European Union member states; the therapeutic
class; the foreseen market share in the following 24 months; the impact on expenditures for the Italian
NHS; and its place in the industrial environment. To apply for reimbursement, the marketing authorization
holder must submit an application alongside documentation proving, among other things, a positive cost/
benefit ratio to demonstrate that the medicinal products is to be considered useful for the treatment of
diseases for which there is no medical care, or that it provides more adequate treatment compared to other
medicinal products already on the market.

Finally, please note that the procedural rules illustrated above and the criteria for the negotiation of the
refundability and price of medicinal products by the Italian NHS, between AIFA and the pharmaceutical
companies, will probably change in near future. More precisely, already in July 2019, the Ministry of
Health, in agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, issued a draft decree on new procedures
for negotiating the refundability and price of medicinal products. The legislative text has already received a
favorable opinion from the State—Regions Conference and is now continuing its procedure for
registration by the Court of Auditors and publication in the Official Journal of the Italian Republic.
However, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the legislation has not entered into force. This does

151


-----

not, however, mean that completely new regulations will be introduced, but only that some of the existing
rules regarding the agreement between the pharmaceutical companies and AIFA, concerning the
refundability and price of medicinal products marketed in Italy, will be subject to amendments in the
future.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Spain_**

Public reimbursement of medicinal products is tightly regulated by Spanish legislation under the equality
principle within the whole Health National System (the ‘‘HNS’’) and only applies to those prescription
medicinal products (prescribed by pharmacies, hospitals or healthcare centers) that have been previously
included in the HNS through a specific authorization granted by the state authorities. Medicines covered
by the HNS do not include OTC medicines, but do include some generics prescription. All medicines not
included in the HNS can be priced freely on the open market, subject to a notification issued to the State
Authorities.

State authorities (i.e., the Health Ministry) approve the prices and reimbursement conditions for the
authorized medicinal prescription products that apply all over the territory mainly taking into account the
characteristics of the pathologies involved, public expenditure rationalization, the impact on the public
budget, a cost-effectiveness analysis and the existence of similar medicinal products. Generally, the
maximum reimbursement price (the ‘‘Industry Price’’) will be equal to or below the price that would apply
if the corresponding medicinal products were dispensed to patients who are not beneficiaries of the HNS.
To settle the Industry Price, the pharmaceutical industry is obligated to provide to the state authorities all
the information on technical, financial and economic matters related to the relevant medicinal product.

Public reimbursement is subject to the reference price system (the ‘‘RPS’’), which is the maximum amount
that the corresponding prescribed medicinal product included in each medicinal group (with the same
active pharmaceutical ingredient and route of administration) will be public reimbursed, i.e., the RPS is a
product group pricing benchmark that will influence the Industry Price for an individual product where the
relevant product group has previously been allocated a reference price. The RPS is set by taking into
account the lowest cost/treatment/length of treatment of the medicinal products of each group. The retail
price is based on the RPS, adding wholesale and pharmacy commercial margins, respectively, which are
tightly regulated by the state authorities.

The Industry Price of a particular medicinal product represents the maximum price at which an HNS
medicine will be reimbursed at the manufacturing level. The marketing authorization holder who will
deliver into the supply chain (typically, to a wholesaler who will sell it on to a pharmacy) will therefore be
aware of the maximum price that it will collect. Wholesaler and pharmacy margins are be fixed by
legislation. The retail price equals the Industry Price plus the wholesale and pharmacy commercial
margins. Once the Industry Price is fixed, it is be updated annually by the state authorities and can be
modified if changes in financial and technical circumstances or the evaluation of their therapeutic use so
warrants.

State authorities are entitled to proceed with the necessary inspections in order to verify if the maximum
prices are being adhered to, and if they are not, state authorities can initiate penalty proceedings that may
lead to the imposition of fines and the seizure of the medicinal products affected in the case of a breach.
Pricing set in other jurisdictions cannot replace the equivalent price in Spain without a particular
resolution issued by the state authorities which establishes the price, which can be equal to or different
from the price of other jurisdictions.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Russia_**

In Russia, there are two types of reimbursement schemes:

(1) For all in-patients and emergency care (under the Federal Fund for Mandatory Medical Insurance). This
scheme covers all pharmaceutical products that a patient receives in a hospital (e.g., prescription-only
medicines and any OTC medicines). The pharmaceutical products must be included in a standard of
care developed by the Ministry of Health for the particular disorder and in the ‘‘essential drugs’’ list
(‘‘VEP’’), a list of drugs which should be made available in an in-patient setting, and which is used as
the basis for a number of out-patient reimbursement schemes (See ‘‘—Russia—Overview—VEP
_Circulation’’). In the case of an individual patient not responding to treatment with a VEP medicine or_
having an adverse reaction to a VEP, the medical panel may substitute a non-VEP medicine.

152


-----

(2) For out-patients. The out-patient reimbursement schemes include: (a) the ONLS (Population Drug
Coverage) scheme covering eligible categories of patients; (b) the VZN scheme (also referred to as
the ‘‘High-cost nosologies’’ scheme) covering patients with high-cost diseases, including
mucoviscidosis and multiple sclerosis, which are together referred to as the DLO scheme; and
(c) other schemes also covering certain groups of patients (e.g., patients suffering from orphan
diseases, children under three years of age and others).

Depending on their entitlement, out-patients are eligible to receive either free or partially subsidized
prescription medicines. In order to receive benefits, some patients (e.g., veterans and disabled persons) are
required to present authorization documents confirming their status and can obtain a wide range of drugs
for different disorders. Other patients must be included in the federal register for specified disorders and
can only obtain the medicines that are included in the list of the drugs relevant to their disorder. A
prescription is issued by a consulting physician. An out-patient can obtain necessary drugs in authorized
(state or municipal) drugstores.

The general rules of VEP pricing are described under ‘‘—Russia—Overview—VEP Circulation.’’ A VEP
drugs manufacturer can apply annually to re-register (to increase) a price under the rules set by the
government to recover the manufacturer’s operating costs. Distributors and drugstores can each apply a
mark-up that is limited by regional legislatures. Federal and regional authorities have the right to control
retail prices and pricing during procurement procedures.

All reimbursable pharmaceutical products are purchased by hospitals and authorized drugstores solely
through public procurement procedures which tender for drugs by reference to their INN (taking into
account the dosage, dosage form and other significant features of medicinal products), their compliance
with the registered price with respect to VEP (overpricing is prohibited in the case of VEP subject of
public procurement) and which give priority to medicinal products from EAEU countries in an auction.
Non-VEP product pricing is not regulated by the state. If the products subject to public procurement
procedures are not VEP, the initial maximum contract price in the context of public procurement
procedures is defined using the current market price. The Order of the Ministry of Health ‘‘On the
Approval of the Public Pharmacare Strategy in the Russian Federation till 2025 and its Implementation
Schedule’’ sets forth a new reimbursement system in Russia, to be implemented in the future. Pilot projects
have been introduced in selected regions. For example, the Kirov region has set up a co-payment scheme
whereby a patient pays only 10% of the price of cardiovascular disease medicines with the remaining 90%
being funded from the regional budget. Several other reimbursement models are under consideration,
including the introduction of a reference pricing system of interchangeable drugs under which patients, if
they choose, will be required to pay any difference between the reference price of the generic version and
the actual price of the desired original product.

In addition to the existing Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement includes
(in addition to other permissions under the limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without
double counting against the limitation on indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness
(including under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the Senior Secured Credit Facilities

of LTM EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and subject to certain
customary additions including the amount of prepayments and buy backs), plus an unlimited amount,
provided that, pro forma for the incurrence of such additional facilities or permitted alternative debt: (i) if
such indebtedness is secured on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement such that such liabilities rank pari passu with Facility F and Facility E2, the consolidated senior
secured net leverage ratio (as described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) does not exceed 5.00:1; or

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires mandatory prepayment in full or in part in

proceeds to be prepaid subject to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) (a ‘‘Listing Prepayment’’);

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the Senior Secured Group from certain asset disposals, to
the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of
the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount; and

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, for each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing
Date), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum
threshold amount (subject to certain adjustments based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be
paid to non-controlling shareholders and certain other expenses), which percentage decreases as the
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio decreases (an ‘‘Excess Cash Flow Prepayment’’).

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement), each lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a prescribed
time period. A change of control shall include:

- any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the

a percentage of the issued share capital of STADA (excluding treasury shares) at least equal to 60% of
such total issued share capital;

- following certain potential mergers of STADA permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer ceasing to (directly or indirectly) own a percentage of the
issued share capital of German Holdco at least equal to 60% of such total issued share capital; and

- on a disposal of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Group (as defined below).

At the election of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing

-----

Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the
‘‘Revolving Test Condition’’), the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 8.75 to 1.00. The

pro forma EBITDA does not exceed an agreed ratio; (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer having a
long-term corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor Services

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as
under the Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for additional
events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) breach of
the financial covenant, provided that, in the event of such breach, only a majority of the Lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility shall initially be entitled to take enforcement action; (ii) inaccuracy of a
representation or statement when made; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Credit Facilities
financing documents; and (iv) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with
English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related
definitions scheduled to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance

Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into additional facility notices in respect of Facility F (EUR) and
Facility F (GBP), and on February 12, 2020, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into an amendment
and restatement agreement in respect of Facility E, pursuant to which the Senior Term Facilities
Amendment, the Facility E2 Amendment and the Facility D Repricing took effect. Facility F (EUR) and
Facility F (GBP) were established on substantially the same terms as Facility C (EUR) and Facility C
(GBP) save for, subject to certain conditions, the termination date was extended up to August 2026 (with a
springing maturity to June 2025 in case the Senior Notes remain outstanding at that date at their current
maturity, or to the extent that the maturity of the Senior Notes is extended to a date between September
2025 and August 2026, as would fall three months prior to such new maturity date) and, in respect of
Facility D only, save as to the proposed decrease in margin. The Facility E2 Amendment amended and
restated Facility E as ‘‘Facility E2’’, in order to give effect to the same amendment regarding termination
date as Facility F (EUR) and Facility F (GBP) gave effect to. Facility B1 (EUR), Facility B2, Facility C
(EUR), Facility C (GBP) and Facility D were refinanced in full on a cashless basis from the proceeds of

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, the Trustee are
party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

By accepting an Additional Note, holders of the Additional Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it,
are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law and
sets out various matters governing the relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative
ranking of certain debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or
Third-party Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the
Debtors or Third-party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt,
the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document

below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their
debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements
(in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is
(without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not
permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the
Topco Finance Documents; (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for
restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate

Documents); (F) of any other amount not exceeding A2,500,000 in any twelve month period; (G) of
any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding)
which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that
amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco
Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such
payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities
or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment; (H) for as long as an
event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group

Secured Notes Issuer (a ‘‘Debt for Equity Swap’’) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is
made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in
any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a
member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the
Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that arise
as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and

Documents; (K) if the payment is made by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the
Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of
the Senior Secured Group or such payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower
from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents unless the Topco
Borrower is a guarantor or borrower of any prior ranking debt facilities at such time and any such
prior ranking debt facility has been accelerated or an Insolvency Event has occurred; (L) if the
payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a
Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a
single lender in the event of a tax gross up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable; and
(M) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the

than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of
first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be)) of the applicable Topco Liabilities; or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give
prior consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third-party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the
occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a ‘‘Senior Secured Event of
Default’’) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a ‘‘Second Lien Event of Default’’), the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured
Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
‘‘Topco Payment Stop Notice’’) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the ‘‘Topco Agent’’) and the trustee
under any Topco Notes (the ‘‘Topco Notes Trustee’’) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or
Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the
Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expiries;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant
stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco
Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Enforcement Regime—Permitted Topco Enforcement’’ below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant
event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure
to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an enforcement
notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group
Liabilities (a ‘‘Topco Enforcement Notice’’) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

174


-----

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and
capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that
has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the ‘‘Topco
Investors’’) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be deemed waived without any further action being required on part of the
Topco Creditors or relevant Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only).

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest
to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the
‘‘Topco Discharge Date’’) (the ‘‘Final Discharge Date’’) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor
on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third-party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off (pursuant to the applicable terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) which
does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an Acceleration
Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (a ‘‘Distress Event’’), or (II) as a result of any
other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any
Third-party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a Distress
Event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below
under _‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’; and in the case of Intra Group Liabilities, any amount received or_
recovered in accordance with the provisions relating to Intra Group Liabilities in the Intercreditor
Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered notwithstanding that an Acceleration
Event is continuing);

175


-----

(i) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’; or

(ii) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security
Provider which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of
_Proceeds’’ and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined_
below) in respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security
Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered)
on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any)
by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers
from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider (x) any
proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following a
Distress Event, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property (collectively, ‘‘Enforcement
Proceeds’’) or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security
Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

‘‘Insolvency Event’’ is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement) or Third-party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or
making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization,
(b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other
than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a result of any financial difficulty on the part of that
Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third-party Security Provider, (c) a moratorium is declared in relation to
any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any
analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), (i) frivolous or vexatious
proceedings and which, if capable of remedy, are discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20 business days of
commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised (or such other period agreed between the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Instructing Group (as defined below)), (ii) (in the case of any
application to appoint and administrator or commence, proceedings) which the Security Agent is satisfied
(acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group) will be withdrawn before it is heard or will be
unsuccessful and (iii) as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a
Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party to the
Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material
Subsidiary or Third-party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the
Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the
person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities
owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions
paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case
of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute

176


-----

Enforcement Proceeds) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such
set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that
set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application
_of Proceeds’’ below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands,
collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Senior Secured Group or
Third-party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests
in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction
Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security (as applicable) unless instructed otherwise by an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise
as specified in the provisions described below.

An ‘‘Instructing Group’’ means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined
below);

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco
Creditors (as defined below); and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Super Senior Discharge Date’’),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of
the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the ‘‘Majority Senior
Secured Creditors’’), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super
Senior Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) save that, in each case for instructions
relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions
in accordance with the enforcement regime described under ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction
_Security Prior to the Designation Date’’ and ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the_
_Designation Date’’ below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of
the Second Lien Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Second Lien Creditors’’); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Topco Creditors’’).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce
or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to

177


-----

enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or
have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor
or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) where the rights of the Topco Creditors to
enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may
give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the
Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or
representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to
give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions
received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good
faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before
giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the
agent(s) of the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other
agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement
relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten business days or take any Enforcement Action
(the ‘‘Consultation Period’’) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give the enforcement
instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the
Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those
instructions (an ‘‘Initial Enforcement Notice’’) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement
they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or
the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the
Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency
Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a
Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the
method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds
and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the
Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date
and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to
enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the ‘‘Second Lien
Agent’’) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second
Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority
Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the
Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third-party Security

178


-----

Provider to make a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such
instruction or indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions
as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction
Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

‘‘Enforcement Principles’’ means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement
chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received
in cash and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over A5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a
public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion
from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as
any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising
under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the
paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure including any

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under ‘‘—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors’’ will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security
securing the Topco Group Liabilities, if:

Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in
relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any

for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus
certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to

**_Distressed Disposals_**

‘‘Distressed Disposal’’ means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a

Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), or (c) after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by a

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the

without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor
Agreement, Third-party Security Provider or Debtor):

assets (and each Debtor and Third-party Security Provider which transfers title of or assigned any of
its assets located in Germany under any document governing Transaction Security (or at the time of its
accession) will accept any re transfer or re assignment of that asset by the Security Agent and will
undertake to procure the acceptance of such re transfer or re assignment by its subsidiaries), and

Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the
relevant creditors and Debtors;

its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding
company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets (and each Debtor and Thirdparty Security Provider which transfers title of or assigned any of its assets located in Germany under

transfer or re assignment of that asset by the Security Agent and will undertake to procure the
acceptance of such re transfer or re assignment by its subsidiaries) and (C) any other claim of an Intra
Group Lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities (the ‘‘Transferee’’) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

183


-----

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part
only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third-party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the ‘‘Disposed Entity’’) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the ‘‘Receiving Entity’’) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the Intra Group Liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or liabilities to
any Debtor on behalf of the relevant Intra Group Lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities)
to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities,
liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set
out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of
the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of
liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing
market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or Unsecured Liabilities would otherwise be
released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those
borrowing liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in which case
the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or
Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being
effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares
in a borrower or issuer of, or over assets of a borrower or issuer of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco

184


-----

Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release
that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, trustee of the Second Lien Notes, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or
Topco Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other
marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially
in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance
with the provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Parties (other than in relation to performance bonds, guarantees or
similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of the Senior Secured
Group) against a member of the Senior Secured Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than
any minority interest not owned by members of the Senior Secured Group) are pledged in favor
of the Priority Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security, Topco
Independent Transaction Security or other security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of
the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and
discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such
claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(i) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and
any senior secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged but

the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(ii) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent
and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the

Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively) and (ii) serve a notice on the Security
Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer
may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an
appropriate mechanic the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities
(as applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent
of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(i) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with the
advice of a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party
professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

(ii) where a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has delivered an

187


-----

respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or

Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only

materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from
the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required (or in the case of the hedge
counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty).

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ above and the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of
(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the

any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge
counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions
or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized
to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its
capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
may, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party and the prior consent of the
Secured Parties is required to authorize any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any
document creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets
subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without
limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement)
may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents’’ are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in_
particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or
consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under

amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents
relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Security Agent.

188


-----

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action
or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
creditor fails to respond to the request within ten business days (or any other period of time notified by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter
period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be
deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant
confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an ‘‘IPO’’), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all
related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the
‘‘IPO Pushdown Entity,’’ and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such
IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer which is
the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio

**2022 Notes**

In 2015, STADA Arzneimittel AG issued A300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured
notes (the ‘‘2022 Notes’’). The 2022 Notes mature on April 8, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of
1.75% per annum. The 2022 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of STADA, ranking pari passu among
themselves. The net proceeds of the 2022 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. STADA may
redeem the 2022 Notes in the event of certain adverse changes in taxation. The terms and conditions
governing the 2022 Notes provide for customary events of default and change of control provisions and a
customary negative pledge clause which limits the ability of STADA and its material subsidiaries to incur
liens on their respective assets to secure certain other indebtedness, without simultaneously securing the
2022 Notes on an equal and ratable basis. The 2022 Notes are governed by German law and listed on the
official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the regulated market thereof.
As of December 31, 2019, A267.4 million was outstanding under the 2022 Notes.

The grant of security interests by German Holdco, STADA and the other Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities has resulted in a
default under the 2022 Notes, which entitles individual holders of the 2022 Notes to demand repayment at
a price of par plus accrued interest.

**Promissory Notes**

As of December 31, 2019, an amount of (i) A 41.5 million was outstanding under a first tranche of senior
unsecured promissory notes (Schuldscheindarlehen), which would need to be repaid in full in April 2021;
and (ii) A7 million was outstanding under a second tranche of Schuldscheindarlehen, which would need to
be repaid in full in April 2023.

**Local Credit Lines**

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’_
_under the heading ‘‘Certain Definitions’’ below. For purposes of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’_
_references to the ‘‘Issuer,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer only to Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH and not to any_
_of its Subsidiaries._

The following is a description of the A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured
Notes due 2024 (the ‘‘New Notes’’). The New Notes will be issued by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH
(formerly, Nidda Healthcare Holding AG) (the ‘‘Issuer’’) under the indenture dated as of September 29,
2017 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Indenture’’) between,
_inter alios, the Issuer, the guarantors named therein, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such_
capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’) and as security agent (in such capacity, the ‘‘Security Agent’’), and Elavon Financial
Services DAC, UK Branch, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See ‘‘Notice to Certain Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture has not been qualified under, and does not incorporate by reference or include,
nor is it subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof.
Consequently, the Holders are not entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to
holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring
the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain
relationships between it and us.

The terms of the New Notes include those set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Pursuant to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer previously issued (i) A735.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘Original Senior Secured Notes’’) on September 29, 2017 (the
‘‘Original Issue Date’’), (ii) A350,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes on
February 13, 2020 and (iii) A600,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3[1]⁄2% Senior Secured Notes on
March 3, 2020 ((i) through (iii), collectively, the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured Notes’’). The New Notes will
constitute Additional Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), will have the same terms and conditions as
the Existing Senior Secured Notes (other than issue price) and will constitute a single class of securities
with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions, and offers to purchase. However, the
New Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and will be issued with separate ISINs and common codes from those assigned to the Existing
Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—
_No Fungibility with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes.’’_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which A200.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be issued in connection with this Offering. We
may, subject to applicable law and the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, issue an unlimited
principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes having identical terms and conditions (other than the
issue price) as the Senior Secured Notes (any such additional Senior Secured Notes actually issued, the
‘‘Additional Senior Secured Notes’’); _provided that if any series of Additional Senior Secured Notes is not_
fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Existing Senior Secured Notes or Additional Notes
(as applicable), such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common
code from those assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes or Additional Notes, as applicable. We will
only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the Incurrence of Liens. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,_
the Senior Secured Notes, and if issued, Additional Senior Secured Notes, will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’ include the Existing
Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes (including the New Notes, if any) that are
actually issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to

193

understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of
the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain
indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents for complete
descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents will be available
from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without
limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have
not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are, or will be, subject to certain transfer
restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes:

- are, or will be, general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’;

- rank, or will rank, _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the_
Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including obligations
of the Issuer under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations);

- rank, or will rank, senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that
is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Senior Notes
Guarantees;

- are, or will be, effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured
Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness;

- are, or will be, structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of
the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including their obligations to their trade creditors;

- are, or will be, guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis;

- are, or will be, secured by the Collateral (as defined below);

- will mature on September 30, 2024; and

- are, or will be, represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in
certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined
below). See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations; provided, however, that
the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a ‘‘super senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of
the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior hedging obligations) have been
paid in full. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

The Issuer is a holding company incorporated for the purposes of the STADA Acquisition, and the Issuer’s
only material assets consist of its indirect interests in its Subsidiaries. All of the operations of the Issuer are
conducted through its Subsidiaries. Therefore, the Issuer depends on the receipt of funds from its

194


-----

Subsidiaries (whether in the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with
respect to intercompany obligations) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes are, or will be, structurally subordinated in right of payment to
all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of
the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of December 31, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and certain other transactions as
described under ‘‘Capitalization,’’ the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had
A4,956.7 million of Indebtedness secured with a first-priority Lien on the Collateral, consisting of
A2,677.2 million of drawings under the Senior Term Loan Facilities, A394.5 million of drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility (excluding A5.5 million of letters of credit issued in respect of trade obligations),
A1,685.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior Secured Notes and A200.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of New Notes, in addition to A356.0 million of STADA Existing Debt. On a pro
forma basis as of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility was fully drawn.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes are, or will be, guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis. In
addition, if required by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ certain
other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the
future.

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor:

- is, or will be, a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’;

- ranks, or will rank, _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that_
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of
that Guarantor (including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
obligations);

- ranks, or will rank, senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including the Senior
Notes Guarantees;

- is, or will be, effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior
Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and
assets securing such indebtedness; and

- is, or will be, structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of
that Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee are, or will be, as applicable,
limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantee from constituting a
fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect
limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be further limited
as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under ‘‘Senior Secured Notes
_Guarantees—General.’’ By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured_
Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—The insolvency laws of
_Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United_
_States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Senior Secured_
_Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect_
_their validity and enforceability.’’ The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_
and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.’’_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

In this Offering, the Issuer will issue A200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes. The

Notes (including the New Notes) will be issued in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral
multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. While the Senior Secured Notes may only be traded in
denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, for the purpose of the
International Central Securities Depositories (‘‘ICSDs’’), the minimum denomination will be considered to
be A1. For the avoidance of doubt, the ICSDs are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum
amount.

The Senior Secured Notes (together with any Additional Senior Secured Notes) will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including in respect of any amendment,
waiver or other modification of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any other action by the Holders
hereunder, except as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1%
higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

**_Interest on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes accrues, or will accrue, at the rate of 3.50% per annum. Interest on
the Senior Secured Notes is, or will be, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 30 and September 30.
Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is, or will be, payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured
Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes (other than the New Notes) will accrue from the date of original
issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest on the New
Notes will accrue from March 30, 2020. Interest is, or will be, computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any
Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day
at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payment on such
Senior Secured Notes will be subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Payments of principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the
Senior Secured Notes will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or
its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (‘‘Definitive
_Registered Senior Secured Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying_
Agents maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address
of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured Notes for the
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes’’
below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes in London, United
Kingdom (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent is Elavon Financial Services DAC,

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The
initial Registrar is Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent is Elavon Financial

196


-----

Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior
Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate
transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Senior Secured Notes shall
be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Senior Secured
Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the
Issuer shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. However,
for so long as Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange
(the ‘‘Exchange’’) and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify
the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes are, or will be, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. Each
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is a full and unconditional Guarantee of the Issuer’s obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, subject to the contractual limitations discussed below. In addition, as described
under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’ and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Senior Facilities in the
future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into
a supplemental senior secured notes indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by
general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit
rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title
claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is, or will be, limited to the maximum amount that would not
render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required
under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws.
By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital_
_maintenance and other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes_
_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the_
_Senior Secured Notes Collateral’’ and ‘‘—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions_
_may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with_
_which you are familiar; other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests,_
_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.’’_

A portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to
become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted
over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles, such as those Subsidiaries organized in
Russia, Serbia and Vietnam. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade
creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries
of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the
Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of
non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accounted for 19.1% of the
consolidated sales and 44.2% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group. In addition, as of
December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accounted for 51.8% of the consolidated assets
of the Target Group. As of December 31, 2019, after giving _pro forma effect to the Offering and certain_
other transactions as described under ‘‘Capitalization,’’ the Issuer’s Subsidiaries organized in Russia, Serbia
and Argentina would have had third-party financial indebtedness (excluding finance leases) of
A258.3 million, A36.3 million and A3.8 million, respectively. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
limits the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and Preferred
Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted
Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and
_‘‘Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.’’_

**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

- upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction
_and Discharge’’;_

- pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

- as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees’’;_

- upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes;
or

- as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘Merger and Consolidation.’’

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, including the
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or
consent on the part of the Trustee.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees in respect thereof have been, or will
be, secured on a first-priority basis by Security Interests in:

- a pledge of the shares in the Issuer, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables
owed by the Issuer to the Company and a pledge of the material bank accounts of the Issuer;

- a pledge of the shares in German Holdco, a security assignment of any structural intercompany
receivables owed by German Holdco to the Issuer and a pledge of the material bank accounts of
German Holdco;

198


-----

- a pledge of the shares in STADA acquired by the Issuer or German Holdco and a security assignment
of any structural intercompany receivables owed by any material company to the Issuer or German
Holdco;

- a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by any material
subsidiary (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and

- pledges of the shares in each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U. and
material bank accounts of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor,

(collectively, and together with any and all other assets from time to time in which a Security Interest has
been or will be granted pursuant to any Senior Secured Security Document to secure the obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and/or any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee, the ‘‘Collateral’’).

The Collateral also secures the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations on a first-priority basis.
The Senior Notes are secured on a second-priority basis by Security Interests in a pledge of the shares in
the Issuer and a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the Issuer to the
Company. The Security Interests in the Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent on
behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Senior Secured Security Documents. On the
New Issue Date, the Security Interests in the Collateral will be reaffirmed pursuant to customary
confirmation agreements in favor of or granted under Senior Secured Notes Security Documents and, as a
result, will extend to the liabilities under the New Notes.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Issuer and_
the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future
issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain
requirements described herein, Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may be
re-designated as a ‘‘super senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such
re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the
obligations thereunder (and certain super senior hedging obligations) have been paid in full. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—
_Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

The Collateral has been pledged pursuant to the Senior Secured Security Documents to the Security Agent
on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral.
Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
would also constitute ‘‘Collateral.’’ All Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior
_Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge_
over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, ‘‘transfer pricing,’’ ‘‘thin capitalization,’’ ‘‘earnings
stripping,’’ ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’ and other tax restrictions, ‘‘exchange control
restrictions,’’ ‘‘capital maintenance’’ rules and ‘‘liquidity impairment’’ rules, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the

199


-----

Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘‘Group’’) to provide a guarantee or security or
may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the
guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security
Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the
Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact
on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or
security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility,
stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the
relevant guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection
and/or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties
of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract,
lease, license, instrument or other third-party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset
from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring
a consent of any third-party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which,
if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third-party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in
respect of the asset or require the relevant charger to take any action materially adverse to the
interests of the Group or any member thereof; _provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a_
specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be
used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession
document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve
placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within
the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or
statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual
prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal
liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, _provided that, to the extent_
requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession
document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security
Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security
documents for all the secured creditors); _provided that it shall be permissible to use ‘‘parallel debt’’_
provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the
individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no member of the Group shall
be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or
transfer of the Senior Secured Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent, and the agreement that where a class of assets to be
secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial
assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material
assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a thirdparty or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be
excluded from any relevant security document);

- the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of
assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or
sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security will not be

200


-----

required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or
any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group;

- that agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending,
waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to
an Event of Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the Agreed
Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject
to the Agreed Security Principles; and

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or
other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or in
Russia, Serbia or Vietnam (the ‘‘Excluded Jurisdictions’’) or otherwise over the shares of a member of
the Group located in an Excluded Jurisdiction.

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Senior Facilities as well as
certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Senior Secured Notes and may also secure certain future
Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the Holders.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with any offering of Senior Secured Notes.
By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—The value of the Senior_
_Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_
_under the Senior Secured Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.’’_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Senior
Secured Security Documents (the ‘‘Security Interests’’ and each, a ‘‘Security Interest’’) as between (a) the
lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee,
the security agent and the holders of the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indentures and (e) the
creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future)
permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, has been established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, which provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior
Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by
first-ranking Security Interests. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a ‘‘super
senior’’ obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain
super senior hedging obligations) have been paid in full. The obligations under the Senior Notes
Guarantees shall rank in right of priority and payment after liabilities owed, among others, under the
Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Senior Secured Notes, and
obligations under the Senior Notes Guarantees will be postponed and subordinated to, among others,
obligations under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

**_Senior Secured Security Documents_**

Under the Senior Secured Security Documents, the Issuer, the Company and the Guarantors have granted
security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such
Senior Secured Security Documents, the Security Agent acts in its own name, but for the benefit of the
secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time).
Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the

201


-----

Senior Notes, the Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to
the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. On the New Issue Date, the Security Interests in the
Collateral will be reaffirmed pursuant to customary confirmation agreements in favor of or granted under
Senior Secured Notes Security Documents and, as a result, will extend to the liabilities under the New
Notes.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
Security Interests, the relevant Senior Secured Security Documents secures, or will secure, ‘‘parallel debt’’
obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt
construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—The security interests in the Senior Secured_
_Notes Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_
_Senior Secured Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be_
_restricted by local law.’’_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Senior Secured
Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual
provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except
through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral (as
applicable).

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Senior Secured
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been discharged. However,
the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
may be released under certain circumstances as provided under ‘‘—Release of Liens.’’

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Senior Secured Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Senior Secured Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—The granting of the Senior_
_Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, or_
_the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_
_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.’’_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or
the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by
the Senior Secured Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.’’ The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to_
future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder is deemed to have,
appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Security Documents securing such Indebtedness.

202


-----

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Secured Note, is
deemed (without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Senior Secured Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents securing
such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Senior Secured Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Senior Secured Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the
Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—
_The security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent_
_rather than directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the_
_Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of
the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and is otherwise not prohibited by the Senior_
Secured Notes Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise
become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as
provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; or

(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Senior Secured Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may
be permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior

203


-----

Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Senior Secured Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is
required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and
rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release
complies with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes have been, or will be, issued in the form of several registered notes in global
form without interest coupons attached, as follows:

- the Existing Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act are, and the New Notes sold within the United States
to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be,
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
‘‘Existing 144A Global Notes’’ and the ‘‘New 144A Global Notes,’’ respectively, and together, the ‘‘144A
_Global Notes’’). The Existing 144A Global Notes were, on the Original Issue Date, and the New 144A_
Global Notes will be, on the New Issue Date, deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Because the New
Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the New 144A Global Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN and common code from
those assigned to the Existing 144A Global Notes; and

- the Existing Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act are, and the New Notes sold outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be, represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Existing
_Regulation S Global Notes’’ and the ‘‘New Regulation S Global Notes,’’ respectively, and, together, the_
‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The
Existing Regulation S Global Notes were, on the Original Issue Date, and the New Regulation S
Global Notes will be, on the New Issue Date, deposited with and registered in the name of name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Because the
New Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the New Regulation S Global Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN and common code
from those assigned to the Existing Regulation S Notes.

During the 40-day ‘‘distribution compliance period’’ (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S
under the Securities Act), which will commence on the New Issue Date, Book-Entry Interests (as defined
below) in the New Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred only to non-U.S. Persons under
Regulation S or to persons whom the transferor reasonably believes are ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’
within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and any applicable securities
laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’ and
‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ for restrictions on the transfer of the Additional Notes.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) is, or will be, limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Transfer
_Restrictions.’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes denominated in the same currency only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes

Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after
such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum
denominations of A100,000, and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant
Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture requires the transferring or exchanging Holder
to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information
regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such
transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in
connection with such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will
be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On both the Original Issue Date and the date of this offering memorandum, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries
are Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer is permitted to designate Restricted_
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Proceeds Loan**

On August 21, 2017, the Company, as lender, and the Issuer, as borrower, entered into a loan agreement
pursuant to which the Company, as lender, loaned to the Issuer, as borrower, the gross proceeds of the
2017 Senior Notes (the ‘‘Original Proceeds Loan’’). On November 27, 2018, the Company, as lender, and
the Issuer, as borrower, entered into a new proceeds loan agreement under which the proceeds of the 2018
Senior Notes were loaned to the Issuer (the ‘‘2018 Proceeds Loan’’ and, together with the Original
Proceeds Loan, the ‘‘Proceeds Loans’’).

The Proceeds Loans are denominated in Euros in a principal amount equal to the net proceeds of the
applicable series of Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan Agreement requires the Issuer to make all payments
thereunder on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Company can satisfy its payment obligations under
the Senior Notes, including as to interest, principal, additional amounts, if any, and other required
payments due under the Senior Notes. All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loan Agreement are
payable to such account or accounts with such person or persons as the Company may designate. The
maturity date of the Proceeds Loan is the same maturity date as the maturity date of the Senior Notes. The
Proceeds Loan is an unsecured obligation of the Issuer, and is contractually subordinated to the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities pursuant to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement. The receivables under the Proceeds Loan have been assigned by way of
security, on a first-ranking basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of Holders and the Senior Facilities
and certain Hedging Obligations, and, on a second ranking basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of
holders of the Senior Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ the Senior
Secured Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to September 30, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in
part, at its option, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option, during each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon giving notice as described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to
but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem
Senior Secured Notes, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ with the Net Cash Proceeds
received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 103.500% of the principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
(including any Additional Senior Secured Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture remains
outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Senior Secured Notes held by the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries).

At any time and from time to time on or after September 30, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Senior
Secured Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption
price equal to the percentage of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed set forth
below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding,
the applicable redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on September 30, of the year indicated below:

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes, including
a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of
Senior Secured Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding
Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer
and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the
Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party
will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding
in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder
(excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in
the open market or otherwise.

206


-----

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘Selection and Notice’’ below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to
purchase Senior Secured Notes as described under ‘‘Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’_

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent
or Registrar will select the Senior Secured Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of
the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed, as certified to the
Paying Agent or Registrar by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and
Clearstream, or if the Senior Secured Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of
selection and the Senior Secured Notes are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and
Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior
Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided,_
_however, that no Senior Secured Note of A100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed_
in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples of A1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the
Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a
related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than 60 days after the date
the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or
purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall
not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the
Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to
the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to
the Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will
notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case
a portion of the original Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Senior Secured Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any
conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed
for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

207


-----

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case
of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and
such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such
Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Original Issue Date
(or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the
Original Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after
such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and
(b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor
Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a
written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing
authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

208


-----

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including
(without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will
pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or
deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less
than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured
Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place
of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of
such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under such Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any
such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner
or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each
case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured
Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Senior
Secured Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable
payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder
(except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior
Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code, in each case, as of the Original Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof
or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that
the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

209


-----

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the
Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be
made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior
Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment,
the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment
date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate
as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee,

(5) such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to
any Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, or
any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a
transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this offering).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any
jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment
under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or
on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless
(i) a third-party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase
all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to A100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of A1,000 in
excess thereof; _provided that Senior Secured Notes of_ A100,000 or less in principal amount may only be
redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’)
at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such
Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at

210


-----

the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes
for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than
30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as
described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action
letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in
the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering
Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities
lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of
Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a
Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore,
sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of
Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial
purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under
‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such
restrictions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain any covenants
or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third-party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable
to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding
Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under
‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition
precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event.

211


-----

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to
the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of
Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by
the covenants below.

**_Acknowledgment of Control Limitations_**

The Control Date occurred on March 20, 2018. Prior to the Control Date: (a) to the extent the Issuer
undertakes under the Senior Secured Notes Documents to procure compliance by members of the Target
Group with any term of any Senior Secured Notes Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
respect of the covenant described under the heading ‘‘—Reports’’) or where any term of any Senior
Secured Notes Document is expressed directly or indirectly to apply to a member of the Target Group,
such term, undertaking or requirement was subject to all limitations and restrictions on the influence the
Issuer may exercise as an indirect shareholder of the Target (or the access it has to the relevant information
in its capacity as shareholder of German Holdco, as applicable) in accordance with mandatory German
corporate law but without any obligation to compensate or to offer any compensation in accordance with
the German Stock Corporation Act (including, but not limited to, Sections 311 et seq. German Stock
Corporation Act) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no breach of any such term, undertaking or
requirement, and no Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred if having exercised all such influence,
the relevant term, undertaking or requirement is nevertheless breached); and (b) any undertaking given
directly by a member of the Target Group only applied in respect of such member of the Target Group and
its Subsidiaries and shall have been given towards the Trustee and/or the Security Agent only.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture,

(c) then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

  - ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

  - ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

  - ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

  - ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

  - ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’;

  - ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’; and

212


-----

  - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer.’’

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended
Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the ‘‘Reversion
_Date’’) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including in_
connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture), unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain
Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such
time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); _provided, however, that no_
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes
Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions
taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events
would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period.
The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to
as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any
Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Term Loan Facility B or the Revolving Credit Facility) will be
deemed to have been outstanding on the Original Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date,
all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11)
of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as
Restricted Payments (as defined below) under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ will be made as
though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the
Original Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments
made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess
Proceeds (as defined below) shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Original Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of
the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first
paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes
effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Original Issue Date, so that it
is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into
during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted
during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released. All
such further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion
Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade
Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to
have any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if
the Senior Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although
such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; _provided,_ _however, that the Issuer and any of the_
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer may
issue Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of

213


-----

such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds
thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to
1.00; _provided that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and the amount of Disqualified Stock or_
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the foregoing shall not cause the Non Guarantor Debt Cap to be
exceeded.

(collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

clause (b) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
under this subclause (c) on such date of determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date); plus

(d) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (and assuming for the purpose of such calculation that
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is no less than an amount equal to the greater of the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio as of such date of determination and 5.00:1.00) the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 5.70 to 1.00 (with
any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (b) above on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (d) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date),

_provided that (i) any Indebtedness Incurred and outstanding pursuant to subclauses (a), (b) or (c) above_
shall be deemed to be Senior Secured Indebtedness, whether or not so secured, solely for purposes of
calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for subclause (c) and (ii) any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing does
not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a
refinancing of Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan Facility B or the Revolving Credit Facility, such
Indebtedness shall be treated for all purposes as Incurred pursuant to subclause (1)(a)(i) and (1)(a)(ii),
respectively; _provided further that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and Disqualified Stock or_
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to clauses (1)(b), (1)(c) and (1)(d) shall not cause the Non-Guarantor
Debt Cap to be exceeded;

(2) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

than any Additional Senior Secured Notes (including the New Notes)), including any Guarantee

a Parent Entity that are lent to the Issuer, to the extent that such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, and such Guarantees or the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, as the case may
be, as are not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (c) any Indebtedness of the Target
Group (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1) and (3) above) outstanding on the

paragraph (5) is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) A75.0 million and
(ii) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, plus (b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to
the extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation and without giving effect
to any Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to subclause (5)(a) above on the date of
determination, either: (i) the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least A1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph or clause 1(d) of the second paragraph of this covenant
and, if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at
least A1.00 of additional Senior Secured Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher, and, if such Indebtedness is Senior
Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item
of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the

that the Issuer would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant

shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness Incurred;

217


-----

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to ‘‘cash sweep’’ or
‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,

(6) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(9) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens,’’ the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including without
limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of
clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings
thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit
facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been
borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing
thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
‘‘Reserved Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if
any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the
date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each
case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition or (y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Issuer, be (a) the date
that a definitive agreement for such acquisition or Change of Control is entered into and the Fixed

218


-----

Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition,
Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; _provided that if the Issuer elects to have_
such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, (i) any such transaction
shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement is entered into and to be
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of
such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such
acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such
baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or
the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any
calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or
making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until
it has been consummated or (b) the date such Indebtedness is Incurred or assumed or such Change of
Control occurs;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with
such refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification
of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this ‘‘Limitation on
_Indebtedness.’’_

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower
Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; _provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to_
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to
have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
(a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other

219


-----

costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection
with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value
of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash
Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer
acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any
Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the
Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will
not be deemed to be a ‘‘direct or indirect’’ action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of the Company, limited in all respects to those of its
assets constituting Collateral), whether owned on the Original Issue Date or acquired after that date, or
any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the ‘‘Initial Lien’’), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,
(1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured

226


-----

Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are directly secured
equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the
case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture under (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Senior Secured
Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities),
(b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Original Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Secured Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the 2017
Senior Notes Indenture, the Guarantees of the 2017 Senior Notes or the security documents in respect
of the 2017 Senior Notes;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered
into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined_
below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall

227


-----

be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes
the Successor Issuer;

(5) any encumbrance, restriction or condition:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other
agreement to which the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; _provided that such agreement_
prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose
encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction)
pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such
Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Original Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
(A) the Senior Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, together with the Senior Secured
Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in
effect on the Original Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Issuer determines
at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on
the Senior Secured Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance
of a default relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

228


-----

(14) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Liens’’; or_

(15) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of
this paragraph or this clause (15); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with_
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of
(a) A50.0 million and (b) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by
the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under
any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; _provided_
_further that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or_
purchase any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has
extended such offer to the Holders on at least a _pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in_
respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their
Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be
deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered
under this paragraph (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds; or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be
treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with
the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy
such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the
event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such
amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture.

229


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash
of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent
necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial
assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or
(y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result
in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such
Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On the 361st day (or such longer
period permitted by clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset
Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture exceeds A50.0 million in a single transaction, the Issuer will within 10
Business Days be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of Senior Secured
Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders
of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer
price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than)
100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of
A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset
Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each
Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified
purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later
than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations
with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer
with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 360 days (or such longer
period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in
any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or
lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds
among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro
rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness provided that the Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Secured Notes or
other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset
Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion into Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor)

230


-----

and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or
other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Original Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of (a) A100.0 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements
to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured
Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or
could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes. In
such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Senior Secured Notes would constitute a Default under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction
or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(i) A37.5 million and (ii) 7.5% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) A75.0 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) above if
such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ or any Permitted Investment;

231


-----

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
and (b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, _provided that such Parent_
Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and
the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise
permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any
Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding,
any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Original Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to
time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to
the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization
Financing or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables
Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables
Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity which would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of
such Person is also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer
(provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer or such direct or
indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred
Stock) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding and the granting of registration and other customary rights (and the
performance of the related obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to
any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as

232


-----

applicable; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified,
will continue to satisfy the requirements described in the definition of ‘‘Subordinated Shareholder
_Funding’’;_

(11) (a) any payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly
or indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of annual management, consulting,
monitoring, refinancing, transaction, subsequent transaction exit fees, advisory fees and related costs
and reasonable expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith and any termination fees (including
any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including
an Initial Public Offering) and (b) any customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Entity) for
financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment
banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which are in the case of
each of clauses (a) and (b) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good
faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out of pocket expenses incurred by such Permitted Holder in
connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(13) the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and other
professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions;

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under
the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the Original Issue Date, and any similar
agreement that it may enter into thereafter; _provided, however, that the existence of, or the_
performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment
to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Original Issue
Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or
new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material
respect as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

(16) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by
Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates are
on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates;

(17) any (a) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (and
payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in connection therewith) so
long as the Investment is being offered by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary generally to other
non-affiliated third-party investors on the same or more favorable terms; (b) payments to Affiliates in
respect of securities of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries contemplated in the foregoing
clause (17)(a) or that were acquired from Persons other than the Issuer and the Restricted

its Subsidiaries or any of its Parent Entities pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option
plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement or any stock subscription or
shareholder agreement; and any employment agreements, stock option plans and other compensatory

connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted

(27) any Permitted Tax Restructuring.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a Default. If a
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation
and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted
Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would
be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such
date under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Issuer will be in default of
such covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted
under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (5) of
the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause),
calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such

234


-----

designation. Any such designation by the Issuer or the re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a
Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of such
designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following
reports following the Original Issue Date:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, and within 120 days
after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31,
2017, annual reports containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end
of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash
flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such
financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iii) unaudited _pro_
_forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory_
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations (other than an Acquisition)
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such
annual report relates (unless such _pro forma information has been provided in a previous report_
pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); _provided that such_ _pro forma financial information will be_
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of
the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a
description of all material debt instruments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may
be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017, 90 days) following the
end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with the quarter
ended September 30, 2017, quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i) the
Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending
on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet_
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial information
will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer
will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Issuer; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for
so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are
not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or
financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier

235


-----

periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for
any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s _pro forma consolidated_
revenue or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of
the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
‘‘Reports’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if
filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications,
exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is,
or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange)
and the Issuer, the Target or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure
standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the
Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports
that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards
(or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as
applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and _provided that such requirements_
require the Issuer, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports,
information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or
more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer
so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including
as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to
such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis;
(iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer on a
combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying
with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained
in the preceding paragraphs.

236


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this covenant, the Issuer shall be permitted to use financial
statements of the Target Group with respect to periods commencing prior to the Control Date; provided
that the Issuer also provides separate columns (to the extent applicable) relating to the Issuer as described
in clause (b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, and, when making any calculation required under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, includes the Indebtedness of the Issuer, as applicable.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the
Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the
Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, grant to any Person
other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries
described in the Senior Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer, the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or
otherwise modify or replace any Senior Secured Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend,
extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Senior Secured Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be
discharged and released in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Senior
Secured Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(iv) the applicable Senior Secured Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any
ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Issuer, the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect
Holders in any material respect; _provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (v) above, the_
Senior Secured Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released or otherwise modified or replaced pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any relevant action with
respect to Senior Secured Security Documents to which the Company is party as a security grantor,
confirming the solvency of the Company), after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a
certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, which
confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Senior Secured
Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or
replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the
event that the Issuer, the Company or an applicable Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements
of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or
other modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for
instructions from any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit Facility or any Public Debt, in each case
of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on
which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which Senior

237


-----

Secured Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; _provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be_
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for
the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or
shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably
necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth
under ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release.’’ A Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of
such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Original
Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that
date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the
liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws,_
_capital maintenance and other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured_
_Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_
_and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on
Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided that (1) such Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in
the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such
intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements
must not conflict.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also provides that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the
consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor

238


-----

Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured
Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of
the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens,
(7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are secured by first ranking Liens over
the Collateral. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of
the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also provides that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that
such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note,
shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours
on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Limitation on Activities of the Issuer_**

The Issuer shall not carry on any business or own any material assets other than:

(1) the Incurrence, Guarantee, offering, sale, issuance and servicing, listing, purchase, redemption,
exchange, refinancing or retirement of Indebtedness (and guarantees thereof, including the
Guarantees of the 2017 Senior Notes) permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or performance of the terms and conditions of such Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are
otherwise permissible under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the granting of any Liens

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer or lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any
Person, unless:

existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, or the United States of America,
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,

case of a Successor Issuer) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer,
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but in a case of a lease of
all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person; or

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or
a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such transaction;

(B) (1) either (x) the Issuer or another Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security
Documents, as applicable and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that (A) if the Issuer is not the surviving
entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer
under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents and clauses (1) and
(4) under the heading ‘‘—The Issuer’’ shall apply to such transaction; and (B) to the extent that any
Security Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant Guarantor would not, in
accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity, the
direct holding company of the relevant surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
grant a Security Interest over the shares in the capital of such surviving entity on substantially equivalent
terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation; or (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into
or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of
such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading ‘‘—The Issuer’’ or clause (3)
under this heading ‘‘Guarantors,’’ as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; or (v) any
Permitted Holdco Transaction.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph under the
heading ‘‘—The Issuer’’) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transactions and any Permitted Holdco Transactions will be permitted
without compliance with this section.

241


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note when due and payable, continued for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or, in respect
of the period prior to the availability of audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer
following the Original Issue Date, as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Target Group) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross
_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates A50.0 million or more at any time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary
(or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
A50.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies
issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged
and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next
succeeding paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered
by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment
or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(7) any Security Interest under the Senior Secured Security Documents having a fair market value in
excess of A20.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Senior Secured Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) for any reason other

242


-----

than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release
of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Security
Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security
Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) except as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) is held in any judicial proceeding to
be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor
that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor or
Guarantors, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee.

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not
cure such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and
the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Senior Secured Security
Documents except as provided in such Senior Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect
to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than
90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to
deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the
time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be
cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the

243


-----

time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the
Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability
or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder
may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested
in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be
required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by
taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if
and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and
what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However,

244


-----

without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the
then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the
time at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under
‘‘Optional Redemption’’ or ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;

(4) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due
dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under
‘‘Withholding Taxes’’ that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any
material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss
of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to
withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to
the covenant described under the heading ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the
release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in
the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which
require the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders
to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor under
any Senior Secured Notes Document;

245


-----

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Senior Secured
Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes that
may be issued in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,’’ to add Senior Secured Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to_
add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or
securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided
for under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents
or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ to the
extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ was intended to be a
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security
Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Senior
Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Senior Secured Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities, in any property which is required by the Senior Secured Security Documents or the Senior
Facilities (as in effect on the Original Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in
which a Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to
grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the transfer
and legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including
to facilitate the issuance and administration of Senior Secured Notes; _provided, however, that_
(i) compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior
Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior
Secured Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ relating to_
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or

(12) as provided in ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection
with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The

246


-----

Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a
consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior
Secured Notes Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior Secured Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Senior Secured Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the
Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer’’) and ‘‘Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross default upon a payment default, the
cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provisions described under
‘‘Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of
the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer’’), (4),
(5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under ‘‘Events of
_Default’’ above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ‘‘defeasance
_trust’’) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for_
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in
their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit
and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents will
be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the
Senior Secured Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) as to all Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously

247


-----

authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain
Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have
been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured
Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior
Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or
to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid
all other sums payable under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and
(5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating
that all conditions precedent under the ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been
complied with; _provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact_
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the
Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least three
Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice
of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity
or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view
of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited has been appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in such Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the
same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture imposes certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed
and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a
conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate
of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,

248


-----

then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any
loss, liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to
the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior
Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders
of Book Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person
by first class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed
within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall
not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the
Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be
due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
any Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by
such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein
for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the

249


-----

indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Euro
denominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such non Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the New Notes on the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the New Notes on the Exchange will be
approved, that permission to deal in the New Notes thereon will be granted or that such listing will be
maintained. Settlement of the New Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption
price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors have
irrevocably submitted and, and any additional Guarantors will irrevocably submit, in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City,
County and State of New York, in the United States of America. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture
provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action
or proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City
of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the
parties thereunder, and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereunder, are governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes may be amended with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured
Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder are governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Senior Secured Security Documents are
governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

power in connection with the acquisition or disposition of Voting Stock will not cause a party to be a
beneficial owner and (c) a Permitted Holdco Transaction shall not constitute a Change of Control.

subsequent to the commencement of the reference period but prior to or simultaneously with the event for
which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the ‘‘Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement,
extinguishment or other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter period;

described in the second paragraph under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than
Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c), (1)(d) and (5)(b) thereof);

265


-----

(ii) Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’; or (iii) Fixed Charges
attributable to any Indebtedness discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date to the
extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described under
the second paragraph under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than Fixed Charges
attributable to Indebtedness discharged on such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date using
proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c), (1)(d) and (5)(b) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’); provided further, however,
that at any time prior to the Control Entry Date, in calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
portion of Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred to finance the purchase of Target Shares in
an Acquisition (and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Existing Target Debt Financing and Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of Existing Target Debt Financing) shall be multiplied by a quotient equal to
(x) one, divided by (y) the percentage of the Target Shares held (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer as of
the date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to any increase in ownership of the Target Shares
resulting from the transaction or transactions from which such determination results or which are
contemplated in connection with any Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by the Issuer or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference period and on or
prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a
_pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations,_
consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in LTM EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the
reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment
pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving _pro forma_
effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the_ _pro forma_
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer
(and may include cost savings and synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is
being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference
period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a
Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred
to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a _pro forma basis_
shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period
except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank
offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if
none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

‘‘Fixed Charges’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

(1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period;

(2) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any
series of Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of such Person during such period; and

(3) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any
series of Disqualified Stock during this period.

For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any
domination agreement and profit and loss transfer agreement (including the Domination Agreement) to
minority shareholders shall constitute Fixed Charges.

‘‘GAAP’’ means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

conditions or otherwise); or

(2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness

_provided, however, that the term ‘‘Guarantee’’ will not include (x) endorsements for collection or deposit in_
the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice and (y) standard contractual indemnities or

such guaranteeing Person may be liable pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such
Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an unconditional guarantee of the entire amount of the primary

Person’s maximum reasonably anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such Person in good
faith. The term ‘‘Guarantee’’ used as a verb has a corresponding meaning.

effect on the Original Issue Date. At any time after the Original Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to
establish that IFRS shall mean IFRS as in effect on or prior to the date of such election; provided that any
such election, once made, shall be irrevocable. At any time after the Original Issue Date, the Issuer may
elect to apply GAAP accounting principles in lieu of IFRS and, upon any such election, references herein
to IFRS shall thereafter be construed to mean GAAP (except as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture), including as to the ability of the Issuer to make an election pursuant to the previous
sentence; _provided that any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable;_ _provided, further, that any_
calculation or determination in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that require the application of IFRS
for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to apply GAAP shall remain as
previously calculated or determined in accordance with IFRS; provided, further again, that the Issuer may
only make such election if it also elects to report any subsequent financial reports required to be made by
the Issuer. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the
Trustee and the Holders. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the impact of IFRS 16 (Leases) and any
successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under GAAP) shall be disregarded with respect to
all ratios, calculations and determinations based upon IFRS to be calculated or made, as the case may be,
pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (without limitation) any lease, concession or license
of property that would be considered an operating lease under IFRS (or, as applicable, GAAP) as of the

otherwise) will be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary at the time it becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary and the terms ‘‘Incurred’’ and ‘‘Incurrence’’ have meanings correlative to the foregoing and any

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Additional Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’). The Additional Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the ‘‘144A
Global Notes,’’ the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the New Issue Date, with a
common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘144A Book Entry Interests’’) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book Entry Interest’’ and, together with the
144A Book Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book Entry
Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book
entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit on their respective book entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of
the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Additional Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global
Notes will not have the Additional Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the
Additional Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or ‘‘holder’’ of
Additional Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Additional Notes are held in global form, the common depositary Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
and the participants through which they own Book Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar nor any
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the
records relating to the Book Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, owners of Book Entry Interests will receive
definitive registered Additional Notes, respectively, in certificated form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered
Notes’’):

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In such an event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the
name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ unless that legend is
not required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or applicable law.

291


-----

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the
Additional Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book Entry Interest of less than
A100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes
(including principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) to the Paying Agent. In
turn, each Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depository for Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures.

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture governing the Additional Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and Registrar will treat the registered
holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominees))
as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and Registrar or any of
their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book Entry Interest, for any such for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book Entry Interest; or

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in
‘‘street name.’’

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes and the Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interest in the Additional Notes through Euroclear
and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that they will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of Additional Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to
whose account the Book Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting
of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is
an event of default under the Additional Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to
exchange the Additional Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

292


-----

**Transfers**

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Book Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the New
Issue Date (the ‘‘40 day period’’), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the
same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional
buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and in
accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40 day period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note without compliance with these certification requirements.

Rule 144A Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book Entry Interest denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the Trustee of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) from the transferor to
the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in ‘‘Transfer Restrictions,’’ Book Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange.’’ Any Book Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes_
delivery in the form of a Book Entry Interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a
Book Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book Entry Interest in the other
Global Note, respectively, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such
a Book Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and, if required,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to such Additional Notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial
Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise

293


-----

take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest.
The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive
form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition,
owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book Entry System**

The Additional Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of
Exchange. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Additional
Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Additional Notes will be made in euro. Book Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional
Eurobonds in registered form. Book Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for
value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time
of trading of any Book Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

294

**CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES**

**German Taxation**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Additional Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider
any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the
tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes, including the effect of
any state or local or church taxes under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are
residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**Withholding Tax**

Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Additional Notes who is a German tax
resident (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management is
located in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Additional Notes
are kept or administered in a custodial account with or presented for an over the counter payment to a
German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, securities trading
company or securities trading bank (each, a ‘‘Disbursing Agent’’, auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax
rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the
total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the
Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with
the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f¨ur Steuern) in which case the holders will have
to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for church tax. The Senior Notes Issuer of
the Additional Notes should under German law not be required to deduct withholding tax from the
proceeds of the investment in the Additional Notes.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and
losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Additional Notes (‘‘Accrued Interest’’ St¨uckzinsen) derived by an
individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the
Additional Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of
their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the
Additional Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to
proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims if the Additional
Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Additional Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the
same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon,
the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus
Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the
actual acquisition costs of the Additional Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a
bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the EEA or the countries/territories
Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San
Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the
withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes has been
calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax
resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs;
however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident
individual holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of
the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Additional
Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares).
The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Additional Notes or other securities paid

295


-----

separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to
certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on
investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial
account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_
withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted
if the holder of the Additional Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment
(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the
status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing
payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of
foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Additional Notes form part of a trade or
business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income
and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German
taxation (as outlined below under ‘‘—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents’’)
and the Additional Notes are held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax
will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to
tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains**

**_Tax Residents_**

This subsection ‘‘—Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in
Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Additional Notes held by an individual holder who is
tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus
solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Additional Notes are
held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are
entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for married couples and for
partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a_
capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Additional Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as
described under ‘‘—Withholding Tax’’ above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such
as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment
process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated
from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its
interest income and capital gains derived from the Additional Notes in its annual tax return and will then
also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon).
Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower
individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In
each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.
Losses incurred with respect to the Additional Notes may only be offset with investment income of the
individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods.

Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a
receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other
default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of
A10,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of A10.000 can be carried forward and might be

296


-----

usable in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to
an amount of A10.000 per year.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the
Additional Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any,
will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or
corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part
of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as
income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax
return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will
be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to
the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of
a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Additional Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade
tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an
individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly
credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

**_Non-Tax Residents_**

This subsection ‘‘—Non-Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany
(i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and
control is not located in Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes received by holders who are not
tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Additional Notes form
part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a
fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source
income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs property or income from
capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate or income from a hybrid
instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer, unless the Additional Notes qualify as global certificates
(Sammelurkunden) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as
fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the Additional Notes to
qualify for this exception so long as they are held in global form. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to
that explained above under ‘‘—Tax Residents’’ applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in
Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an
over-the-counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Additional Notes are not held in
custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not
tax-resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable tax
treaty.

**Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge**

According to a bill enacted in December 2019, the solidarity surcharge will be partially abolished as of the
assessment period 2021 for certain individuals.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident
or deemed to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied
unless (i) the Additional Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent
establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii) the
obligations under the Additional Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate
(unless the Additional Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the Additional Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they
are held in global form. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously
maintained a residence in Germany.

297


-----

**Other Taxes**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Additional Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Verm¨ogenssteuer) is not
levied in Germany.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to
introduce a financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one
financial intermediary). The timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. Prospective
holders of the Additional Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
financial transaction tax.

**Proposed Abolishment of German WHT on Interest Income**

The German Government intends to abolish the current flat taxation (Abgeltungsteuer) of 25% (plus
solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if
applicable) on interest income received by private individuals. As a result, interest on the Additional Notes
could become subject to a taxation at a respective Additional Note holder’s individual personal tax rate
(where such noteholder is a tax resident of Germany) up to a tax rate of 45% (plus solidarity surcharge at a
rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable).

**Payment by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions
of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that
such payments by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will be eligible for exemption from withholding tax.

**Netherlands Taxation**

The information set out below is a general summary of certain material Dutch tax consequences in
connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the Additional Notes. This summary is not a
comprehensive or complete description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant for a
particular holder of Additional Notes and it does not address the tax consequences that may arise in any
jurisdiction other than The Netherlands in connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the
Additional Notes. For Dutch tax purposes, a holder of Additional Notes may include an individual who or
an entity that does not have the legal title to the Additional Notes, but to whom nevertheless the
Additional Notes, or the income thereof, are attributed based either on such individual or entity holding a
beneficial interest in the Additional Notes or based on specific statutory provisions.

This summary is based on the tax laws of The Netherlands as in effect on the date of this offering
memorandum, and as applied and interpreted in case law of the courts of The Netherlands and in
administrative guidance of the relevant authorities of The Netherlands, in each case as available in printed
form on or before the date of this offering memorandum, without prejudice to any developments or
amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Any reference in this summary to The Netherlands and to Netherlands or Dutch tax law are to the
European part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands and its law, respectively, only.

As this summary is intended as general information only, (prospective) holders of Additional Notes should
consult their own tax advisors as to the Dutch or other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
transfer of Additional Notes, including, in particular, the application to their particular situations of the tax
considerations discussed below. Holders of Additional Notes may be subject to a special tax treatment
under any applicable law and this summary is not intended to be applicable in respect of all categories of
holders of Additional Notes.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Any payments to be made by the Dutch Guarantor under the Additional Notes may be made free of
withholding or deduction for or on the account of any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld
or assessed by The Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

298


-----

**_Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021_**

As of 1 January 2021, the (deemed) payment of interest (including guarantee payments) due by
(verschuldigd door) a paying entity (inhoudingsplichtige) that (x) is (deemed) resident (gevestigd) in The
Netherlands or (y) has a permanent establishment in The Netherlands to which the (deemed) payment of
interest (or guarantee payment) is allocated, will be subject to withholding tax in the event that such paying
entity is related (gelieerd) to the entity entitled to such (deemed) payment (voordeelgerechtigde) and such
related recipient entity (i) is (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction (laagbelastende jurisdictie) or
(ii) has a permanent establishment in such low tax jurisdiction to which the interest (or guarantee
payment) is allocated (worden toegerekend).

In addition, if the related recipient entity is not (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction, the
aforementioned withholding tax nevertheless applies in case (a) such entity is entitled to the (deemed)
payment of interest (or guarantee payment) with the main purpose or one of the main purposes of
avoiding withholding tax in the hands of another person or entity and (b) there is an artificial arrangement
or transaction, or a series of artificial arrangements or transactions. An arrangement or transaction, or
series of arrangements or transactions, shall be regarded as artificial to the extent that it is not put into
place for valid commercial reasons, which reflect economic reality. The aforementioned withholding tax
may further apply if a related entity is from a Dutch tax perspective regarded the recipient of the (deemed)
payment of interest (or guarantee payments), whereas such related recipient entity is not regarded as the
recipient (gerechtigde) thereof pursuant to the laws of the country in which such entity is (deemed) resident
or pursuant to the laws of which such entity is established (opgericht).

**_Interest payments_**

The term ‘interest’ refers to any remuneration, payment or benefit of whatever nature for moneys
advanced pursuant to a loan (geldlening) or equivalent agreement such as for instance financial lease. This
includes interest accrual and the compensation of costs.

**_Related entities_**

Entities (lichamen) are related for purposes of the application of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 if
(i) the recipient entity (alone or together with other entities forming a cooperating group) has a qualifying
interest in the interest (or guarantee) paying entity or if (ii) the paying entity (alone or together with other
entities forming a cooperating group) has a qualifying interest in the recipient entity or if (iii) a third party
(alone or together with other entities forming a cooperating group) has a qualifying interest in both the
recipient entity as well as the interest (or guarantee) paying entity. An interest in an entity is considered a
‘qualifying interest’ if directly or indirectly the influence in the decision making is such that the decisions of
an entity and thus its activities can be determined. In any case, an interest is qualifying if it represents more
than 50% of the statutory voting rights in an entity.

**_Low tax jurisdictions_**

A jurisdiction qualifies as a low tax jurisdiction for purposes of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 if it is
listed in an annually updated ministerial decree published by the Dutch government which includes
jurisdictions (i) with a profit tax applying a statutory rate of less than 9% (updated annually based on an
assessment as per 1 October of the preceding year) or (ii) included on the EU list of non-cooperative
jurisdictions in the preceding year.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

This summary is not intended for any holder of Additional Notes:

(i) for whom the income or capital gains derived from the Additional Notes are attributable to a
membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an employment relationship, a deemed
employment relationship or a management role, the income of which is taxable in The Netherlands;

(ii) who has, or that has, a Substantial Interest or a deemed Substantial Interest (as defined and explained
below) in the Dutch Guarantor;

(iii) that is an entity that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands and that is, in whole or in
part, not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as qualifying pension funds);

299


-----

(iv) that is an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) or a fiscal investment
institution (fiscale beleggingsinstelling) as meant in articles 6a and 28 of the Dutch Corporate Income
Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969), respectively; or

(v) who is, or that is, not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Additional Notes
and/or the income and/or capital gains derived from the Additional Notes.

Generally a holder of Additional Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in the Dutch
Guarantor if he holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily
defined term in Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights
over, shares representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and
outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Dutch Guarantor, or rights to acquire shares, whether or
not already issued, that represent at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or
the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Dutch Guarantor, or the ownership of
certain profit participating certificates that relate to 5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of
the liquidation proceeds of the Dutch Guarantor (a ‘‘Substantial Interest’’).

A holder of Additional Notes will also have a Substantial Interest in the Dutch Guarantor if one of certain
relatives of that holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in the Dutch Guarantor. If a holder of
Additional Notes does not have a Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if
(part of) a Substantial Interest has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without
recognizing a taxable gain.

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

A holder of Additional Notes who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Individual’’), will generally be subject to
Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the
Additional Notes at the progressive rates up to 49.50% (maximum rate for 2020) if:

(i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur
(ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an
entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Additional Notes are attributable or deemed
to be attributable; or

(ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the Additional Notes, as the case may be, that are
taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), as defined in
the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), which include the performance of
activities with respect to the Additional Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management
(normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief
_belang)._

If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will
generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, regardless of the actual income or capital
gains derived from the Additional Notes. This deemed return is calculated by applying the applicable
deemed return percentage(s) to the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag), insofar this exceeds a
certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair market value
of certain qualifying assets (including, as the case may be, the Additional Notes) held by the Dutch
Resident Individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both determined on January 1
of the relevant year. The deemed return percentages to be applied to the yield basis increase progressively
from 1.79% to 5.28% (rates for 2020), depending on such individual’s yield basis. The deemed return
percentages are adjusted annually. The deemed return will be taxed at a rate of 30% (rate for 2020).

_Dutch Resident Entities_

A holder of Additional Notes that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual fund, in
each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity) and that is resident or deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Entity’’), will generally be subject to
Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived
from the Additional Notes. The Dutch corporate income tax rate is 16.50% for the first A200,000 of the
taxable amount and 25% of the taxable amount exceeding A200,000 (rates for 2020).

300


-----

_Non-Dutch Residents_

A holder of Additional Notes who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch
Resident Entity (a ‘‘Non-Dutch Resident’’), is generally not subject to Dutch income tax or Dutch
corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Additional Notes, provided
that:

(i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as
an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise
(other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on
through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste
_vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case_
may be, the Additional Notes are attributable or deemed attributable;

(ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or
capital gains from the Additional Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from
‘miscellaneous activities’ performed in The Netherlands (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden in
_Nederland), as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), which include_
the performance of activities in respect of the Additional Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio
management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative
interest (lucratief belang);

(iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in the
profits of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of
securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Additional Notes or
payments in respect of the Additional Notes are attributable; and

(iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual
fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity), such entity is neither entitled to a share
in the profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in
The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the Additional
Notes or payments in respect of the Additional Notes are attributable.

**_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_**

_Dutch Residents_

Generally, gift taxes (schenkbelasting) and inheritance taxes (erfbelasting) may arise in The Netherlands
with respect to a transfer of the Additional Notes by way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of
Additional Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the
Dutch Gift and Inheritance Tax Act 1956 (Successiewet 1956) at the time of the gift or his/her death.

_Non-Dutch Residents_

No Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will be levied on the transfer of Additional Notes by way of gift by, or on
the death of, a holder of Additional Notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant provisions, unless:

(i) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or bequest or as a gift made by or on behalf of a person
who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose
of the relevant provisions;

(ii) such holder dies while being resident or deemed resident in The Netherlands within 180 days after the
date of a gift of the Additional Notes; or

(iii) the gift is made under a condition precedent and such holder is or is deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of the Dutch Gift and Inheritance Tax Act 1956, an individual who is of the Dutch nationality
will be deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if he/she has been resident in The Netherlands at any
time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his/her death.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax, an individual will, irrespective of his/her nationality, be deemed to be
resident in The Netherlands if he/she has been resident in The Netherlands at any time during the twelve
months preceding the date of the gift. The same twelve month rule may apply to entities that have

301


-----

transferred their seat of residence out of The Netherlands. Applicable tax treaties concluded by The
Netherlands may override such deemed residency.

**_Value Added Tax_**

No Dutch value added tax (omzetbelasting) is payable by a holder of Additional Notes in respect of
payments of interest and principal under the Additional Notes or on a transfer of Additional Notes (other
than value added tax due on fees payable in respect of additional services not exempt from Dutch value
added tax).

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty will be payable in The Netherlands
by a holder of Additional Notes in respect of or in connection with the acquisition, ownership or transfer of
the Additional Notes.

**_Residence_**

A holder of Additional Notes will not become or be deemed to become a resident of The Netherlands for
tax purposes solely by reason of the acquisition, ownership or transfer of the Additional Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
potential tax considerations. The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined
below), except for the discussions below under ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,’’ and does not address
the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax
laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or any considerations under any applicable income tax treaty.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Code, Treasury regulations
issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date
hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect which could
significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. No rulings from the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different position
concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Additional Notes than
those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A
different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of
income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Additional Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, alternative minimum tax, special tax
accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the Additional Notes being taken
into account on an applicable financial statement, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks,
broker-dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies,
individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, or other
pass-through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, persons
purchasing or selling notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, corporations that accumulate earnings
to avoid U.S. federal income tax, and persons holding the Additional Notes as part of a ‘‘straddle,’’
‘‘hedge,’’ ‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to
persons who purchase the Additional Notes in the offering hereby at their initial ‘‘issue price’’ (generally
the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes are sold for money to investors (excluding bond
houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement
agents, or wholesalers)), and who hold the Additional Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for
investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of an Additional Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a

302


-----

corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia, (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more ‘‘United States persons’’ (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid
election in place to be treated as a ‘‘United States persons’’ (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code).

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of the
Additional Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the
status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an
investment in the Additional Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
Additional Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning
the tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of the Additional Notes in light of their
particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed
below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, non-U.S. or other
tax laws.

**No Fungibility for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes**

The Additional Notes offered hereby will not be part of the same issue as the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and will not be treated as having the same issue date, issue price or adjusted issue price as the
Existing Senior Secured Notes or otherwise be treated as fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes’’) we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or_
principal on the Additional Notes. If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to
certain exceptions, the Additional Notes may be treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt
instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income
recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Under the applicable Treasury
regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a
contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the issue date, such contingencies in the aggregate are
considered ‘‘remote’’ or ‘‘incidental.’’ Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the
position that the foregoing contingencies should be treated, in the aggregate, as remote and/or incidental
within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in
the Additional Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury
regulations. Therefore, we do not intend to treat any such potential payments as part of the yield to
maturity of the Additional Notes. Our determination that this contingency is remote or incidental is
binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the
year during which it acquires the Additional Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our
position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, among
other adverse tax consequences, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on its Additional Notes
based upon a ‘‘comparable yield’’ (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in excess of stated interest, and
to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income recognized on the taxable disposition of an
Additional Note, and to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a
manner different than that described below. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the tax
consequences if the Additional Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The discussion
below assumes that the Additional Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Payments of Stated Interest**

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income the
U.S. dollar value of the Euro denominated interest payment on an Additional Note based on the spot rate

303


-----

of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on an Additional
Note in Euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

- the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within such
U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or

- at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or
the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one
taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the
accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments
held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or
thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference between (i) the value of the Euros
received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt,
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount
previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss
will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source, and generally will not be
treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Additional Notes.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible
for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that
depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the availability of foreign tax credits. Interest generally will be income from sources outside of
the United States and generally will be considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax
credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws.

**Original Issue Discount**

The Additional Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and consequently a
U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally will be required to include in gross
income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis before the
U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The amount of OID includible in gross
income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Additional Notes
for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Additional Notes. Generally, the
daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an ‘‘accrual period’’ (other than the initial short
accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period.
The OID allocable to any accrual period will generally equal (a) the product of the ‘‘adjusted issue price’’
of the Additional Notes as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Additional Notes’ ‘‘yield to
maturity’’ (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual
period. The term ‘‘qualified stated interest’’ generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable
in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as constructively received,
at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Stated interest on
the Additional Notes should be treated as qualified stated interest. The ‘‘yield to maturity’’ is the discount
rate that, when applied to all payments under the Additional Notes as of its issue date, results in a present
value equal to the Additional Notes’ issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual
period generally may be computed under any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the
final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount of the Additional Notes and the
adjusted issue price of the Additional Notes at the beginning of the final accrual period. The ‘‘adjusted
issue price’’ of an Additional Note as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its issue
price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder of the Additional Notes
generally will be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual
periods. A U.S. Holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on the
Additional Notes as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described
above. The election is to be made for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder acquired the Additional

304


-----

Notes and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors about this election.

A U.S. Holder of Additional Notes treated as issued with OID must (i) determine OID allocable to each
accrual period in euros using the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the amount of
OID into U.S. dollars and recognize foreign currency gain or loss in the same manner as described above
for stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or
loss when OID is paid (including, upon the taxable disposition of an Additional Note, the receipt of
proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, determined based on the
spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as
determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on an Additional Note will be
viewed: first, as payments of stated interest payable on the Additional Note; second, as receipts of
previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual
periods first; and third, as receipts of principal. U.S. Holders should note that because the cash payment in
respect of accrued OID on an Additional Note will not be made until maturity or other disposal of the
Additional Note, a greater possibility exists for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (and the
required recognition of exchange gain or loss) than is the case for foreign currency instruments issued
without OID. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the interplay between the
application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules.

OID generally will be income from sources outside of the United States and generally will be considered
‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under
U.S. federal income tax laws.

**Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Additional Notes**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other taxable disposition of an
Additional Note, except as noted below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, a
U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized by such U.S. Holder (except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest, which, if applicable, will be taxable as described above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’) and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note. Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted tax basis
of an Additional Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price
calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase, decreased by the amount of any payments
made on such Additional Note (other than payments of stated interest), and increased by any OID accrued
by such U.S. Holder with respect to the Additional Notes. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the
disposition of an Additional Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received calculated at
the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition.

If the Additional Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash
method of tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting,
will determine the U.S. dollar value of its adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note and the amount realized
on the disposition of an Additional Note by translating Euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the
settlement date of the purchase or the disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis
U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from
year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the
Additional Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by
non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any,
recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of
calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other
taxable disposition of an Additional Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent
that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in
which the U.S. Holder held such Additional Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal
the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date (1) the Additional Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if
applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition, upon
the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a

305


-----

U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with
respect to previously accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as discussed above under
‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’ The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in this
paragraph will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of an Additional
Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for
U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

**Reportable Transactions**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in ‘‘reportable transactions’’ (as
defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure
statement on IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). The Treasury regulations
could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency
exchange loss from the Additional Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant
threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the
tax reporting obligations, if any, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886, with respect to the
ownership or disposition of the Additional Notes or any related transaction such as the disposition of any
Euros received in respect of the Additional Notes.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest (including
the accrual of OID) on the Additional Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including
a retirement or redemption) of an Additional Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an
exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The
payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently
at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer
identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (2) the IRS notifies the payor
that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect; (3) there has been a
‘‘notified payee underreporting’’ described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the U.S. Holder has not
certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is
a ‘‘United States person’’ (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), and that the IRS has not notified
such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or
a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any,
of the backup withholding rules on their particular circumstances.

**Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’
(as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in the
Additional Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Additional Notes held in
accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). Under certain circumstances, an entity may be
treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (‘‘FATCA’’)
generally impose a withholding tax (currently at a rate of 30%) on interest income (including, for this
purpose, accrued OID) paid on a debt obligation and, subject to regulatory relief described below, on the
gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a debt obligation if such interest income or gross
proceeds are treated as passthru payments attributable to certain U.S. source payments, in each case, to
(i) a foreign financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner),
unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide
to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of
such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain
account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners) or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a
financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such

306


-----

entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the
entity, which generally includes any ‘‘United States person’’ (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity, in each case, unless another exemption
applies. Investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the implications of FATCA on their
investment in an Additional Note.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is treated as a foreign
financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on a series of the Additional Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Additional Notes of such series for U.S. federal income tax purposes after
the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the
United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to
implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Under proposed Treasury
regulations that may be relied upon pending finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds would be
eliminated and, consequently, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds is not currently expected to apply.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE ADDITIONAL NOTES IN LIGHT OF
THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF**
**THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 (the ‘‘Recast Insolvency Regulation’’),
replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended
(the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) and starting from June 26, 2017, the court which shall have jurisdiction
to open the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the
European Union, other than Denmark, (a ‘‘Regulated Member State’’) within the territory of which the
company concerned has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’

In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be its
centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary (Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation). That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
Regulated Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. In addition, that presumption is rebuttable, and the relevant court of a Regulated Member
State should carefully assess whether the centre of main interests is genuinely located in that Regulated
Member State. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut the presumption where the company’s central
administration is located in a Regulated Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third
parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its
interests is located in that other Regulated Member State (Recital (30) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation). When determining whether the centre of main interests is ascertainable by third parties,
special consideration should be given to the creditors and to their perception as to where a company
conducts the administration of its interests. This may require, in the event of a shift of centre of main
interests, informing creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in
due course, for example by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence, or
by making the new location public through other appropriate means (Recital (28) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation).

If the centre of main interests of the debtor is located in the Regulated Member State in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall be opened
in that Regulated Member State and accordingly the courts of that Regulated Member State shall have
jurisdiction to open any of the insolvency proceedings applicable in that Regulated Member State (see
Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation).

Notwithstanding the opening of a main insolvency proceeding in a Regulated Member State, ‘‘secondary
insolvency proceedings’’ may be opened in another Regulated Member State if such debtor possesses an
‘‘establishment’’ (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in that Member State.
The effects of these proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor in the territory of that
Regulated Member State.

If the debtor possesses an ‘‘establishment’’ in a Regulated Member State, ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ under
Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation may be opened prior to the opening of main insolvency
proceedings, where (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down
by the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the center of the debtor’s main
interests is situated or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor
whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the
territory of the Regulated Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a
public authority which, under the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the
establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main
insolvency proceedings are opened, the territorial insolvency proceedings shall become secondary
insolvency proceedings.

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any provider of collateral experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or
similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws
may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the collateral
provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other company. The insolvency, administration and
other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be

308


-----

materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency
laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have
their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event
of an insolvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor organized under
the laws of Germany and/or having its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in Germany (the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and any other such Guarantor, a ‘‘German Notes Guarantor’’) at the time the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings
would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law.
Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with
German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the
centre of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See ‘‘Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes_
_Guarantees and Security Interests—European Union.’’_

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the
United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of
creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority
recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your
ability to recover payments due on the Additional Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising
under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit),
meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period
longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on
their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly
likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on an up to two year forecast horizon (positive
_Fortf¨uhrungsprognose). If a limited liability company (GmbH), a public limited liability company_
(Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other
company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of
illiquidity and/or over indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such company and,
in certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not
later than three weeks after such illiquidity and/or over indebtedness occurred or (as the case may be) was
established. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as
well as sanctions under criminal law. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities
exceed the value of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business
can survive as a going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), if there is
the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in
time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for
the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and/or is over indebted
(Uberschuldung[¨] ) it may also file for preliminary debtor in possession moratorium proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a
successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee
(vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable
assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement
actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which

309


-----

ideally shall be implemented in formal debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal
insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to
enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these
protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the
debtor’s business.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in
the Case of Insolvency Caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (the
‘‘COVInsAG’’), provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until September 30, 2020.
The suspension applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic or
there is no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If the debtor was able to
pay its debts on December 31, 2019—so that the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig)—it is assumed
that the insolvency was caused by the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic and that there are prospects of
remedying an existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). The COVInsAG also provides that insolvency
proceedings based on creditors’ insolvency filings in the period from March 28, 2020 to June 28, 2020 can
only be opened if the event of illiquidity or over-indebtedness already existed on March 1, 2020. However,
the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection will be authorized by regulation to extend the
suspensions until March 31, 2021 if this appears to be necessary due to the continuing demand for available
public aid, ongoing financing difficulties, or other circumstances. The COVInsAG also provides for a relief
from claw-back for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the
creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts
of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17
of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the
court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary
insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary
administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include
safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be
sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court,
even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary
insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by
unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures the court sees as appropriate.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a ‘‘preliminary creditors’
committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

(a) a balance sheet total in excess of A6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

(b) revenues of at least A12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

(c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the
selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor in possession proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorl¨aufiger)_ _Sachwalter). The court opens_
formal insolvency proceedings (Er¨offnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met,
including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the
debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the
insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the
insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the

310


-----

costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has ordered debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court
will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor),
upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the
debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) will only
be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of
votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to
become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder,
i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case
of debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness
and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as
preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities
created by the debtor including the Guarantees.

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See
‘‘—Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the
_Restructuring Directive’’)._

For the holders of the Additional Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency
proceedings against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s subject to
the German insolvency regime would include the following:

(a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer
and dispose of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s assets would
generally pass to the (preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorl¨aufiger) _Insolvenzverwalter) as sole_
representative of the insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s management after the opening
of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

(c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the
debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null
and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings;

(d) claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may
generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung); and

(e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does
not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the
claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the
insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the
occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte
_oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_
whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination
rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German
law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegl¨aubiger) as opposed to a

311


-----

preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in
the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the
assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an
individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic
stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the
time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German
insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their
individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance
with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors
may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency
estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce
their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant
collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In
this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such
realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains
entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The
insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession
that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims
that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in
legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement
process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of
any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of
and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9%
(or more as agreed upon individually) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the
secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount
equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (‘‘excess proceeds’’) will be allocated to the insolvency
estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for
and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency
court as well as the members of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential
liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the
Additional Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
securing the Additional Notes). If a German Notes Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German
insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Additional
Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however,
the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant
collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations under the Additional Notes by the German Notes Guarantors after such secured creditors have
been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may
take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to
unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which
requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt
to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to
equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. Under certain conditions, the debtor
may also file for protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon request of
the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets)
and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for
up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not
obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Given the relatively

312


-----

recent enactment of these amendments, these provisions may not have been tested in practice and no
judicial precedents are available in such respect.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency
law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German
insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis `a vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. As a
general principle, the claims arising from a guarantee may be enforced against a German Notes Guarantor
outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Any insolvency
proceeding over the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would, however, be a rather strong
indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly
deteriorated, which may cause a German Notes Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency. On April 13,
2017, the German legislator passed an act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur
_Erleichterung der Bew¨altigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018. This act is_
mainly intended to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group
companies. This act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent
group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of
claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German
Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court
may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen Gerichtsstand); (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated;
(iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordinator’’ (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability
to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including,
but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of
repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and
undertakings in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may result in the holders of the Additional Notes
and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a ‘‘shareholder like position’’ (gesellschafter¨ahnliche
_Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor, the_
claims arising from a Senior Secured Notes Guarantees would be treated as a subordinated insolvency
claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in
the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor unless the insolvency court
handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed
which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person
who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally
rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under ‘‘—Satisfaction of
_Subordinated Claims.’’_

During the suspension of filing obligations as set out in the preceding paragraph, the COVInsAG also
provides for a relief from lender liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is
not regarded against bones mores. This relief shall include deferrals and ‘‘amend & extend’’ transactions.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such
time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

_Limitations on Enforcement_

Some of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability
company (GmbH) and/or a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Consequently, the granting
of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the
German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr¨ankter Haftung,
_‘‘GmbHG’’), the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and other laws. These provisions would also apply_
to any future German Notes Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited
liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG) or Aktiengesellschaft.

313


-----

_GmbH Limitation Language_

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net
assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its
stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by
a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be
considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to
issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures,
credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to
subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner
incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the
guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement
does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner,
such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are
already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced.
Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security
Documents provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such
limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral is limited in the manner described. This
could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German
Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG incorporated into the relevant Notes
Documents, in particular in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, is substantially be in the form as follows:

‘‘

(a) The restrictions in this Clause shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and other payment
obligations under this Clause or any other provision in this Indenture and/or any other documents in
connection therewith granted by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Germany as a limited
liability company (GmbH) (a ‘‘German GmbH Guarantor’’) to secure liabilities of its current or any
future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding
any direct or indirect subsidiary of such Guarantor) (cross stream) (a ‘‘Guarantee’’).

(b) The restrictions in this Clause shall not apply:

(i) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent the German GmbH
Guarantor secures any indebtedness under this Indenture in respect of (i) loans to the extent
such loans are (directly or indirectly) on lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant
German GmbH Guarantor or its subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are
issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the
German GmbH Guarantor’s subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on lending or
otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the
enforcement of the Guarantee; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (b) shall
have the effect that such on lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip);

(ii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), if, at the time of enforcement of the
Guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) as per Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)_
(either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer
agreements) exists between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company,
and:

(A) that German GmbH Guarantor is a subsidiary of the relevant obligor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant Guarantee, that Guarantor; or

(B) the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by
the relevant Guarantee are both subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company
and such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen), in each case to
the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement

314


-----

(Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) leads to the inapplicability of section 30
paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG);

(iii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent any payment under the
Guarantee demanded by the Trustee from the relevant German GmbH Guarantor is covered
(gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs oder R¨uckgew¨ahranspruch) of the German GmbH Guarantor against the affiliate_
whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee; or

(iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the Guarantee has been
enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this Clause because the Management
Notification (as defined herein) and/or the Auditor’s Determination (as defined below) has not
(or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the
Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four months from its due date in
accordance with paragraph (e) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the German GmbH
Guarantor repay any amount received from the German GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the
Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s
Determination had been delivered in a timely manner.

(c) The parties to this Indenture agree that if and to the extent payment under the Guarantee would
cause (i) the amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets, as calculated and defined pursuant
to paragraph (g) below, to fall below the amount required to maintain its registered share capital
(Stammkapital) or increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share
capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating sections 30, 31 of the German Limited Liability Company
Act (GmbHG) (such event, a ‘‘Capital Impairment’’), or (ii) a German GmbH Guarantor to be
deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors and thereby violating
Section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (such event, a
‘‘Liquidity Impairment’’) then the Trustee shall not enforce and the German GmbH Guarantor shall,
subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, have a defense (Einrede) against any claim under the
Guarantee if and to the extent such Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur.

(d) If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in (the ‘‘Management
Notification’’) within fifteen (15) business days after the making of a demand against that
German GmbH Guarantor under the Guarantee:

(i) to what extent such Guarantee is an upstream or cross stream guarantee or indemnity; and

(ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result of an
enforcement of the Guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its Net Assets or to
which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up to date pro forma balance sheet or
liquidity statement),

then the restrictions set out in this Clause shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been
provided.

(e) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) business days of
its receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty five
(45) business days of receipt of such request a determination by the German GmbH Guarantor’s
auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation (the ‘‘Auditor’s
Determination’’) appointed by the German GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting
out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Guarantee would cause a Capital
Impairment or Liquidity Impairment, subject to the terms set out under this Clause. Save for manifest
errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(f) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any
or only partial payment under the Guarantee, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial
conditions of the German GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has
substantially improved, the Trustee may (acting reasonably), at the German GmbH Guarantor’s cost
and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the German GmbH
Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s
Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such auditors
to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment

315


-----

has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the German GmbH
Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to
the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s Determination.
The Trustee may only demand payment under the Guarantee to the extent the auditors determine that
the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment have been cured.

(g) The net assets (Reinverm¨ogen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the ‘‘Net Assets’’) shall be
calculated in accordance with section 42 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG),
sections 242, 264 of the HGB and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from time
to time in Germany (Grunds¨atze ordnungsgem¨aßer Buchf¨uhrung) and for the purposes of calculating
the Net Assets, the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH
Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became a party to
this Agreement and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerh¨ohung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall
be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant
German GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under this Indenture and has been carried
out without the prior written consent of the agent;

(ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 253 subsection 6 of the HGB shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 268 subsection 8 of the HGB shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 272 subsection 5 of the HGB shall
not be included in the calculation of Net Assets; and

(v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly
negligent violation of this Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(h) Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this Clause that the
Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall (A) realize, to the extent lawful and
within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the
balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the
assets and are not necessary (betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business,
and (B) use best efforts to realize, to the extent legally permitted in a situation where it does not have
sufficient liquidity to fulfil its liabilities to its creditors, any and all of its assets if the relevant asset is
not necessary for the German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

(i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this Indenture to
the Trustee.

(j) Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming in
court that the provision of this Guarantee and/or making payments under this Guarantee by the
relevant German GmbH Guarantor does or does not fall within the scope of sections 30, 31 and/or 64
sentence 3 of the of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) and/or section 826
German Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch).

(k) In addition to the restrictions set out in this Clause, if a German GmbH Guarantor demonstrates that,
according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher
regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any upstream or cross stream
guarantee or security interest against such German GmbH Guarantor would result in personal liability
of its managing director(s) (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) for a reimbursement of payments made under the
Guarantee (including, without limitation, pursuant to section 826 of the German Civil Code
(B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch)), the German GmbH Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against the
Guarantee to the extent required in order not to incur such liability.

(l) The provisions of this Clause shall apply to a limited partnership with a limited liability company as its
general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) _mutatis mutandis and all references to Capital Impairment,_
Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets shall be construed as a reference to the Capital Impairment,
Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets of the general partner (Komplement¨ar) of the German GmbH
Guarantor.

316


-----

(m) For the purposes of this Clause, a reference to a ‘‘German GmbH Guarantor’’ includes any limited
liability company incorporated (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general
partner) in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is in
Germany.

(n) (n) The parties are aware that—due to recent developments—it is currently discussed which point in
time is relevant when determining whether a managing director or other representative of a German
guarantor has complied with the capital maintenance provisions. In respect of a valuation of the Net
Assets which are available for enforcement of a guarantee without causing any liability for
management, the parties consider the point in time of the enforcement of the Guarantee as being
relevant which is therefore the relevant point in time for calculating the available Net Assets purposes
of this Clause. Should new legislation or jurisprudence of a higher regional court (Oberlandesgericht)
or the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (including, without limitation, based on
proceedings initiated by the relevant Guarantor and/or its managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer)) be
published and/or come into force after the date of this Indenture and should such law or court ruling
lead to a different legal and/or factual assessment:

(i) of the granting of the guarantee by the relevant Guarantor, the Trustee shall, upon the relevant
Guarantor’s managing directors’ (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) request, enter into
good faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent necessary to avoid
the managing directors’ (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) personal liability resulting
from the granting of the guarantee (taking into account the initial intention of the limitations set
out in this Clause and, including but not limited to, amending reference points for the assessment
whether or not a violation of sections 30, 31 GmbHG has occurred); or

(ii) of the enforcement of the guarantee so that the limitations in this Clause are, are not, or only
partially be, required to protect the managing directors (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other
representatives) of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability from
the enforcement of the guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors shall, upon the Trustee’s
request, enter into good faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent
such provisions are, or are not required anymore to protect the managing directors
(Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) (or other representative’s) of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor(s) from the
risk of personal liability arising from the enforcement of the guarantee.’’

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Clause and any rights and/or obligations
arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.’’

_AG Limitation Language_

As a general rule, Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) prohibits the disbursement of the
deposits to the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenr¨uckgew¨ahr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) the relevant German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft)
may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the acquisition of the stock in
such German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Any agreement in such respect is void.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57 German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), it is standard
market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain
‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German public limited liability
company (Aktiengesellschaft). Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or
the security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German
subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of Section 57 German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Accordingly,
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents
relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will
contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could
lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes
Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. In particular, STADA, which, together with the other Guarantors,
provided a Senior Secured Notes Guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of

317


-----

the control date on March 20, 2018, is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German public limited
liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). As all the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are direct or indirect
subsidiaries of STADA, all limitations applicable to a German public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft) (whether by virtue of law or contractual limitation language) will consequently also
apply to such subsidiaries even if incorporated in a legal form other than a German public limited liability
company (Aktiengesellschaft). See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the Senior
_Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.’’_

The limitation language for any public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) incorporated into the
relevant Notes Documents, in particular in the security documents, is substantially in the form as follows:

(a) ‘‘Any guarantee or any liability, indemnity or other payment obligation (the ‘‘Guarantee’’) of a
Guarantor which is a public limited liability company under German law (Aktiengesellschaft) (an ‘‘AG
Guarantor’’) or by any Guarantor that is a subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall not be enforced to
the extent such Guarantee secures or relates to liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect
shareholders of that AG Guarantor or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such subsidiaries not to
include the AG Guarantor and the subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) if the relevant AG Guarantor
is not party to a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) as the dominated party with a direct shareholder as the dominating party._

(b) If a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- _und/oder_
_Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) is in force between the relevant AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder_
(with the direct shareholder as dominating party) any Guarantee granted by such AG Guarantor or by
any subsidiary of that AG Guarantor under this Agreement shall be enforceable except that it shall
not be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent (i) the payment by the AG Guarantor or by a
subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of those guarantees which secure liabilities which are owed
by direct or indirect shareholders of that AG Guarantor or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such
subsidiaries not to include the AG Guarantor and the subsidiaries which are also subsidiaries of that
AG Guarantor) will, or must be expected to, result in an annual loss to that AG Guarantor and
(ii) such annual loss would not be, or cannot be expected to be, compensated for by a compensation
claim under the relevant domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/
_oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) that can be accounted for in the balance sheet of that AG Guarantor at_
full value (vollwertig), unless the mere existence of a domination and/or profit and loss pooling
agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) between the relevant AG Guarantor
and a direct shareholder (with the direct shareholder as dominating party) leads to the inapplicability
of Section 57 sub section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in which case sub
paragraphs (i) and (ii) shall not be applicable and which shall be deemed to be the case if so explicitly
confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter dictum) by the Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) in a third party case.

(c) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor shall not be limited to
the extent any payment under the Guarantee demanded by a finance party from the relevant AG
Guarantor is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim
(vollwertiger Gegenleistungs oder R¨uckgew¨ahranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the affiliate whose
obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee and would therefore not lead to a violation of
Section 57 sub section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), unless this exception would
lead to a violation of Section 71a of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee granted by an AG
Guarantor or of any subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are
owed by that AG Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and
(b) above.

(e) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor or of any subsidiary of
that AG Guarantor shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and (b) above in an amount equal to the
amount drawn under the credit facilities (the ‘‘Drawn Amount’’) if and to the extent such Drawn
Amount is applied for the repayment, prepayment or other refinancing of any financial indebtedness
of such AG Guarantor or subsidiary of such AG Guarantor, provided that exception does not lead to a
violation of Section 57 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

318


-----

(f) The restrictions set out in paragraph (b) above do not affect the rights of the finance parties to claim
any outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent paragraph (b) above would
allow such claim at that later point.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall no further apply
from the date the AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as a public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft) unless such Guarantor is a subsidiary of another AG Guarantor in which case
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall apply in a way that the Guarantor shall be treated as a subsidiary of
that other AG Guarantor in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In such event, the limits
set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply to the Guarantee granted by that Guarantor in
respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.’’

Any guarantee, indemnity or upstream benefit granted under any Finance Document by STADA or any of
its subsidiaries in respect of liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s)
(upstream) or a Subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or indirect subsidiary of STADA)
(cross stream) will in any case take effect not earlier than immediately after the occurrence of the Control
Date (as defined under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’).

(h) German terms in this Clause (including any reference to German statutory provisions) shall be
construed in accordance with German law.’’

_General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect
to Sections 30, 31 and 64 sentence 3 GmbH and Sections 57, 71a and 92(2) sentence 3 the German Stock
Corporation Act (AktG)), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings
may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as
applicable, an AG, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German
Notes Guarantors to make payments on the Additional Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or
the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (i.e. the share pledges and any other
security interest) provided by the German Notes Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding ‘‘destructive interference’’ (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in
which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations)
may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the
German Notes Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement
process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of
contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the
debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners.
It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or any Senior Secured Notes Collateral by the German Notes
Guarantors (including in the legal form of an AG).

Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Additional Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a
repayment of the stated share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable,
(e.g., the enforcement of such guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable
under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this
could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing
the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores_
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to
collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured
claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not

319


-----

be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured
claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party to the
Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to benefit
from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for
the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its
own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular,
the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the
Additional Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Additional
Notes or the holders of the Additional Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the
pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law,
and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law.
Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be
restricted. In addition, holders of the Additional Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the
_Senior Secured Notes.’’_

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale
of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain
waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security
interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having
granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts
have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking)
in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right
to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other
creditors).

_Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the_
_Restructuring Directive_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that
debtor in possession proceedings have been ordered, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge
(anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors
and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance
periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings. On March 29, 2017, the German legislator passed an act for the
improvement of legal certainty concerning clawback pursuant to the German Insolvency Code and the
German Avoidance Act (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der
_Insolvenzordnung und nach dem Anfechtungsgesetz), which entered into force on April 5, 2017 (subject to_
certain transitional provisions). The amendments to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and
the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz) concern, inter alia, the provisions on avoidance for
intentionally disadvantaging third party creditors (Vorsatzanfechtung), cash transactions (Bargesch¨afte) and
interest accruing on avoidance claims.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to us, which would be based on and governed by the
insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Additional Notes as well as
the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Additional Notes could be
subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the
rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or
enforceability of the Additional Notes or any collateral in favor of the Additional Notes is challenged
successfully, the holder of the Additional Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Additional Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under the Additional
Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be
repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Additional Notes would only have a general
unsecured claim under the Additional Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases, as recently amended
by the act to improve legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under the German Insolvency Code

320


-----

and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach
_der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz) which became effective on April 5, 2017:_

(a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the
last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such
illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the
debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such
illiquidity or filing); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of
the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not
entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was
not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the
filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act
was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was
illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was
taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an affiliated
party shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other
creditors;

(c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at
the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such
time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the
counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the
transaction; whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the
debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings;

(e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice
the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such
knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that
the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or
enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled,
in which case such knowledge (solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was
illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting
an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which
such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings or at a time after the filing;

(f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an a related party
(nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged
unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities,
the term ‘related party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or
supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share

321


-----

capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information
about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members
of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

(g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a
shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision
of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of
satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for
shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest
and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a
creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity
for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and

(h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to
a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder B¨urge) (in which case the
shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Notes Guarantor) was unable to pay its
debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or
that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A
person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it
knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the
relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including
a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such
creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words ‘‘imminent
illiquidity’’ (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by ‘‘actual
illiquidity’’ (eingetretene Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement
(Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to,
the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the
illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a ‘‘related party,’’ there is a general
statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ Any amounts obtained from transactions that
have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third-party
financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing)
and shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including
reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall
not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020
and September 30, 2020 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.
This privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does
not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from
economically similar acts.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained an
enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a
levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the
payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz).
The conditions for avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the above
described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date
when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019,
the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the ‘‘Restructuring
Directive’’) has been adopted. The Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the

322


-----

European Union on June 26, 2019, and the member states have approximately two years to transpose the
substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one year
extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member
states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types
of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their
quality. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring
framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member
states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the Restructuring Directive need to be
transposed into national legislation, the Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion
regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides
for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan
by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where
applicable a majority by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency
restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings. The Restructuring Directive also
provides for cross class cram down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan
did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be
adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the Restructuring Directive provides for a
stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the
Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines,
regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a
criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to
such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and
receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30,
2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 and
where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.

**England and Wales**

Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (an ‘‘English Guarantor’’),
therefore any insolvency proceedings initiated by or against such Guarantors would likely be based on
English insolvency laws.

The United Kingdom, of which England forms a part, is a member of the European Union and, as such,
the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings will apply to any insolvency proceedings affecting the
English Guarantors. Pursuant to the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings, where a company
incorporated under English law has its centre of main interests (‘‘COMI’’) in England, the English courts
will have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company and any such
proceedings will be recognized and have effect throughout the European Union. If an English Guarantor
has its COMI in a member state of the European Union other than England and Wales, then the main
insolvency proceedings for that English Guarantor may be opened in the member state in which its COMI
is located and be subject to the laws of that member state. The point at which this issue falls to be
determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. In that case, the English
courts (or the courts of other parts of the United Kingdom) will only have jurisdiction to open secondary
insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors if they are found to have an establishment
in England and the effects of those proceedings will be limited to the assets of the English Guarantors
located in England.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross border Insolvency (the ‘‘Model Law’’) (which has been
implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross border Insolvency Regulations 2006), provides for
recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main or foreign non-main

323


-----

proceedings. English insolvency proceedings in relation to an English Guarantor may be recognized as
foreign main proceedings in other jurisdictions which have implemented the Model Law if the English
Guarantor has their respective COMI in England. If the English Guarantor is found to have its COMI in a
place other than England, the English insolvency proceedings may only be afforded recognition as foreign
non-main proceedings provided that the English Guarantor is found to have an establishment in England
(meaning that it has a place of operations in England and carries out non-transitory economic activities
with human means and assets or services). In that case, the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the
English Guarantor will occur in the place in which the English Guarantor is found to have its COMI.

To the extent that the Cross border Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation of the United
Kingdom under the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings, the requirements of the Recast
Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings will prevail.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar and, in the event that any English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is
not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by a company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, a company or the
holder of a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (discussed below) making an application for administration out of
court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up a company or a company resolving to do so (in the case
of a liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into
administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably
likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Insolvency Act’’), a company is insolvent if it is ‘‘unable
to pay its debts.’’ Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency Act, a company is deemed unable to pay its
debts in certain circumstances, including, among others, the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the
company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company
requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for three weeks thereafter failed to pay,
secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable
to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the
company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities.

The following description of the issues which may arise on an English insolvency is prepared on the
assumption that the English Guarantors are subject only to one insolvency proceeding which is governed
by English law and which has not been recognized in any other jurisdiction.

The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and
therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English company.

Moreover, it remains to be seen what impact the UK vote to leave the European Union will have on the
regulatory environment in the European Union and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU
law (including the Recast Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings) in the United Kingdom.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (a) an administrator
appointed to a company which granted the floating charge can dispose of floating charge assets for cash or
collect receivables charged by way of floating charge and use the proceeds and/or cash subject to a floating
charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging
company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a
fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may have
priority as against a floating charge over the same assets provided the floating charge has not crystallized at
the time the fixed charge is granted and the fixed charge holder had no notice of any restrictions applicable
to the creation of fixed charge security; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s
remuneration) properly incurred in a winding up are payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the
assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to
certain restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating
charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating

324


-----

charge security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) floating charge
security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme
contributions and salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to
employees) and, where the floating charge is not a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally,
security over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt
instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 as amended, to the
claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced amount of the proceeds.

With effect from April 6, 2020, and as a result of legislative changes introduced in Finance Bill 2019-2020
to amend section 386 and Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act 1986 and section 129 and Schedule 3 of the
Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016, and Article 346 and Schedule 4 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989, HM Revenue and Customs (‘‘HMRC’’) will constitute a preferential creditor of an insolvent
company in respect of certain amounts collected by the insolvent company on behalf of HMRC and will be
treated accordingly in the event of a company’s insolvency.

Searches made at the Registrar of Companies to ascertain what charges have been registered against the
English Guarantors are not conclusive as to whether any security interests exist over any assets of the
English Guarantors or the respective priorities of any security interests since (i) not all security interests
created by a company are required to be registered at the Registrar of Companies and (ii) a charge may
have been lodged with the Registrar of Companies, prior to the lodging of a security interest created by a
company at the Registrar of Companies but may not yet have been processed and may not therefore
appear on the company’s file.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security
interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have
the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the
proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the description given to the charges in the
relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the
secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a
fixed charge.

**_Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in
respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed ‘‘out of
court’’ (i.e., without the need for a court order) by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying
floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. Separately, the
security document may state that it gives the secured creditor the right to appoint an administrative
receiver.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which states that the relevant statutory provision (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act)
applies to it or which purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company (or to
make an appointment which would be the appointment of an administrative receiver). A creditor will be
the holder of a qualifying floating charge if it holds a floating charge or charges which relate to the whole
or substantially the whole of the English Guarantors’ property or charges and other form of security which
together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the English Guarantors’ property and at least one
such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating
charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the English Guarantors’ assets at the
time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

The most relevant exemption from the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exemption relating to capital markets arrangements. This exemption provides that the appointment of an
administrative receiver is permitted if it is to be made pursuant to an agreement which is or forms part of a
capital market arrangement under which a party incurs, or when the agreement was entered into was
expected to incur, a debt of at least £50,000,000 under the arrangement over its life and the arrangement
involves the issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment.’’

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the English Guarantors
would be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of realization of the English
Guarantors’ assets subject to the floating charge for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full

325


-----

provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the ‘‘Prescribed
Part’’). Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and
20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap, which was increased on April 6, 2020,
of £800,000 (although the maximum aggregate cap will remain £600,000 where the company’s net property
is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020).
The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to the creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any
shortfall claims of secured creditors. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other
security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Guarantors’ assets at the time that
the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at the time.

An administrator may dispose of or take any action in respect of any property of the English Guarantors
subject to a floating charge as if it were not subject to the charge, although the floating charge holder shall
have the same priority in respect of proceeds of the disposal. The administrator may also dispose of
property which is the subject of a fixed charge, subject to making an application to court and the court
finding that the disposal of the property would be likely to promote the purpose of the administration. Any
court order will be subject to a condition that the net proceeds of disposal of the property, and any
additional money required to be added to those net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by
the court to be the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, be
applied toward discharging the sums secured by the fixed charge.

**_Statutory Moratorium on Enforcement_**

If the English Guarantors were to go into administration under English law, the rights of the Trustee or
holders of the Senior Notes to institute any legal proceedings against the English Guarantors would be
restricted. There is a general moratorium on the enforcement of security and other legal process when a
company is in administration. No step may be taken by any person to enforce security over the property of
a company in administration without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.
Furthermore, prior to the appointment of an administrator, an interim moratorium will automatically arise
once an application to court to appoint an administrator has been lodged or notice of an intention to make
an appointment out of court has been given. However, if an administrative receiver has already been
appointed when the application for administration is made, the moratorium will only take effect when the
person by or on behalf of whom the administrative receiver was appointed consents to the making of the
administration order. Any previously appointed administrative receiver must vacate office upon an
administration order taking effect. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may
be appointed. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to enforce their security over
that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication
of the moratorium in relation to a security financial collateral agreement. To the extent that the English
Guarantors satisfy two or more of the requirements for being a ‘‘small company’’ under section 382 of the
Companies Act 2006, they may also be eligible for a moratorium if implementing a company voluntary
arrangement. Such a company will not, however, be eligible for such a moratorium if it falls within one of a
number of exemptions. The most relevant exemption is that relating to capital markets arrangements. This
exemption provides that a company is excluded from being eligible for a moratorium if, on the date of
filing, it is a party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital markets arrangement under which a
party has incurred, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least
£10,000,000 under the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital market
investment.’’

The making of a winding up order or the appointment of a provisional liquidator in respect of the English
Guarantors would have the effect of initiating a moratorium upon actions or proceedings against the
English Guarantors, although the moratorium would not prevent the enforcement of security or a
guarantee where this can be effected without the need for court intervention. If realizations from the
enforcement of the security exceed the value of the amounts secured, the excess would be required to be
paid over to the liquidator and would form part of the assets of the English Guarantors to be distributed by
the liquidator. To the extent that the security realized does not cover the whole of the secured amount, the
holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled to prove for the unsecured balance of those amounts
alongside unsecured creditors.

326

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s
liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Guarantor may be
able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which is liable
to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and has a ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to England and Wales could
also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the
second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in
England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents
have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case
will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise
or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights
of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are
given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 50% or
more by number and 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each
class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those
who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing
where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the scheme.

**_Grounds for Challenge of Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English Guarantor of
guarantees and security granted by an English company can be challenged. The following potential
grounds for challenge may apply under English law to the guarantee of the English Guarantor and the
security interests granted by an English company.

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of an English Guarantor could apply to the
court for an order to set aside a security interest (in certain cases) or a guarantee granted by the English
Guarantor (or give other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee
constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a
transaction at an undervalue if the transaction constitutes a gift or is made on terms that provide that the
English Guarantor receives no consideration or if the English Guarantor receives consideration of
significantly less value, in money or in money’s worth, than the consideration given by such English
Guarantor. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two
years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act). In addition the
English Guarantor must have been ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ at the time that it granted the guarantee or
security or became ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as a result. An English Guarantor will be ‘‘unable to pay its
debts’’ if a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the English Guarantor and remains unsatisfied for
three weeks or an execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a court in favor of a
creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the
English Guarantor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the English Guarantor’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). A
court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the English
Guarantor entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and
that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the
English Guarantor. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an
undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been
if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees
or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that
benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is

327


-----

for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts
unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a ‘‘connected person’’ (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in
which case there is a presumption that the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts and the
connected person must demonstrate that the English Guarantor was not unable to pay its debts at the time
of the transaction.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English Guarantor could apply to the
court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by such English Guarantor (or give
other relief) on the grounds such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. The grant of
a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or
guarantor of the English Guarantor) in a better position in the event of the English Guarantor’s insolvent
liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the
decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as
defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is
not a connected person or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court may not make an
order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the English Guarantor in deciding to
give the preference was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position. If the court
determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore
the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include
reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There is
protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith and for value. In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English Guarantor was unable
to pay its debts and that the English Guarantor was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a
presumption that the English Guarantor was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and
the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of an English Guarantor, or a person who is
a victim of the relevant transaction can apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or
guarantee granted by that English Guarantor on the grounds the security interest or guarantee was a
transaction defrauding creditors. A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a
transaction at an undervalue and the court is satisfied the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction
was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against it or to prejudice the interest of
such persons. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it
may make such order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or
protect the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside
the security interest or guarantees) but there is protection for a third party acting in good faith and for
value without notice of the relevant circumstances. Any ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction (with the leave of the
court if the English Guarantor is in liquidation or administration) may apply to court under this provision
and not just liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within
which the English Guarantor must enter insolvency proceedings and the relevant English Guarantor does
not need to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction.

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if an English Guarantor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a
result of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a liquidator
or administrator if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined
in section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986). The floating charge, however, will be validated to the extent of
the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or
goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Guarantor
at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts.
Where the floating charge is granted to a ‘‘connected person,’’ the charge can be challenged if given within
two years of the onset of insolvency and the prerequisite to challenge that the English Guarantor is unable
to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security financial collateral
arrangement,’’ the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

328


-----

_Extortionate Credit Transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The
court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company up to three years
before the day on which the English company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A
transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

_Priority of Claims_

One of the primary functions of administration and liquidation under English law is to realize the assets of
the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the
Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different
classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending
order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’ (see ‘‘—Administration,
_Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges’’ above), distributions cannot be made to a class of_
creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in_
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

_First ranking claims:_ holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets of
the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the assets
in which they have a proprietary interest;

_Second ranking claims:_ expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the
order of priority in which expenses are paid);

_Third ranking claims:_ preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed
by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes;
(ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a
maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. Secondary
preferential debts are currently limited to certain categories of bank account deposits. The UK government
has confirmed its intention in the Finance Bill 2020 that from December 1, 2020 secondary preferential
debts will include claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student
loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but
excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of
employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the
ordinary preferential debts. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention that these provisions will also
apply to Northern Ireland;

_Fourth ranking claims:_ holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This
would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but
which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset
realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined above) must be set aside for
distribution to unsecured creditors;

_Fifth ranking claims:_ unsecured creditors.

- firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured
shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

- secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the
official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration where consent has been given to make distributions. However,

329


-----

in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Senior Notes or the guarantees, such
interest due to the holders of the Senior Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

- thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This
however does not include ‘‘currency conversion’’ claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman
Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017;

_Sixth ranking claims:_ connected/associated creditors. Creditors whose claims are subordinated to the
payment of all of the insolvent company’s other creditors; and

_Seventh ranking claims:_ shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

_‘‘People with Significant Control’’ Regime_

Pursuant to Part 21A of the Companies Act 2006 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the Companies Act
2006), from April 6, 2016 certain UK incorporated companies, _societates europaeae and limited liability_
partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a relevant company) must keep a register of certain
registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable
individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the Companies
Act 2006 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of
that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the
purposes of Schedule 1B to the Companies Act 2006. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a
restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in
Schedule 1B to the Companies Act 2006, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of
(or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest;
(iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest holder;
and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in
respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect
the validity of the security interests over the security and the ability of the relevant secured parties to
enforce their rights under or in respect of the English security documents.

_Security Over Bank Accounts_

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by an English
company, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account Bank’’) may hold a
right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account Charge)
to exercise the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other
arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the
relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank accounts charged
under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed
charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the
relevant English company) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will
no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set off rights.

_Assignments_

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a
legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that
provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not
purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying
obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable
assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations,
including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent
legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest;
and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of
such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The

330


-----

first to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior
interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

_Security Over Shares_

A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are
registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest. Security over shares granted
by an English company or over shares of an English company are, under English law, equitable charges,
not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charger creates an encumbrance over the property in
favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable
charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

_Amendments_

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a
guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or
suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Security Documents_**

The English security documents are subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts. As discussed above,
the security documents may be reviewed and interpreted by courts in other jurisdictions if any of the
parties are subject to insolvency proceedings in those jurisdictions.

**_Filings_**

The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English company purports to
create security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should be delivered to the
Registrar of Companies within 21 days after the date of the security document in accordance with Chapter
A1 of Part 25 of the Companies Act 2006. Failing this, the security created by the security document will
(subject as mentioned in the above Chapter) be void against a liquidator or administrator and any creditor
of the charging company. The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the
application of the Financial Collateral Regulations (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003 No. 3226). In
addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in
section 859A(6) of the Companies Act 2006): (i) a charge in favor of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a
security in connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the
meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at
Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the Companies Act 2006 by or
under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009).
Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide
notice of a preexisting security interest for the purpose of priorities.

**_Currency Conversion_**

Under English insolvency law, any debt payable in a currency other than British sterling (such as Euro in
the case of the Senior Notes) must be converted into British sterling at the ‘‘official exchange rate’’
prevailing at the date when the debtor went into liquidation or, if the liquidation was immediately
preceded by an administration, on the date that the company entered administration. This provision
overrides any agreement between the parties. The ‘‘official exchange rate’’ for these purposes is the middle
market rate at the Bank of England as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published,
such rate as the court determines. Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantors go into liquidation
or administration, holders of the Senior Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that
the English Guarantors went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which
holders of Senior Notes may become entitled.

**_Interest in the Case of Under Collateralization_**

Under English law, a secured creditor’s entitlement to interest will, in the first instance, be determined by
what is provided for in the relevant debt instrument and related security documents. If that interest accrues
under such documents and the security is provided as security for all amounts owing under those

331


-----

documents, the secured creditor will be entitled to satisfy its claim for any interest accrued up to the date
of enforcement from the proceeds of enforcement of its security. If:

(a) those proceeds of enforcement are insufficient to satisfy the secured creditor’s claim in full (including
any accrued interest); or

(b) the secured creditor elects to surrender its security and prove for its claim as an unsecured creditor in
the debtor’s administration or liquidation,

the secured creditor will be entitled to prove for any amounts that remain outstanding (including accrued
interest) in accordance with the statutory regime, which applies to both administration and liquidation.
The statutory regime provides that creditors may prove for interest accrued up to the date of
administration or liquidation at the contractual rate.

In the case of both administration and liquidation, if there is any surplus available after the payment of all
debts proved, that surplus must be applied first towards the payment of interest on those proved debts in
respect of the period after the debtor entered administration or liquidation. Such interest claims rank
equally regardless of whether the debts to which they relate rank equally. Post administration or
liquidation interest is payable at the higher of the rate specified in section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 on
the date when the debtor entered administration or liquidation and the contractual rate.

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated in The Netherlands. Any insolvency
proceeding concerning such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor would likely be based on Dutch insolvency
law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also
be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not
incorporated under Dutch law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary
insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a
going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and
distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in
bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will
be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a
court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator
(bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft
composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments,
the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more
than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more
than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured nonpreferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if
there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if
there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike
Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors
are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under
Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce
their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were
no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that
does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the
court can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which

332


-----

can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by
secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition
(akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and
non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented
at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and
admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and
could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest
payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in
a composition.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the
aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and
payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The
general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the _paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which_
means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings
shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as
secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the
rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a
Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their
terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch Guarantor will be accelerated and become due
and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver
(curator) to be verified. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of
the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the
purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been
payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest
payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking
of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.
Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and
all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or
value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of
their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvooi proceedings
could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims.
As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered
to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple
majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in
amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed
by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of
classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential
creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro
rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency
proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ for a maximum of two months (which can be
extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors
are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge.
Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a
reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and
the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant.

333


-----

Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against
an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off
relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or
other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be
subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off.
Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can
be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy. See below ‘‘—Fraudulent Transfer.’’

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of
judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to
secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law.
Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds
resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors
under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors
have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically
stayed.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or
security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the
guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver
(curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment
proceedings (surseance van betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and
enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the
interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the
articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the
company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the
transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between
the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is
determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company
that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the
enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be
successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the
company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which
it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security
interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such
guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial
interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the
guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is
determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial
benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any
security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the
document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress
(bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment
pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an
insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness_
(redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off
(verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company
may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or
more of the shares in such company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled

334


-----

thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security
itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or
avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably
ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to
meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the
creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the
director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently
(voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security
Agent (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Additional Notes under or in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch share pledge will be
granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been
tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability of a Dutch share pledge posed by Dutch law.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch share pledge is successfully challenged, holders
of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a
Dutch share pledge. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a legal entity may, under
certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee or security interest was
granted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/
were prejudiced as a consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the
time the guarantee or security interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee or
security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security
interest knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security
interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all
creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is
presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be
prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing
requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply _mutatis mutandis when_
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may
challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation
to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or
(ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the
debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a
Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can
be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on
collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be
subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of
payments prior to obtaining title thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created,
in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private

335

limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not
constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any preexisting security.

**Republic of Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Ireland (‘‘RoI’’) and has its
registered office in Ireland (the ‘‘RoI Guarantor’’). Under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the RoI
Guarantor’s centre of main interest (‘‘COMI’’) is presumed to be the place of its registered office
(i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the RoI Guarantor did not move its
registered office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings.

As the RoI Guarantor’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of
the relevant RoI Guarantor would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might
constitute ‘‘proof to the contrary’’ regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in
Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ((2004) 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); (2006) IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); (2006)
Ch 508; ECJ Case C 341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in
the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference
from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that ‘‘factors which are both
objective and ascertainable by third parties’’ would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual
situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance,
if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut
the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office
in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent
undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

If the RoI Guarantor’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main
insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.

RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the RoI
Guarantors and any security interests granted by the RoI Guarantor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of RoI insolvency laws relating to certain limitations
on the Guarantees and security interests in respect of the Additional Notes, insofar as they are provided by
the RoI Guarantor.

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Additional Notes and limit any amounts
that you may receive. The STADA Group has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in RoI
which are commonly created in RoI over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Under RoI law, there are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating
charge security: (a) an examiner appointed to the charging company can deal with floating charge assets;
(b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the
floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s
remuneration) properly incurred in a winding up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the
assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating
charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to
give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;
(e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under Irish insolvency law (please see
‘‘—Challenges to Guarantees and Security—Grant of Floating Charge’’); and (f) floating charge security is
subject to the claims of preferential creditors in a winding up (such as certain taxes, salaries owed to
employees subject to a time limit and holiday pay owed to employees).

Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to
be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the
parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security
interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee

336


-----

has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the
proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor
is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court
is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it
may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the
assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold
that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.

**_Preferred Creditors Under RoI Law_**

Under Section 621 (Preferential Payments in a winding up) (‘‘Section 621’’) of the Companies Act 2014 (as
amended, the ‘‘Companies Act’’) in a winding up of an RoI company certain preferential debts are
required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts
therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company
available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are
required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the
Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from June 9, 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a
floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding up of that company,
even if that floating charge has crystallized. Under Section 440 (Preferential Payments when receiver
appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver
appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the
company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that
property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would
comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the
RoI Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee
related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of
employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation.

In addition, there is a further limited category of super preferential creditors which take priority, not only
over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These
super preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner
of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s
requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts, (see
‘‘—Examinership’’ below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company
by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE and VAT
arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created.

Furthermore, and as referred to above (see ‘‘—Fixed and Floating Charges’’), in the case of the application
of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a
winding up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of floating
chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.

**_Examinership_**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of the
whole or part of an RoI company the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of an
examiner and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.
In circumstances where an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the
directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of
that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one tenth of the paid up
voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an
examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate its survival (and all or part of its
undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the ROI company may be placed under the
protection of the relevant Irish court (the ‘‘Court’’) for a period of time whilst its affairs are investigated by
an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is capable of being rescued and to
supervise the restructuring process.

Where the Court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an
order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies Act to a related company
of such company. Once confirmed by the Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members

337


-----

and creditors. During the protection period the day to day business of the company remains under the
control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the Court.

Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme
of arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme of
arrangement will involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured, contingent
and actual) that are in existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the company of new
funds. The examiner has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company
after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company
prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject
of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the
holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders
of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. Having formulated his proposals, he must
convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors as he thinks proper to consider acceptance of
his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on the outcome of his meetings within 35 days of his
appointment, although the 35 day period can be extended by the Court. There is acceptance by creditors or
by a class of creditors when a majority in number representing a majority in value of the claims represented
at the meeting vote in favor of the proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court if they are to
become effective and the Court can confirm the proposals only if, inter alia: (a) at least one class of
creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals have accepted
them; (b) the Court is satisfied that the proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members
or creditors that has not accepted them and whose interests and claims would be impaired by
implementation; and (c) they are not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party.

Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether
secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may
be, affected by the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified.

For as long as a company is under the protection of the Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or
execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the
consent of the examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors and others) of
the Companies Act provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the examiner:

- where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance or
a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or income of the ROI
company, no action may be taken to realize the whole or any part of such security;

- no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the ROI company shall be appointed (and
if a receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to act); and

- no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for winding
up of the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect).

In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies Act,
no payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of satisfaction or
discharge of the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date upon which the
petition for the examiner’s appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s report under
Section 511 (Independent expert’s report) of the Companies Act that accompanied the petition
recommended that all or part of that liability be discharged or satisfied, or such payment is authorized by
the relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any interested party) where the relevant Irish
court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part that liability would considerably
reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as a going
concern.

Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be
under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending
70 days later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the
examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as the
Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s
final report). In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further
extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal.

338


-----

Furthermore, the Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed
by the Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the
related contract amounted to an unfair preference.

**_Primary Risks for Holders of Notes in an Examinership_**

The primary risks to the holders of the Additional Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if an examiner were
appointed to the RoI Guarantor and/or to a company related to such an RoI company and where any
amounts due under the Additional Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there may be a delay in enforcing
the payment obligations of the RoI Guarantor in respect of the Additional Notes and of any payment
obligations contained in a guarantee given by any other related company subject to the examinership
proceedings; (b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the
writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the RoI Guarantor to the holders of the Additional Notes;
(c) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down
or rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the Additional Notes by a company
related to such RoI Guarantor; (d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge
prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the RoI Guarantor to enable the
examiner to borrow to fund the guarantor or issuer during the protection period; and (e) in the event that
a scheme of arrangement is not approved in respect of an RoI company guarantor of the Additional Notes
and the guarantor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses
(including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the guarantor and approved by the
RoI High Court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may
become due, owing or payable by it to the holders of the Additional Notes.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under RoI insolvency law in which the granting by an RoI company of security
and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is
appointed to the RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of
the security or giving of the guarantee and, in addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when
the security interest was granted or when the guarantee was given or ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ within the
meaning of the Companies Act as a result.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees:

_Unfair Preference_

Under Irish insolvency law, if an ROI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to
have certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604
(Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the Companies Act
(‘‘Section 604’’) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other
act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they
become due in favor of any creditor of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a
view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over
the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid
accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within six months of the doing of the act and the
company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to pay its debts (taking into account
contingent and prospective liabilities).

_Improperly Transferred Assets_

Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred)
of the Companies Act (‘‘Section 608’’), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or
contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any
property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or
mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to ‘‘perpetrate a fraud’’ on the company, its creditors or
members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to
have ‘‘use, control or possession’’ of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development
of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the
High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets has been extended to

339


-----

receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair
preference for the purposes of Section 604.

_Disclaimer of Onerous Contracts_

Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the Companies
Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the
company. ‘‘Onerous property’’ is defined to include any ‘‘unprofitable contract’’ and ‘‘any other property
(of the company) which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to
the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.’’

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating
charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favor of a ‘‘connected
person’’) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be
proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not
apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied
to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with
interest at the appropriate rate.

_General_

If the RoI Guarantor becomes subject to an RoI law insolvency proceeding and that company has
obligations to creditors that are treated under RoI law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to
the noteholders, the noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such
insolvency proceeding.

The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis that it is
prohibited under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and
unenforceable. Further, guarantees by the Irish guarantors for the obligations of another group company
must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish guarantors. If the giving of a
guarantee is not for the Irish guarantors’ corporate benefit, the guarantees could be held null and void.
The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case by case basis and consideration has to be given
to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is
particularly relevant for upstream or cross stream guarantees. The question whether or not the corporate
benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the
company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If
the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the
company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantees could be declared
null and void. The validity and/or enforceability of the guarantees may also be subject to the statutes of
limitations, defenses such as set off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of
estoppel, and the fact that equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion.

Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the
Companies Act (‘‘Section 82’’), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and
whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for
the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for
any shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the Additional Notes may only be
guaranteed by the relevant ROI company to the extent that it would not result in such guarantee
constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82.

Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book
debts of an RoI tax resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners to
pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by
the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI Revenue Commissioners of
the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of
certain outstanding RoI tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax)
arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners.

340


-----

The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax resident company by another
person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the
liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of
the RoI Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating)
over the debt in question.

**Northern Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Northern Ireland (the ‘‘NI
Guarantor’’). Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the NI Guarantor are likely to be governed
by the laws of Northern Ireland. Insolvency laws in Northern Ireland may not be as favorable to your
interests as the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Where the NI
Guarantor experiences financial difficulties, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
insolvency or similar proceedings.

Northern Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided
by the NI Guarantor and any security interests granted by the NI Guarantor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Northern Irish insolvency laws relating to certain
limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests in respect of the Additional
Notes, insofar as they are provided by the NI Guarantor.

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Additional Notes and limit
any amounts that you may receive. The Group has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in
Northern Ireland which are commonly created in Northern Ireland over a company’s assets, namely fixed
and floating charges.

**_General_**

The laws relating to insolvency and the validity/enforceability of guarantees and security are broadly the
same as those in England and Wales but substantially different from those equivalent laws in the Republic
of Ireland.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Northern Irish company should be commenced
in Northern Ireland based on Northern Irish insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of
Northern Irish companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances. Formal
insolvency proceedings under the laws of Northern Ireland may be initiated in a number of ways, including
by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application to the High Court
for administration, (ii) the company, its directors, or a qualifying floating chargeholder appointing
administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor or the directors of the company filing a petition to wind up a
Northern Irish company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation).

A Northern Irish company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into
administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably
likely to achieve one of the three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended), a company is deemed to be unable to
pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is
unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a ‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt
(or similar court order).

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can (without the floating charge holder’s consent)
convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet
administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging
company) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge,

341


-----

even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the
charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of a liquidator) properly
incurred in a winding up are payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets the
subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security
crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the
ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging
company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise
to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) there are
particular challenges / risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating charge security is subject
to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and wages/
salaries (including holiday pay) owed to employees) and to ring fencing (see below ‘‘—Administration and
_Floating Charges’’)._

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed
security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges
because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on
whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in
the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in
practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the
court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding
that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended by the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order
2005 and as otherwise amended) empowers courts in Northern Ireland to make an administration order in
respect of a Northern Irish company in certain circumstances.

An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to
become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order
1989 (as amended) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the statutory purpose
of administration.

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a
qualifying floating charge which has become enforceable. During the administration, no proceedings or
other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company in administration, or security
enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator
(the statutory moratorium). Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their
security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium.

In England and Wales the statutory moratorium does not apply to security interests created or arising
under a ‘‘financial collateral agreement’’ (generally, security/collateral in respect of cash or financial
instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the ‘‘2003 Regulations’’).

The 2003 Regulations were implemented at a time when the Enterprise Act 2002 was in force in England
and Wales; however the equivalent provisions in Northern Ireland were not introduced until the Insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 2005 (the ‘‘2005 Order’’) came into force. The 2005 Order introduced Schedule
B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and replaced Part III of the Insolvency (Northern
Ireland) Order 1989 which the 2003 Regulations had amended as far as financial collateral arrangements
were concerned. Following this, the Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality and Financial
Collateral Arrangements) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (the ‘‘2010 Regulations’’) reflected the changes
brought about to the administration regime in Northern Ireland, as a consequence of the implementation
of the 2005 Order.

However, there appears to be one omission, which is the failure of the 2010 Regulations to disable the
effect of Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, in relation to a
receiver appointed pursuant to a financial collateral arrangement.

Therefore, if a Northern Irish company were to enter administration, it is possible that the security or the
guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or
consent of the administrator. In addition, as stated above, Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the

342


-----

Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 has not been disapplied by the 2003 Regulations or the 2010
Regulations. Accordingly, there is a risk that any receiver appointed over an asset of a Northern Irish
company under a financial collateral arrangement may be required to vacate office by an administrator of
that entity if an administrator was appointed pursuant to the laws of Northern Ireland.

There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain this leave of court or consent of the
administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be
appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed receiver
must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no
other receiver may be appointed over that company’s fixed assets (commonly referred to as a fixed charge
receiver) without the leave of a court of a competent jurisdiction in Northern Ireland (the ‘‘Northern Irish
Court’’) or the administrator’s consent.

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the
company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Northern Irish obligor must constitute a ‘‘qualifying
floating charge’’ for the purposes of Northern Irish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint
an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates
March 27, 2006, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as
amended) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a
qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the
relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator
of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the
meaning given by Article 5(1) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). The
Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if
necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the
relevant Northern Irish obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating
charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is
the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989, as amended), which will apply if a Northern Irish obligor creates a debt of at least £50,000,000
for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a
‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as
amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver or
liquidator of the company will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of
enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses
(floating charge realizations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to
50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a
maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other
security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant Northern Irish obligor’s assets at the time
that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

**_Liquidation_**

The NI Guarantor may be wound up under the laws of Northern Ireland. This means that the NI
Guarantor would be placed into either creditors’ voluntary liquidation or compulsory liquidation, both of
which are insolvent liquidations. The NI Guarantor is not referring to the process of Members’ voluntary
liquidation which is a solvent winding up and outside the scope of this analysis.

On the liquidation of a Northern Irish company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place
preventing, amongst other things, the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those
security interests. Where the NI Guarantor is placed into creditors’ voluntary liquidation, there are no
restrictions on the holder of security either by way of fixed or floating charge from taking steps to enforce
those security interests unless the liquidator or any creditor has applied to a court for a stay. However,
where the NI Guarantor is placed into compulsory liquidation, the consent of a Northern Irish Court is
strictly required before any security interest can be enforced and a court order would be required to place
the company into administration. In addition, with compulsory liquidation where the obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are unsecured because of some inherent defect in the security interest,
that guarantor cannot take action or commence proceedings to recover the amounts due on foot of the
guarantee without the consent of a Northern Irish Court by virtue of Article 110(3) of the Insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended).

343

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under Northern Irish insolvency law in which the granting by a Northern Irish
company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the Northern
Irish company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the
guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed
to a Northern Irish company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or
guarantee given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Northern Irish law to guarantees and
security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could
apply to a Northern Irish Court for an Order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee
if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee
constituted a gift or transfer for no or significantly less consideration. There will only be a transaction at an
undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the Northern Irish company
was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989). The transaction is subject to potential challenge if the Northern Irish company enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Northern Irish
company grants the security interest or guarantee. However, a Northern Irish Court generally will not
intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business
and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the
company. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot assure holders of the Additional Notes that in the event
of insolvency, the granting of the security by the NI Guarantor would not be challenged by a liquidator or
administrator or that a court would support the analysis that (in any event) the guarantee was entered into
in good faith for the purposes described above. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction
was a transaction at an undervalue, a Northern Irish Court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore
the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings,
it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent
unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern
Ireland) Order 1989, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected
person must demonstrate the solvency of the Northern Irish company in such proceedings to rebut such a
presumption.

_Preference_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could
apply to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if
such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee
constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into,
the Northern Irish company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989, as amended) or the Northern Irish company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) as a consequence of its entry into the transaction.
The transaction can be challenged if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the Northern Irish
company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Northern Irish
company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the
event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would
otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If a Northern Irish Court determines
that the transaction constituted such a preference, a Northern Irish Court has very wide powers for
restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this
case, include reducing payments under the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees
(although there is protection for a third party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and
without notice). However, for a Northern Irish Court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the
preference the Northern Irish company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In

344


-----

any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company
was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is
a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the
connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and
was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which
that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. An application to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the transaction
may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of
being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of a Northern Irish Court in the case of a company
in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time
limit in the Northern Irish insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant
company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If a Northern Irish Court determines
that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, a Northern Irish Court can make such orders as
it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into
and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the
transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was
acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and
will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Avoidance of Floating Charge_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, if a Northern Irish company is unable to pay its debts at the time of
(or as a result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified
period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the value of the
money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
Northern Irish company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge.

The requirement for the Northern Irish company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting
the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the
floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified
period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
Northern Irish company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the
relevant Northern Irish company is solvent or insolvent.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant Northern Irish company enters
into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant
Northern Irish company grants the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security
financial collateral agreement’’ under the 2003 Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to
challenge as described in this paragraph.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

To the extent any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is organized under the laws of Belgium (a ‘‘Belgian
Guarantor’’), and provided Belgium is the territory in which the centre of such Belgian Guarantor’s main
interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. The above also applies to
any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the centre of such debtor’s main interests is situated.
Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also
allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose centre of main

345


-----

interests is not situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian
insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial
reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/r´eorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings
(faillissement/faillite).

Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX ‘‘Insolvency of enterprises’’ of the Belgian
Code of Economic Law (the ‘‘Belgian Insolvency Act’’).

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may
file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately
or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital
(maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A
state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not
issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the
debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period
between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets
may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such
creditors may hold with respect to such assets.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the
court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the
satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open,
allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of
the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report
issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve months as
from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the
business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of
the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months.

The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting
claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable
assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions.
During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. During the
moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself
and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a
material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of
moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be
continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the
receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The
holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the
initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on
financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the
‘‘Belgian Financial Collateral Act’’), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced
notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of
right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of
payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in
favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium,
nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of
guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the
debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of
the enterprise.

346


-----

During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor
continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court.
However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator
(ondernemingsbemiddelaar/m´ediateur d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or
its activities. In addition, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of
manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the
enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such
continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice).
Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court may
replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) for the
duration of the moratorium.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions
which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a
reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable
during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close out netting
provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a
public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or
financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act
provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior
to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15 day period following the
notification of such default after granting of the moratorium.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract
during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is
necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part
of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the
performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the
ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between
the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the
activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the
position of the court and/or third parties.

In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The
debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation
to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will
record it. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without
disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have
agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan
during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling
of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization plan must be
filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in
advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the
reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the
creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including
those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can
be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their individual consent. The court
may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan
violates public policy.

To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the
ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors
individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well
as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with preexisting claims, as well as any
other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the
secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of

347


-----

such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court
can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its
decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has
not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which
the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain
unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the
reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be
based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its
petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or
by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can
order such transfer in specific circumstances.

The court ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire
de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to
the transfer price, subject to some limited exceptions.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the
public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the
debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ opened in another EU Member State
(other than Denmark) in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that
the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must
be submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/d´eclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a
situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de
_paiements de mani`ere persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/_
_´ebranlement de cr´edit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to_
pay its debts as they fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy,
the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business.
The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation
of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to
creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being
informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may
oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued
operation of the business.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or
several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not
impair any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an
ongoing contract may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the
15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed
to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue
performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the
fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, in which case its claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors.

The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the
authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However,
two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes
an early termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an_
essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy

348


-----

judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can
agree to continue to perform under such contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the
court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee
may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a
pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the
period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension
period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a
specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of
the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those
secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is
necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at
its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue
the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend
such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension
will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has
been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash
held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an
insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such
security shall, in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such
insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on
its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The
debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The
following is a general overview of only the main principles:

- _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the_
so called ‘‘estate debts,’’ have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the
realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of
the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

- _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset_
(whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

- _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims_
for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of
the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests.

- _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security_
interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by
the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank _pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be_
subordinated).

- Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_COVID-19—Temporary Moratorium_**

In the framework of the Covid-19 crisis, the Belgian federal government has introduced a statutory
temporary moratorium (the ‘‘Moratorium’’) pursuant to the Royal Decree dated April 24, 2020.

The Moratorium applies to any business whose continuity is threatened by the Covid-19 crisis and its
consequence; provided that the business was not already in cessation of payments on or before March 18,
2020. Businesses automatically benefit from the Moratorium. However, an interested party (e.g. creditor or
competitor) may challenge the Moratorium’s application if it considers that a business is not eligible for
the Moratorium (as, for example, it was in cessation of payments before March 18, 2020 or is not impacted
by the Covid-19 crisis).

349


-----

The Moratorium applies until and including May 17, 2020 or such later date as determined by a
government decision.

- During the Moratorium, businesses cannot be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Nor can a
transfer of undertaking be forced upon a business. In addition, the obligation for a business to file for
bankruptcy is suspended for the duration of the Moratorium if the bankruptcy conditions result from
the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

- During the Moratorium, preventive and executory attachments cannot be levied or enforced in
relation to certain assets (not including, among others, immovable property and financial collateral
within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act). This protection against attachment covers
debts predating and arising during the Moratorium.

- The Moratorium is without prejudice to the principle that due debts should be paid.

- Any (contractual) ground providing for the right unilaterally to dissolve an agreement on the grounds
of non-payment of a monetary debt due and payable under the agreement is expressly suspended for
the duration of the Moratorium. Express dissolution clauses that are triggered in the event of
non-payment will as such not be enforceable. The Moratorium does not affect contractual remedies
other than termination. Thus remedies such as the defense of non-performance, set-off and retention
rights remain available throughout the Moratorium.

- The Belgian Financial Collateral Act remains applicable during the Moratorium.

**_Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Senior Notes Collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another
group company must fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate
benefit of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate
benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal
authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or
collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is
only limited case law on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case by case basis by reference to the
prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that
the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross
stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be
proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the
guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial
capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the
individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of
directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors
will be subject to only a ‘‘marginal review’’ by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can
be expected to take a more critical view.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil
law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under
criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as ‘‘abuse of
company goods’’ (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or
security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that
benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is
not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could
be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested
under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is
standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain
‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the
Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is,
however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit.

350


-----

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate
purpose and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any guarantee granted by a Belgian Guarantor shall not include and shall not extend to cover any payment
obligation in respect of the proceeds of the Additional Notes arising out of amounts used to fund directly
or indirectly the acquisition of shares of such Belgian Guarantor to the extent that by assuming such
obligation the Belgian Guarantor would be deemed to be providing prohibited financial assistance to the
acquisition of its own shares or capital participations, as prohibited under Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the
Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to time.
Therefore, such payment obligations shall be excluded from the concept of guarantee by a Belgian
Guarantor. Any guarantees or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitute a breach
of the provisions on financial assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of
Companies and Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to time, are not enforceable.

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
certain transactions that have been concluded or performed by the debtor during the so called ‘‘hardening
period.’’

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed
to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may
determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an
earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order,
except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six
months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its
creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration
of bankruptcy is referred to as the ‘‘hardening period’’ (verdachte periode/p´eriode suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective
against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an
undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and
(iv) security interests provided for preexisting debts (save for any security granted during the suspension
period of judicial reorganization proceedings).

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an
undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian
Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure preexisting debts.

If the guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on
the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an obligation
to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security
interests.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court
ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that
the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as
an existing creditor (actio pauliana).

Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be
declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the
deed and the date of registration.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the
creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or
guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or
conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal
provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which
they may review.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the Additional Notes and/or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees offered hereby._

The Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof (together, the ‘‘Securities’’) have
not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United
States or to U.S. persons unless the Securities are registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable
jurisdiction is available. Accordingly, the Securities are being offered and sold only (i) to qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A, ‘‘QIBs’’) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the
United States to non-U.S. persons in an offshore transaction (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in
reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Securities under the Securities Act and, therefore, the
Securities may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Securities to the Initial
Purchasers for re offer and resale only:

United Kingdom, are not retail investors, each defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

We use the terms ‘‘U.S. person,’’ ‘‘offshore transaction’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (ii) the Securities may not be offered, sold
or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is either (a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account

States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Group, the Initial Purchasers, or

the offer or sale of any Securities, other than the information contained in or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and
upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It has had
access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed
necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to
ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that
neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum or the
information incorporated by reference herein;

(4) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises
sole investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for

Securities offered to QIBs, one year after the later of the original issue date of such Securities, the
original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last date on which the issuer or

later of the original issue date of such Security and the date on which such Security (or any
predecessor of such Security) was first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in
Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S only (a) to the Issuers, the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been
declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as such Security is eligible for resale

non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to compliance
with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further
subject to the issuer’s right prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (e) to require
the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to it, including

(8) it acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any
Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Registrar that
the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

(9) it acknowledges that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of its
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its
purchase of the Securities are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is
acquiring any Securities as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it
has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to
make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each
such investor account; and

(10) it understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of
the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and ‘‘Plan
_of Distribution.’’_

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers
have agreed to purchase from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Additional Notes. The sale of the Additional Notes will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering
memorandum (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase the Additional Notes from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are several and not joint. The
Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Additional Notes if they
purchase any of the Additional Notes.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Additional Notes for resale at the issue price that
appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may
change the price at which the Additional Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without
notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Additional Notes through certain of their affiliates,
including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a
U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Additional Notes in the United States, it will
do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel
or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase the Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to
the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their
services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of Additional Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions
by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase
commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering
may be terminated.

Certain of the Sponsors or their affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Additional
Notes at a purchase price per Additional Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this
offering memorandum, subject to a pass through of the Initial Purchasers’ discount in respect of the
Additional Notes purchased by such persons.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers
may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are
substantially similar to the Additional Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement
through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written
consent of Citigroup Global Markets Limited.

The Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered
under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance
on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the New
Issue Date of the Additional Notes, an offer or sale of the Additional Notes initially sold in reliance on
Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Additional Notes are restricted as described under ‘‘Notice to
_Certain Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’_

355


-----

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Additional Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Additional Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Additional Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Additional
Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any
other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Additional Notes may be distributed or
published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and
regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to
sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be
unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Additional Notes, the
distribution of this offering memorandum and the resale of the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Transfer
_Restrictions.’’_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such
offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and
sale of the Additional Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will apply, through their listing agent, for the listing of and permission to
deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the
Additional Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of
the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the
limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘Exchange
Act’’). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, that it will
be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Additional Notes at a particular time or at a
price which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes and the
_Senior Secured Notes—Transfer of the Additional Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value_
_of the Additional Notes.’’_

Under Rule 15c6 1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in
two business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the Exchange Act) unless the parties
to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the A200.0 aggregate amount of the
Additional Notes will be made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this
offering memorandum, which will be business days following the date of pricing of
the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + ‘‘).
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Additional Notes on the date of this offering
memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Additional Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing
transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids
do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Additional Notes in
the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids

356


-----

permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Additional
Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover
short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Additional Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over
allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Additional Notes in
the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and
purchase Additional Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations
and may impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the
Additional Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required
to engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer of the Additional Notes will be restricted,_
_which may adversely affect the value of the Additional Notes.’’_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Additional
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may
begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the
Additional Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the
Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days
after the date of issuance of the Additional Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Additional Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently
providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking,
various lending, hedging, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under
bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or
may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Additional Notes. In addition, J.P. Morgan Limited, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
London Branch, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, ING Bank NA., a branch of ING DiBa AG,
Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Citibank N.A. London, Jefferies Finance Europe,
SCSp, Nomura Bank International plc, UBS AG, London Branch, UBS Europe SE (as successor in title to
UBS Limited), Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and Soci´et´e G´en´erale S.A. Frankfurt Branch or their
respective affiliates are acting as mandated lead arrangers and original lenders, as applicable, under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Barclays Bank PLC is acting as agent under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may act as counterparties in
hedging arrangements. Soci´et´e G´en´erale (or one of its affiliates) provides lending services to STADA
under various local facilities. In connection with their services in such capacities, the Initial Purchasers
have received, or will receive, customary fees.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours
or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our securities, including potentially the Additional Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Additional Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**Germany**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are incorporated
under the laws of Germany. Our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. Virtually
all of our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the United States.
As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture governing the Additional Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or
us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil
liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities
laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in
U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have
a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration
awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on
the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for
payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment
by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before
a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in
section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did
not have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign
court which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a
proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtsh¨angig) before a German court before the U.S.
federal or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German
law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Additional Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case
law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to
assets (verm¨ogensrechtliche Anspr¨uche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you
that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S.
federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as
incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as
being of a penal or punitive nature.

358


-----

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to
trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial
discovery process exists under German law.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on
the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of
November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to
infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental
principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German
Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in
2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for
punitive damages.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in
the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such
U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent
jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually
be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it).
Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without
proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an
action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that
the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction
according to the rules of English private international law);

- the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable
in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human
Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent
applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or
in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or
revenue law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or
substantial justice;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or
other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior
inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention member state of the European Union or a
Member State which the English Court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention
Choice of Court Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the
Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007;

359


-----

- the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.;

- the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court;
and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is
questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings
were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England
and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar
proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.
Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that
could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject
of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**The Netherlands**

Centrafarm B.V. is incorporated under Dutch law (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantor’’). As a result, it may be difficult
for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantor.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court
in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal
securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to
obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a
competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the courts of The Netherlands may be expected to render
a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a
final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction vis `a vis the Dutch
Guarantor on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in
violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the public policy (openbare orde) of
The Netherlands and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a
dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered in a dispute
between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action,
provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in The Netherlands.

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement
and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of
the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Republic of Ireland**

As the United States is not a party to a convention with the Republic of Ireland in respect of the
enforcement of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the
courts of the State of New York is enforceable in the Republic of Ireland. A judgment of the courts of the
State of New York will be enforced by the courts of the RoI if the following general requirements are met:

(i) the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant
according to the Republic of Ireland conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the
defendant would satisfy this rule); and

(ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court
which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if
an appeal is pending. Where however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to
stay execution of the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be
actionable in the Republic of Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in
default of appearance is final and conclusive.

360


-----

However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York which
meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:

(iii) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;

(iv) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;

(v) the enforcement of the judgment in the Republic of Ireland would be contrary to natural or
constitutional justice;

(vi) the judgment is contrary to the Republic of Ireland public policy or involves certain United States laws
which will not be enforced in the Republic of Ireland; or

(vii) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement
proceedings by personal service in the Republic of Ireland or outside the Republic of Ireland under
Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of November 22, 1996, as amended by
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 (the ‘‘Blocking Statute’’), no judgment of a court or
tribunal and no decision of an administrative authority located outside of the European Union giving
effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex to the Blocking Statute or to actions based
thereon will be recognized or be enforceable in any manner by the courts of the Republic of Ireland.

**Northern Ireland**

The United States and the UK do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the UK are
both parties to the New York Convention on Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary
judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law
action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in
this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to the matters identified below)
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if:

- the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of
private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and

- the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum
payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or
otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other
public law).

- Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established
that:

- the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in
Northern Ireland;

- the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount
of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

- the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period;

- before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of
a final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is
enforceable in Northern Ireland;

- the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice
were breached;

- the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction
the judgment debtor did not submit); or

361


-----

- an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments
(Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S.
court.

If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish
judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or
becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

**Belgium**

In the absence of any bilateral or multilateral treaty, a final and enforceable judgment of the courts
exercising jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Belgium
without review on the merits subject to the conditions specified in Articles 22 to 25 of the Belgian Code of
Private International Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Priv´e).

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be
produced in court by the claimant:

- an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/exp´edition de la d´ecision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

- if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the
originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law;
and

- any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and
has been notified to the defendant.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the
Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if:

- the rights of defense have been violated;

- such recognition or enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy;

- the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets
without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state;

- the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement
could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable
laws;

- if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been
sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance
with Belgian private international law;

- the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending
between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter;

- the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in
another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium;

- Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or

- the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in
relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In
Belgium the procedural rules set out in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of
Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by United
States courts is sought in Belgium.

In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign
court decisions in Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable
by the debtor, if the sum of money that the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court, or by a foreign
court judgment that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered
enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds A12,500.

**Notes**

**General Information**

**1. Corporate information**

Nidda German Topco GmbH (formerly Blitz 17-89 GmbH) as the parent company of the Nidda Group
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘Nidda Group’’ or ‘‘Group’’), with business address, c/o STADA Arzneimittel
AG, Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is a Germany-based company. The operating activities comprise
the management of its own assets as well as the acquisition, sale, holding and management of investments
in other companies which are active in the healthcare market both in Germany and abroad. Nidda German
Topco GmbH also provides services for Group companies particularly in the areas of Corporate HR and
Corporate Finance.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH for financial year 2019 were
approved for publication by the Management Board on March 11, 2020.

**2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements**

The Consolidated Financial Statements prepared for Nidda German Topco GmbH as parent company as
of December 31, 2019, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union
(EU) as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the
German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies
included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or non-current distinction.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
Notes are shown in euro thousands (k A). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2019, Nidda observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to
pronouncements published by the IASB and adopted by the EU which were first applicable as of
January 1, 2019. The following changes had effects on the presentation of Nidda’s net assets, financial
position and results of operations and cash flow:

In January 2016, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’, which determines the
recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (liabilities) associated with leases in the balance
sheet for lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating leases.
IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is
permitted. STADA applied the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and was modified
retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures was waived. In this context, the rights of use were
equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change.

The amortized cost of the right of use is calculated as the present value of future lease payments, initial
direct costs as well as the estimated costs that would arise in the course of the disassembly and removal or
restoration of the leasing object. Leasing incentives received are deducted. Use is made of the option to
consider non-leasing components generally as leasing payments. First-time application of the leasing
liabilities is carried out at the amortized cost of the lease liability to be paid. In subsequent measurement,
the leasing liabilities are compounded and reduced by the leasing payments made. Liabilities from finance
leases, which were already recognised under IAS 17, were not revalued at the date of first-time application

of IFRS 16 and were therefore carried at their corresponding carrying amount (A5.3 million) as of
January 1, 2019.

Use is made of the option granted by IFRS 16 to waive application of a right of use and the leasing liability
for (short-term) leases with a term of up to twelve months or for leases of low-value assets. The option of
grandfathering was not used. Consequently, IFRS 16 was applied on January 1, 2019 to all existing
contracts that fall within its scope.

In the transition to IFRS 16, current findings in the determination of the terms of leases with extension
and termination options have been incorporated. For the measurement of the right of use, the initial direct
costs at the time of initial application were not taken into account.

As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance sheet, as required by IFRS 16, a
significant increase in the balance sheet total in the amount of A59.0 million and a corresponding increase
in current and non-current leasing liabilities occurred which are reported in the balance sheet item other
financial liabilities. The difference between the other financial obligations from leases as of December 31,
2018 in the amount of A43.9 million, which were discounted at the incremental borrowing rate, and the
leasing liabilities reported in the balance sheet at the time of the initial application of IFRS 16 as of
January 1, 2019, results primarily through the evaluation to be made in accordance with IFRS 16 on the
exercise of termination and extension options as well as the evaluation on January 1, 2019 of leases that are
to be identified and, consequently, to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16.

Instead of leasing expenses for operating leases, as a result of the changes from IFRS 16, future
depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a
corresponding impact on the EBITDA. Depreciation and amortization for these leasing contracts
amounted to A23.9 million in financial year 2019. In addition, there were reported interest expenses in the
amount of A3.3 million in the reporting period. In financial year 2018, In accordance with the requirements
of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’ that were to be applied in the previous year, these expenses were fully recognized in
operating profit as a leasing expense and as a reduction of EBITDA. In addition, there were payments in
connection with leases in accordance with IFRS 16 amounting to A26.3 million, which are now fully
reflected in the cash flow from financing activities.

The changeover effect relates at STADA for the most part to leased real estate and company vehicles.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued)**

**The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB:**

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are
expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

There were no changes to accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of net
assets, financial position and results of operations or cash flow in financial year 2019, other than the
previously-mentioned effects from the application of the new standard IFRS 16.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Nidda German
Topco GmbH and are therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if Nidda German Topco GmbH or its
subsidiaries are in control of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over
existing rights, are able to substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually
substantiated by a share of voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which Nidda German Topco GmbH can have significant direct or indirect
influence and are not subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements using the equity method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net
assets, financial position and results of operations of the Nidda Group is insignificant, are not consolidated
or accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for at amortized
cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet total of these companies make up
about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates included in financial year 2019 and are as follows:

In the reporting year, the merger of the Swiss parent company Pegach AG to Spirig HealthCare AG was

In December 2019, initial consolidation was carried out for three acquired Ukranian subsidiaries,

PharmTechService LLC.

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full—
irrespective of the amount of the share holding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the

**Notes (Continued)**

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (Continued)**

historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the
acquiree, Nidda recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the
period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a
revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares
of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
through other coprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, because it is a transaction between the
equity investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between
the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value
adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the
IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when
joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and
carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A
positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the
carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the
period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of Nidda German Topco GmbH is the euro and corresponds to the reporting
currency of the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing
rate and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the
resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the
period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in
equity in the ‘‘Provisions for currency translation’’. These provisions are released and recognized in income
if Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

**8. Business combinations**

In financial year 2019, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for
which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in greater detail below.

**Achievement of control over the Ukrainian Biopharma Group**

As of December 20, 2019, STADA obtained control over the Ukrainian Biopharma Group, Bila Tserkva.
The company markets prescription pharmaceuticals and consumer health products. The Biopharma Group
has been included as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements from December 31, 2019. The
purchase price for the acquisition in the amount of A49.4 million was paid entirely in cash.

The preliminary purchase price allocation, which had not yet been completed at the time of publication of
the Annual Report, resulted in an indicative allocation that approximately 80% of the purchase price is
attributable to the fair value of the acquired intangible assets for the branded products. Corresponding
adjustments in deferred taxes are to be expected.

As no reliable market values could be determined due to the very short period of time between the
completion of the acquisition at the end of December 2019 and the balance sheet date, the entire
difference between the purchase price and the equity acquired was recognized as goodwill in the amount of
A31.2 million, which was calculated as follows

E million

Purchase price for 100% of the shares of the company approximately . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49.4
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approximately . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.2

In this regard, goodwill resulted for the most part from an expansion of the presence and the sales
activities in the branded products segment in Ukraine.

The preliminary figures for the acquired assets and liabilities correspond to the carrying amounts of the
company. The gross value of the trade accounts receivable was A5.5 million, which were deemed fully
recoverable. Trade accounts receivable were recorded at their fair value in the amount of A5.4 million.

Sales of the Biopharma Group amounted to about A25 million in the reporting year. Earnings after taxes of
this business combination amounted to approx. A5 million in financial year 2019.

In financial year 2020, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for
which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in greater detail below.

**Achievement of control over the Czech Walmark Group**

As of March 4, 2020, STADA achieved control over the Walmark Group, a leading manufacturer of
consumer health products in Eastern Europe. The company sells prescription pharmaceuticals and
consumer health products. The Walmark Group will be included as a subsidiary in the Consolidated
Financial Statements from March 1, 2020.

The purchase price for the acquisition in the amount of A140.2 million was paid entirely in cash and is
composed of the following components: On the one hand, a payment of A89.7 million was made to the
seller as the base purchase price. A further payment made to the seller amounted to A8.3 million and was
used to repay the shareholder loan existing at the time of purchase. In addition, A42.2 million was
transferred to the Walmark group for repayment of the bank loan existing at the time of purchase.

Due to the short period of time between obtaining control and preparing the financial statements, the
preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of A 98.5 million from this business combination,
which was calculated as follows:

E million

Purchase price for 100% of the shares of the company approximately . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 140.2
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approximately . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41.7

In this regard, goodwill resulted primarily from the strengthening of the global branded products portfolio
and from an expansion of the presence in Eastern Europe—particularly in the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.

The preliminary figures for the acquired assets and liabilities correspond to the carrying amounts of the
company.

The gross value of the trade accounts receivable was A12.7 million, which was deemed fully recoverable.
Trade accounts receivable were recorded at their fair value in the amount of A12.7 million.

Sales of the Walmark Group amounted to about A44 million in the reporting year. Earnings after taxes of
this business combination amounted to approx. A�8 million in financial year 2019.

**Acquisition of pharmaceutical products of the Takeda Group as well as associated processes**

STADA acquired pharmaceutical products and associated processes from the Takeda Group as of March 3,
2020. The products will be included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from March 1, 2020. The
purchase price for the acquisition in the amount of A550.0 million was paid entirely in cash.

Due to the short period of time between obtaining control and preparing the financial statements, the
preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of A550.0 million from this business
combination.

In this regard, goodwill resulted primarily from the strengthening of the global branded products portfolio
and from an expansion of the presence in Eastern Europe—particularly in Russia.

Sales of the Takeda portfolio amounted to approximately A186 million in the financial year 2018. No
information is available on the earnings after taxes.

**9. Accounting policies**

Nidda’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these
are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and which are described in more detail below insofar as they are significant for the
Consolidated Financial Statements or for which option rights are exercised.

**Sales are recognized when the control over delimitable goods passes to the customer, meaning that the**
customer is able to determine the use of the delimitable goods and, essentially, derive benefit from them.
As a requirement for this, there must be an agreement with enforceable rights and obligations and, inter
alia, a consideration must be highly likely. The creditworthiness of the customer must be considered in this
instance. The amount of sales is based on the transaction price to which Nidda is expected to be entitled.
Variable considerations that are only considered if it is highly likely that this will not lead to a significant
reversal of sales should there no longer be any uncertainty regarding the variable consideration, have an

F-19

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

influence on the expected transaction price. The amount of the variable consideration is therefore
determined using the expected value method.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated
amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated
expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health
insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective contract in
force.

All license agreements of Nidda are either bound to the realized sales of the licensee or further activities
are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. The realization
of sales is thus distributed over the periods of the contractual term.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses
related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods
(e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead costs (e.g. scheduled depreciation of production
equipment and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value adjustments of excess or obsolete
inventories.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process is to obtain national or multinational regulatory drug
approval. Downstream from the development process is an evaluation process at the end of which a
decision on the actual execution of a development is made. Within the development process itself,
development costs relative to approvals for new drugs result in capitalization as intangible assets if all the
following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to
become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use
(i.e. usually to market it oneself) or sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

Development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense are immediately recognized in the periods in
which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
marketed.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. The STADA
Group is managed as a cash-generating unit in the Nidda Group. For this reason, the impairment test of
goodwill is carried out at this level.

Nidda plans to carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews
also take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying
amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in
use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three

F-20

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order to
determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions,
investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made
individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on
internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications
that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses
are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an
impairment loss cease to exist, corre sponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized
cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of
these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. At Nidda, this affects the capitalized umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco, and the
capitalized umbrella brand Vannier. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with
indefinite useful lives at the level of the individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the
level of the individual companies that generate sales under the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible
assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests.
Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing
an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized
development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of
individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs.
Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally
20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied due to a lack of relevance. To the
extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are reversed if the reasons
for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original historical
costs.

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, Nidda assesses whether
indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for the two areas Generics and Branded
Products with specific parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under ‘‘Other
expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units are defined at the level of individual assets within the areas of Branded Products and
Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods),**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at
the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of sales are determined based on
weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and
overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on
production facilities. Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the
period in which they occur. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be divided into the following categories in accordance with IFRS 9: Measurement at**
amortised cost (‘‘AC’’), financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘‘FVPL’’) and financial assets at
fair value through other comprehensive income (‘‘FVOCI’’). Financial assets are accounted for and
measured in accordance with IFRS 9. This involves classifying a financial asset on the basis of its
contractual cash flow characteristics and business model. Under IFRS 9, a financial asset is carried at cost
if the underlying business model is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (business
model condition). In addition, the cash flow condition must be satisfied. This is the case when the
contractual features of the financial asset at specified times only provide for interest and principal
payments on the outstanding principal amount.

Receivables eligible for factoring are included in trade accounts receivable. Based on the present business
model, they are measured at fair value recorded directly in equity. Changes in the fair value of these
receivables are therefore recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets measured at
fair value recorded directly in equity are generally subject to the same impairment model as financial assets
measured at amortized cost.

In accordance with IFRS 9, expected losses are accounted for on the basis of the expected credit loss
model. The simplified approach is applied for trade accounts receivable. The general approach is generally
applied to other financial assets.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the
expected default risk, the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by debtor are determined.
To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of
receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to
be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces
the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values. These financial liabilities
are reported in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item.

Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging
instruments are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the fair value change of
the hedged underlying transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in
addition to the fair value change in the derivative, the opposing fair value change in the underlying
transaction is recognized in profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the hedged risk.

No use is made of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to
be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

**Leases in which the Group is the lessee are recognized as rights of use within non-current assets and as**
corresponding lease liabilities within other financial assets. Excepted from this are short-term leases with a
maximum term of twelve months as well as leases for low-value assets with a value of below A5,000. Here,
Nidda applies the option to recognize such leases as expenses at the time of the lease payment. Upon
initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the outstanding lease payments,
discounted at the interest rate underlying the lease. If the interest rate underlying the lease cannot be
determined, a marginal debt rate is used. Nidda also makes use of the lease provision not to separate
non-lease components from lease components and recognizes corresponding leases as a single agreement.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated
Financial Statements is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, Nidda
makes estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other
factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and
assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual
circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting
issues concerned are detailed below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

Nidda carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain
assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Assets’’ to the carrying amounts of the respective cash-generating units and an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Costs’’ are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on the basis of individual
appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific
estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The budget
values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal
developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined in the
context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of
impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an
impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

Nidda makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

Nidda operates in various countries and must pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order
to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well
as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and
their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the
final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on actual and
deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in the respective
period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the Nidda Group is being allotted to a comprehensive
tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of
these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement
procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. If it is
probable that amounts recognized in the tax returns cannot be realized, tax liabilities are recognized which
are measured at the most probable amount or the expected value.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the
biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific
mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The
discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed
interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds,
the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. Provisions are created if there is a present external obligation and a
probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on estimates of the prospects of success of these methods. The
determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due
to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

Sales are generated exclusively in the STADA (sub)Group and are based primarily on the supply of
products and, to a lesser extent, from license revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please
refer to the details included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2019, achieved sales were A2,608.6 million (previous year: A2,330.8 million).

The increase in sales in financial year 2019 was based for the most part on good sales development in the
German, Italian, Spanish, British and French market. Development in the Russian market had an opposing
effect. Exchange rate effects and portfolio changes as an adjustment to the previous year’s figure had a
total influence of A79.9 million on sales in the reporting year.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in k E** **2019** **2018**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 966,949 993,033

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A301.3 million (previous year: A289.2 million)
mainly included amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a necessary condition
for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with
reversals. Reversals amounted to A11.9 million (previous year: A9.4 million) in financial year 2019.

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and the sales force, selling expenses also comprise costs for
advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics
that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts
in kind—if possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not included. The resulting
expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing costs of A265.3 million (previous year: A239.0 million) corresponded to a
share of 46% in selling expenses (previous year: 44%). In addition, selling expenses included depreciation
in the amount of A17.0 million (previous year: A7.4 million).

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2019, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A15.8 million
(previous year: A6.1 million).

Overall, general and administrative expenses increased in the reporting year by A17.6 million. This increase
resulted, among other things, from expenses for various transformation projects.

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details
included in Accounting Policies.

**Notes (Continued)**

**15. Research and development expenses (Continued)**

Research and development expenses included depreciation in the amount of A4.4 million (previous year:
A2.4 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A20.4 million were capitalized in
financial year 2019 (previous year: A20.4 million).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

**in k E** **2019** **2018**

Income from the reversal of impairments on receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10,237 10,636

In the financial year, impairments on receivables in the amount of A10.2 million were reversed (previous
year: A10.6 million).

The remaining other income includes, for the most part, compensation claims and other income not
directly associated with functional costs, which comprises many insignificant individual items in the Group
companies. In the previous year, this included income from the capital consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG and was considered a special item.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

**in k E** **2019** **2018**

Expenses from valuation allowances on accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,469 15,523

Other expenses include impairment losses of A101.8 million (previous year: A85.6 million) that only
concern impairment losses on current assets excluding goodwill in the reporting year. These impairment
losses mainly relate to intangible assets. The impairment losses relate to various pharmaceutical approvals
and trademarks, the scheduled amortization of which is reported within cost of sales. The impairments are
primarily attributable to two approvals in the Branded Products segment (A31.2 million and A24.8 million)
due to negative future business prospects as well as a project under development in the Generics segment
(A17.0 million) due to the discontinuation of development activities. In the previous year, there was a
significant impairment of two approvals for branded products (A49.3 million and A11.6 million) due to
negative future business prospects.

In other expenses, in the reporting year expenses from impairments on receivables in the amount of
A1.5 million (previous year: A15.5 million) were recognized. In the previous year, these expenses mainly
related to impairments due to payment defaults of the customers in Russia.

In addition, other expenses in the reporting year also included net currency translation expenses in the
amount of A24.9 million (previous year: net currency exchange income A1.1 million) which are made up of
currency translation income of A28.4 million (previous year: A48.9 million) and currency exchange expenses
of A53.3 million (previous year: A47.8 million).

**17. Other expenses (Continued)**

Losses from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A1.7 million (previous year: A2.1 million).

Additionally, the item ‘‘remaining other expenses’’ included personnel expenses in the amount of
A26.2 million (previous year: A3.9 million), which in the reporting year resulted primarily from severance
payments for a BPO restructuring program and expenses resulting from changes in management (previous
year: severance payments for former members of the Executive Board and expenses resulting from changes
in management). The regular personnel expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective specialist
departments. Primarily, the severance payments affected employees whose regular personnel costs were
recorded under administrative costs.

**18. Financial result**

The result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2019 was related to the companies Pharm
Ortho Pedic SAS, AELIA SAS as well as Dialogfarma LLC which are accounted for using the equity
method. BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG was consolidated in the previous year as an associate until
September 30, 2018, following a successful increase in shareholdings, it has been consolidated as a
subsidiary since September 30, 2018.

**Investment income primarily relates to profit distributions from companies not included in the Consolidated**
Financial Statements.

**Financial income and financial expenses are composed of the interest result and other financial income and**
other financial expenses.

The interest result developed as follows:

- financial liabilities measured at amortized costs (AC) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �249,753 �305,255

As in the previous year, interest income in financial year 2019 includes the compounding effect for the
contractually agreed selling price as of December 31, 2019 for the shares held in Stellapharm J.V. (formerly
STADA Vietnam J.V.).

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2019 included a net interest expense from other
non-current provisions, which comprises interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from
pension obligations and other non-current provisions, in the amount of A0.8 million (previous year:
A0.8 million).

Also included in the interest result are interest expenses in connection with leases in accordance with
IFRS 16 in the amount of A3.3 million.

In financial year 2019, the Group refinanced itself at interest rates of between 1.01% p.a. and 69.15% p.a.
(previous year: between 0.95% p.a. and 7.25% p.a.) whereby the high interest rate is attributable to the
taking of loans in Argentina, the carrying amount of which is, overall, not material for the Group. As of the
balance sheet date December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate for non-current financial
liabilities was approximately 3.90% p.a. (previous year: approximately 4.31% p.a.). As of the balance sheet
date December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate for current financial liabilities was
approximately 8.00% p.a. (December 31, 2018: approximately 1.97% p.a.). The weighted average interest
rate for all of the Group’s financial liabilities was approximately 3.94% p.a. (2018: 4.11% p.a.).

**18. Financial result (Continued)**

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A3.7 million (previous year:
A2.6 million) in financial year 2019. A capitalization rate of 3.0% (previous year: 2.5%) for intangible assets
was taken as a basis.

Other financial income and other financial expenses consist of the following:

The result from the measurement of financial instruments is attributable to the measurement of interest
rate swaps. The measurement of interest rate hedge transactions thereby depends on the development of
the money market interest rate.

**19. Income taxes**

The item income taxes includes taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as
well as deferred tax liabilities. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to the sales,
administration or research and development functions are included in other expenses.

Actual income taxes recognized in the income statement can be divided according to timing as follows:

**In k E** **2019** **2018**

No deferred tax liabilities were formed for temporary differences from undistributed earnings from
subsidiaries in the amount of A15.7 million (previous year: A22.4 million), because these profits will be
reinvested for an indefinite period.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement
was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes. The

The nominal income tax rate for the 2019 financial year for Nidda German Topco GmbH in Germany was
28.32% (previous year: 28.32%), whereby this includes corporate income tax at a rate of 15.0% and the
solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on corporate income tax as well as trade tax on income at an assessment rate
of 357% (previous year: 357%).

The tax effects from loss carryforwards/interest carryforwards and prior-year taxes mainly resulted from
unrecognized deferred tax assets on tax losses and interest carried forward due to non-deductible interest
expenses (so-called interest barrier rule) in Germany as well as the adjustment of tax liabilities for previous
years.

The tax effects from non-deductible expenses mainly result from (partial) additions for generally
deductible financing expenses. The other tax effects resulted mainly from effects of the STADA
(sub)Group.

Deferred tax liabilities reported resulted mainly from deferred taxes in the context of business
combinations under IFRS 3. The reduction in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets compared with
the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization of intangible assets with purchase price
allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as from impairments on such assets. In total,
deferred tax liabilities decreased to A923.2 million as of December 31, 2019 (previous year: A971.5 million).
This development was mainly attributable to the previously described reduction in temporary differences
from intangible assets and lower taxable differences from liabilities. The decrease in loss carryforwards
resulted in particular from the use of tax-loss carryforwards.

Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under
‘‘Deferred taxes from loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards
capitalized as of the balance sheet date December 31, 2019 amounted to A57.9 million in financial year
2019 (previous year: A72.7 million).

The average number of employees in the reporting year increased by 4% to 10,631 (previous year: 10,247),
primarily due to the expansion of the selling and marketing activities in Spain and Italy as well as the
increase in the number of production employees in Serbia and Vietnam. As of the balance sheet date, the
Group’s number of employees increased in 2019 by 7% to 11,121 (previous year: 10,416). This increase was
mainly based on the previously mentioned development in the number of sales and production employees
as well as on the initial consolidation of the Biopharma units as of December 31, 2019 with about 300
employees.

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their
functional relevance, in financial year 2019 were A421.2 million (previous year: A357.4 million).

Additions from business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 which relate to the fair values calculated
within the scope of the purchase price calculation resulted from the acquisition of the Biopharma Group in
the reporting year.

In the Group, the umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco and Laboratorio Vannier are
included as recognized trademarks as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, as it is intended to
make continuing use of them.

As of December 31, 2019, the STADA umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A51.6 million (previous
year: A51.6 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2019, a royalty rate of 1.5%
and, as in the previous year, a discount rate of 7.4% (previous year: 7.5%) were used. There was no
impairment need in the reporting year.

**23. Intangible assets (Continued)**

As of December 31, 2019, the Hemofarm umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A39.7 million (previous
year: A39.5 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2019, a royalty rate of 2% and,
as in the previous year a discount rate of 12.9% (previous year: 13.7%) were used. There was no necessity
for impairment for the reporting year. The change compared to the previous year figure of A0.2 million is
attributable to different exchange rates.

As of December 31, 2019, the Pymepharco umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A9.2 million (previous
year: A8.8 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2019, a royalty rate of 2% and,
as in the previous year, a discount rate of 13.7% (previous year: 14.3%) were used. There was no necessity
for impairment for the reporting year. The change is a result of different exchange rates.

The umbrella brand Laboratorio Vannier remained completely written off and has a carrying amount of
A0.0 million (previous year: A0.0 million).

The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of A14.3 million (previous year: A15.2 million) as of
December 31, 2019, will be amortized as scheduled over its useful life. This was countered by an increase in
the carrying amount in the current financial year as a result of the exchange rate development of the
Russian ruble.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2019 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A3.7 million (previous year: A2.6 million). In financial year
2019, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
3.0% (previous year: 2.5%).

Development costs of A25.0 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A23.7 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocatable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life (generally 20 years). Development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are
recognized immediately as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. In financial year 2019, these
development costs amounted to of A72.8 million (previous year: A72.3 million).

Scheduled amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as
trademarks and is recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year,
this related to an amount of A278.9 million (previous year: A267.7 million).

In financial year 2019, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A101.2 million (previous year: A85.6 million). These impairments resulted primarily from the year-end
impairment tests. No valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation
(see Note 5.).

test is carried out at this level. The increase in goodwill in 2019 relates to the acquisition of the Biopharma
Group.

As part of the regular impairment test for capitalized goodwill as of December 31, 2019, the expected cash
outflow was determined based on the discounted cash flow procedure using the following defined
parameters:

Growth in the 2019 update phase in % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.2%

In the previous year, the parameters that were applied were as follows:

Growth in the 2018 update phase in % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine value in use of the cash-generating units, applying
an individual interest rate for the cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Such
a detailed planning period reflects the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the
period after this three-year detailed plan ning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of
50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year, for the period after the
three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected
long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for determining values in use is based on
certain assumptions that are based on past experience, complemented by internal developments, and
verified based on external market data and analyses. Key assumptions include the development of future
selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market
shares, foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. Significant changes to the aforementioned assumptions
would influence the determination of the values in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates
used are determined based on external factors derived from the market and are adjusted for the risks
predominant in the cash-generating units in question.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the cash-generating units with a
1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a
decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no necessity for an
impairment to any cash-generating unit.

For the regular impairment test in the previous year, there was a headroom in the low triple-digit million
range. Changes to the valuation parameters for the impairment test can influence the value in use of the
cash-generating unit. A sensitivity analysis was therefore conducted for the cash-generating unit by using a
1.0 percentage point increase of the discount rate, a 0.5 percentage point reduction of the growth rate, and
a 10.0 percentage point reduction of the EBIT. Based on these assumptions, there was a need for
impairment in the amount of:

**WACC** **Growth rates** **EBIT**
**Sensitivity analysis—impact on the need for impairment** **+1.0 percentage** �0.5 percentage �10.0 percentage
**in E million E** **points** **points** **points**

The following development in the respective valuation parameter would mean that the value in use of the
cash-generating unit would be equal to its carrying amount:

consolidation.

With the initial application of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, rights of use are presented separately within
property, plant and equipment. These rights of use relate for the most part to leases of buildings and
vehicles. The average lease term for buildings is five years, while vehicles are generally leased over a period
of three years.

In the previous year, property, plant and equipment included assets from finance leases, primarily relating
to cars and trucks, in the amount of A5.3 million, which, in accordance with IAS 17, were recognized at the

Financial assets are the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated investments. There is
currently no intention to sell these financial assets.

The change in fair value (FVOCI) results from the exercising of the option in accordance with IFRS 9 to
recognize changes in the fair value of equity instruments in other comprehensive income. In the reporting
year, this related to the investment in XBrane Biopharma AB.

The decline in investments measured at equity in financial year 2019 resulted primarily from the
reclassification of the shares held by STADA in Stellapharm J.V. (formerly STADA Vietnam J.V.) to
non-current assets held for sale (IFRS 5).

Interest rate effects exclusively related to Stellapharm J.V. as the equity carrying amount of the company
Stellapharm J.V. corresponds to the contractually agreed selling price for the shares held by STADA for
the sale as of December 31, 2019, taking into account a corresponding discounting effect.

Dividend distributions essentially included the dividends paid by Stellapharm J.V. for financial year 2019
and 2018, which represent partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth
quarter of 2017 to sell the shares in this company held by STADA.

As of December 31, 2019, as in the previous year, there were no trade accounts receivable due after one
year.

Collateral exists for a portion of trade accounts receivable whose value was not impaired in the form of
bank or corporate guarantees as well as pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit
insurance for certain markets and customers. These are taken into account in the calculation of the default
risk.

The regulations on the classification of financial assets lead to changes in the measurement and disclosure
of factoring-capable receivables on the basis of the present business model. These financial assets, which
continue to be included in trade accounts receivable, are no longer measured at amortized cost within the
scope of IFRS 9 but at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these
receivables are recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. In this context, financial assets
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are generally subject to the same impairment
model as financial assets measured at amortized cost.

For trade accounts receivable, an expected default on receivables is calculated over their terms on the basis
of a portfolio-specific default rate. The default rate indicates the probability that a debtor will default
within a period of one year. The default rates consider the industry risks and the economic environment of
the respective country. Each cluster is allocated to a different bandwidth of expected default rates.

**28. Return Assets**

As of December 31, 2019, return assets due after one year amounted to A0.7 million (previous year:
A0.6 million). The return assets relate to expected returns in connection with agreements with customers
for which reutilization is expected.

**29. Other financial assets**

Other financial assets are composed as follows:

transactions of German Group companies in the amount of A4.4 million (previous year: A4.6 million) and
A1.3 million from Group companies in the United Kingdom were presented in other financial assets.

The derivative financial assets include the positive market values of currency forwards.

As of December 31, 2019, other financial assets included impairments in the amount of A9.5 million

Other assets comprise many insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

As of December 31, 2019, other financial assets included impairments in the amount of A6.5 million
(previous year: A6.5 million).

**31. Inventories**

Inventories can be subdivided as follows:

In financial year 2019, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of
inventories in the amount of A40.9 million (previous year: A35.7 million), which were already deducted
from the amounts shown above through profit and loss. The write-ups in this regard amounted to
A11.9 million (previous year: A9.4 million).

**32. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subject to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the respective
national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash equivalents
amounted to A5.0 million (previous year: A2.2 million) exclusively related to cash in China.

The development of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 at A207.4 million (previous year:
A360.7 million) resulted from the effects described as part of the explanations of the consolidated cash flow
statement. Further details on the development of cash and cash equivalents can be found in the
consolidated cash flow statement.

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities**

As of December 31, 2019, in the STADA Group, an asset held for sale in the amount of A3.1 million was
presented in a separate line item in the balance sheet. This includes as a significant item an intangible asset
of A3.1 million that belongs to the Branded Products segment.

In the first quarter of 2019, the shares in Stellapharm J.V. (formerly STADA Vietnam J.V.) valued at equity
were reclassified as non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale. Due to the declaration of sale
signed in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the shares in Stellapharm held by STADA, this company has no
longer been consolidated as a subsidiary in the meaning of IFRS 10 since December 2017, but rather as a
unit to be accounted for at equity in accordance with IAS 28. As the sale of the shares in Stellapharm was

**Notes (Continued)**

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities (Continued)**

completed in December 2019, there were no longer any non-current assets and disposal groups held for
sale as of December 31, 2019.

In the third quarter 2019, the selling process for the disposal of a British subsidiary was launched. As of
September 30, 2019, a sale within 12 months was considered highly probable and the assets and associated
liabilities were classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. After obtaining and evaluating offers
from prospective buyers, the decision was made not to pursue the sale process any further at that time.
Consequently, no IFRS 5 disclosure was made as of December 31, 2019. This reclassification led to a
catch-up of A6.0 million in scheduled depreciation and amortization that had not been reported under
IFRS 5.

In the previous year, assets held for sale in the amount of A0.1 million were presented as a separate line
item in the balance sheet.

**34. Equity**

Group equity amounted to A723.9 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: A�369.8 million).
This corresponds to an equity ratio of 9.6% (previous year: �5.4%).

**34.1. Share capital and capital reserve**

Share capital amounted to A25,000 as of December 31, 2019 (previous year: A25,000) and was fully paid-up.

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and exclusively include the capital reserve of Nidda German Topco GmbH.

In financial year 2019, there was a voluntary contribution to the capital reserve of Nidda German
Topco GmbH, consisting of the contribution and assignment of the claim to repayment of the loan amount
with the shareholder Nidda Midco S.`a r.l., Luxembourg, in the amount of A1,066.8 million and the
assignment of the associated claim to interest payment in the amount of A51.1 million. As a result, the
capital reserve increased by a total of A1,117.9 million.

The decrease by A517.4 million of the capital reserve in financial year 2018 is related to the initial
recognition of a financial liability in the amount of A1,586.5 million due to the conclusion of the DPLTA
between Nidda Healthcare GmbH and STADA Arzneimittel AG.

**34.2. Retained earnings including net result**

Retained earnings including net result comprise the net result for financial year 2019 as well as income
generated in earlier periods, insofar as there were not distributed, including amounts transferred to
retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized
through other comprehensive income are reported under this item, taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019, the net expense in the
amount of A4.9 million—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling interests—resulted from
the remeasurement (previous year: income in the amount of A0.9 million) after deferred taxes. In addition,
this position also includes currency translation differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized
in equity from performance-oriented pension plans as well as the deferred taxes they incur which, in
financial year 2019, amounted to expenses recognized in equity of A0.1 million (previous year:
A0.03 million).

**34.3. Other reserves**

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are reported in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve.

Due to the application of the new standard IFRS 9, other reserves additionally include the reserve FVOCI.
Under this item, fair value changes of the fair value receivables recognized through other comprehensive

**34. Equity (Continued)**

income as well as equity instruments accounted for at fair value are accounted for without impact on profit
or loss.

The increase in other reserves in the reporting year resulted in particular from the appreciation of the
Russian ruble and the British pound since December 31, 2018, which led to income from foreign currency
translation of the companies reporting in this currency.

**34.4. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares relating to non-controlling interests as of December 31, 2019 related to the minority interests of
other shareholders in the subsidiaries BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm Banja Luka,
Hemomont, NorBiTec GmbH, Pymepharco and STADA Pharmaceuticals (Beijing).

**35. Other non-current provisions**

Other non-current provisions made as of the balance sheet date in Germany and outside Germany include
pension provisions and other non-current provisions in the form of anniversary provisions and provisions
for working time accounts and early retirement as follows:

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among other things, insurances, government bonds and securities funds.

In financial year 2019, the plan assets at the subsidiaries did not exceed their pension obligations, with the
result that for the current financial year, there was no excess under other assets as assets from overfunded
pension plans (previous year: A0.03 million).

Plan assets were divided according to investment type as follows:

The past service cost in the reporting year amounts to a gain of A1.2 million and is largely attributable to
the introduction of new plans in Russia (indemnities) as an expense as well as income from the elimination
of pension plans funded by reserves in the Netherlands which, in the future, will be funded solely through

The amount of the income from plan assets for German Group companies is largely determined by raising
the value of the plan assets of a commitment to the value of the gross obligation on the basis of the
reinsurance available for this purpose. This decreased as a result of the significantly lower discount rate in
the financial year 2019 and thus had an increasing effect on income. The reduction in the income from
plan assets abroad is mainly due to a positive performance of plan assets in the United Kingdom and
Ireland as well as an increase in the income from plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the
amount of plan assets is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation and is therefore crucially
dependent on the development of the discount rate. In financial year 2019, the actuarial interest rate fell.
This led to an increase in the obligation and the plan assets and thus the income. As a result of the switch
of the pension plan to a solely contribution-funded solution as of the end of this financial year, this effect
occurs for the last time.

The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and
pension costs:

**Parameters for pension obligations for German Group companies (weighted)** **Dec. 31, 2019** **Dec. 31, 2018**

The increase in the pension trend is primarily attributable to the fact that the pension plan in the
Netherlands is no longer included in the calculation of the average—a pension trend of 0% applies for this
plan.

A sensitivity analysis was carried out in which only one assumption was changed in each case and all other
assumptions were not changed. In the following, the change in the defined benefit obligation of the
pension obligations (DBO) for German Group companies is presented according to a change in the
discount rate, salary trends and pension trends:

The salary trend is largely insignificant, because all active plan participants are close to reaching the
scheduled retirement age.

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan assets, are expected in the amount of A0.8 million for German Group companies
and A3.6 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the
company. For the Group, pension plans in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the
largest share of total obligations with 80%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these
countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension
plans. Furthermore, regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The
retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired
employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In
the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as
a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In addition, there is a pre-retirement regulation for
selected employees.

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2019, plan assets amounted to A46.7 million and were composed of
three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally.
Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the STADA Arzneimittel AG Executive Board
Hartmut Retzlaff was transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the
necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit
plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing
plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan

amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions
are expected in the future.

In the United Kingdom, employees are provided with defined benefit plans that are concluded for new
hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plans are subject to the United Kingdom Trust Law and the United Kingdom Pension Regulator. The
pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also
responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to
cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate
and participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If
the discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional
contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to
expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

As of December 31, 2019, plan assets amounted to A26.0 million. All assets have quoted market prices on
an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S2
Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table
CMI 2018 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are
no longer relevant for the pension plan.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension
law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. The Group’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the
pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality
and fluctuation.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan as of the end of the financial year 2019 was switched to a
contribution-based solution. All entitlements are fully guaranteed in terms of insurance, so that no
provisions will be formed from 2019.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements
or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution
plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to
A28.6 million in financial year 2019 (previous year: A26.9 million).

rate of 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019 (‘‘second SSN bond’’). In addition, the Company was provided a
further credit facility under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of A260.0 million
(‘‘Facility E’’) among other things to finance the acquisition of Eastern European pharmaceutical company
Walmark which, however, had not been utilized as of the closing date.

On December 20, 2018, STADA announced that it and certain of its significant subsidiaries—in line with
the instruction received from Nidda—had granted certain in rem securities to secure certain capital market
indebtedness and other debt financing which is borrowed and/or guaranteed by Nidda and its affiliates[58].
The provision of these collateral securities meant that the holders of the STADA A300,000,000 1.75%
bonds with maturity in 2022 had the right to redeem the nominal amount and accrued interest under the
STADA bonds. The STADA bond was therefore classified as current as of December 31, 2018. On
January 8, 2019, STADA published the relevant tender offer, whose final expiration date was June 19,
2019[59]. On June 21, 2019, STADA announced that under the tender offer, since its announcement on
January 8, 2019, bonds in a nominal amount of A6,676,000 had been repurchased[60].

**39. Other financial liabilities (Continued)**

Liabilities from leases in accordance with IFRS 16, for cars and trucks, among other things, amounted to
A55.5 million as of December 31, 2019. Considering interest in the amount of A6.8 million, lease
installments payable in subsequent years totaled A62.2 million. The new standard IFRS 16 was applied for
the first time from January 1, 2019 and was modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year
figures was waived. For this reason, the accounting treatment of leases in the previous year followed the
standard IAS 17, which was applicable up to that date.

The leasing liabilities are due as follows:

**Lease installments** **Interest** **Liabilities from leases**
**Dec. 31, 2019** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2019** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2019** **Dec. 31, 2018**

The conversion to IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019 led to an increase in lease liabilities in the amount of
A 59.0 million. The increase in leasing liabilities during the financial year due to newly recognized leases
was offset by current lease payments and fell to A55.5 million as of the balance sheet date December 31,
2019.

In the previous year, the following reconciliation was made for liabilities from financial leasing, the cash
changes of which are included in the cash flow from financing activities:

In addition, negative market values of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss were
reported in liabilities from derivative financial instruments. In financial year 2019, this related to currency
forwards and interest rate swaps. Within the scope of the maturity date analysis, the following contractually
agreed remaining terms result for these derivative financial liabilities:

Remaining financial liabilities include liabilities from discount agreements of German STADA companies
in the amount of A150.9 million (previous year: A128.1 million) and also comprise many immaterial
individual items in the Group companies. Remaining financial liabilities in the amount of A214.0 million

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure,
financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in
foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from
operating activities amounted to A308.6 million in the reporting year (previous year: A231.4 million).

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the proceeds from
disposals. This amounted to A�265.0 million in the reporting year (previous year: A�300.3 million).

In financial year 2019, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets amounted to A161.7 million
(previous year: A280.3 million). Of this amount, A135.1 million (previous year: A255.4 million) was
attributable to payments for significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the
product portfolio which, with A84.2 million, primarily related to the acquisition of a branded products
portfolio in the United Kingdom. Within the scope of business combinations, there were net payments
from the acquisition of the Biopharma Group in the amount of A47.5 million.

Payments received from the disposal of assets amounted to A31.5 million in the reporting year (previous
year: A9.2 million). Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies as well as from the
disposal of non-current assets held for sale related to dividends from Stellapharm J.V. (formerly STADA
Vietnam J.V.), which was previously accounted for using the equity method. They represent partial
payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell the shares in
this company held by STADA as of December 31, 2019 as well as the final purchase price payment.

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement (Continued)**

Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A�196.8 million in financial year 2019 and generally
encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution payments as well as
additions to shareholders’ equity (previous year: A�45.7 million).

This development is primarily attributable to the following effects: In the fourth quarter of 2019, Nidda
Healthcare Holding GmbH issued a bond (‘‘second SSN bond’’) with a carrying amount of A600.7 million
for the financing of the Takeda acqui- sition, the conclusion of which was carried out in the first quarter of
2020. The associated amounts were held in an escrow account as of the balance sheet date, as these funds
are specifically intended for the execution of this transaction. Presen- tation of the retention on this escrow
account is also carried out in cash flow from financing activities. The assumption of financial liabilities
includes an amount of A11.7 million which relates for the most part to transactions in connection with the
issue of the bond which is accrued in other financial liabilities. Furthermore, the scheduled repayment of
promissory note loans of STADA Arzneimittel AG were recorded. In addition, cash flow from financing
activities was influenced by the repayment of financial liabilities from leases which now also include the
leases identified within the scope of the new standard IFRS 16 which was applied for the first time as of
January 1, 2019.

The cash flow from financing activities in the previous year was impacted by the following effects: In the
previous year, in order to finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG publicly tendered as part of the
purchase offer, the Second SUN Bond with a volume of A250.0 million was issued by Nidda
BondCo GmbH on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018. In addition, Nidda Healthcare GmbH
received an additional loan under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of
A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility D’’). Conversely, cash flow from financing activities including
payments of A1,447.0 million were made in 2018 in connection with the delisting tender offer as a change in
minority interests. Furthermore, in the second quarter of 2018, a bond issued by STADA Arzneimittel AG
in the amount of A347.1 million took place and was repayed according to schedule.

Payments for dividend distributions amounted to A17.0 million related entirely to dividends paid to the
non-controlling shareholders within the STADA Group.

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities
amounted to A43.7 million in financial year 2019 (previous year: A�68.9 million).

Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

Free cash flow, adjusted for effects from payments for significant investments and acquisitions and effects
of proceeds from significant disposals is calculated as follows:

**in k E** **2019** **2018**

**44. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations to third parties based on past events but which will not
become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not under Nidda’s
control. As of the balance sheet date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are
therefore not accounted for. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for

F-65

**Notes (Continued)**

**44. Contingent liabilities (Continued)**

which however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the
obligation cannot be adequately estimated.

Contingent liabilities relate, among other things, to patent risks for certain active pharmaceutical
ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. For the calculation of potential obligations
from patent risks, within the scope of the reporting on contingent liabilities, the expiration date of the
underlying patent has been used since the beginning of financial year 2019. Had this calculation logic
already been used as of December 31, 2018, contingent liabilities in the amount of A50.8 million would
have been reported (instead of A31.0 million which was published as of December 31, 2018).

The possible obligations amounted to approx. A58.8 million (previous year: A50.8 million). The increase of
A8.0 million as compared to the previous year is based primarily on possible obligations from legal
disputes.

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under
50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**45. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations, which can be
broken down as follows:

**in k E** **Dec. 31, 2019** **Dec. 31, 2018**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,265 48,743
Other financial obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 99,998 84,408

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **105,263** **133,151**

As a result of the introduction of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, lease liabilities are recognized in the
balance sheet within other financial liabilities, which is why these are not included in other financial
obligations in the reporting year. In the information on future obligations from leases as of December 31,
2019 includes, however, obligations from short-term leases as well as leases for low-value assets that are
not accounted for in other financial liabilities. Obligations from leases in accordance with IAS 17 related in
the previous year to IT equipment and vehicles as well as long-term lease agreements for office buildings.

Total future minimum leasing payments based on leases is comprised as follows after their remaining
terms:

**Obligations leases**
**in k E** **Dec. 31, 2019** **Dec. 31, 2018**

Remaining term up to 1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,505 18,161
Remaining terms over 1 year to 5 years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,336 27,649
Remaining terms over 5 years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 424 2,933

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **5,265** **48,743**

Lease payments in the amount of A11.8 million were recognized as an expense in financial year 2019
(previous year: A34.6 million). This included expenses in the amount of A1.9 million for short-term leases
and A0.6 million for leases for low-value assets.

Other financial obligations include long-term obligations for logistics and accounting services. In addition,
bona fide contingent liabilities in the amount of A33.7 million (previous year: A28.3 million) in Spain,
Belgium and the United Kingdom and further guarantees assumed are included in other financial
liabilities.

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short residual terms, their
carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to their fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of
promissory note loans, bonds, liabilities to banks as well as liabilities to shareholders. The cash flows
calculated by means of the current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the
fair values for liabilities to banks.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables and of financial investments held until maturity with a
remaining term of less than one year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expecta- tions. Trade accounts payable as well as remaining financial
liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair
values.

Financial assets recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) include factorable
receivables. These financial assets, which are still included in trade accounts receivable, are recognized at
fair value through other comprehensive income and are therefore included in the table above. Changes in
the fair value of these receivables—which differs from the measurement at amortized cost to only a minor
extent—are recognized through other comprehensive income in the FVOCI reserve. Newly included in this
category are the shares acquired in the reporting period from the Swedish company XBrane. Because the
company’s shares are traded on the stock exchange, they have been classified in Stage 1.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, the allocation to the respective hierarchy
levels is reviewed according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If a need for
reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period.
In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include, as in the previous
year, positive or negative market values of derivative financial instruments (currency swaps and interest
rate swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards are determined using
financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as
spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous
year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties.

In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/DKK, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD, EUR/AUD and
EUR/GBP) are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from
intercompany loans with companies that keep their accounting in a local currency other than euros. The

changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency
exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value
hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this
hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively
on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.

Due to an individual circumstance, the underlying transactions for currency forwards with a nominal value
of A4.4 million maturing on February 6, 2020 have ceased to exist in the short term. These currency
forwards, which are located in other financial liabilities, all have a negative market value of A0.2 million,
which is recognized under other expenses.

In financial year 2019, as in the previous year, no financial assets and liabilities allocated to hierarchy
level 3 and recognized at fair value existed.

**46.2. Net earnings from financial instruments by valuation category**

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result. Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from interest rate swaps, and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value through profit or
loss, which are reported under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the currency
translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other income or other
expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to the fulfillment of currency swaps.

**Factoring transactions with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks**

There are revolving receivable selling agreements with banks and financial institutes (together ‘‘receivables
buyers’’) with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks for two agreements without a general
purchase limit and for two agreements with a purchase limit of A26.2 million. The agreements have an

unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby Nidda is free to decide if and in what
amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk evaluation with
regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk).
In return for a fixed program fee recognized in expenses at the time of derecognition, both risks are fully
transferred to the buyer of the receivable and for two programs through the payment of monthly discount
fees. The nominal volume of receivables sold but not yet paid under the factoring agreements amounted to
A47.2 million on the reporting date.

**Factoring transactions with distribution of essential opportunities and risks for which control of the asset**
**remains with the Nidda Group**

There are factoring agreements pursuant to which, on a revolving basis, trade accounts receivable up to a
total general purchase limit of A136.8 million are sold to banks and financial institutes. The agreements
have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby the Nidda Group is free to decide if
and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk
evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late
payment risk). The credit risk is partially transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The late payment risk
continues to be borne in its entirety. The maximum credit risk to be borne, translated into euro, amounted
to A�1.8 million as of the reporting date. The other credit-risk related defaults are assumed by the buyer.
The late payment risk continues to be borne in its entirety by the Group. The maximum risk of loss for the
Group resulting from the credit risk and the late payment risk from the receivables sold as of the reporting
date, translated into euro, amounted to A1.9 million. The nominal volume of receivables sold but not yet
paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to A61.6 million on the reporting
date. The ongoing commitment of the Group as of December 31, 2019, translated into euro, amounted to
A1.9 million and the carrying amount of the associated liability, translated into euro, amounted to
A1.9 million.

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments**

**47.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Management in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all transactions
above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Management must first be approved by the
Management. Management is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount of current risks.

**47.2. Currency risks**

The balance sheet and Group currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, the Group is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

However, the Group is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency risks
through, alongside natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge
currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, use
was made of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures
contracts are adjusted to the term of the underlying transactions. The remaining term of the contracts is
currently up to one year.

In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations
lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the
conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency
than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally
negative and depreciation is generally positive.

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments (Continued)**

Determined quantitative disclosures were made on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In the case of hedging transactions, they are compared with the
balances of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material
outstanding foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the
foreign currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison with the
respective functional currency are as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2019**

In this regard, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items British pounds and Russian rubles relate to a balance from foreign
currency holdings from German and international Group companies in British pounds and Russian rubles
and outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro. The reported outstanding foreign currency positions in
US dollars relate exclusively to foreign currency holdings in US dollars at German and international
Group companies. In addition, there are currency forwards (EUR/USD) for the acquisition of the Takeda
portfolio, the underlying transaction of which is not yet presented in the balance sheet. The risk in
connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective, results
from the functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall, based on
outstanding foreign currency items as of the reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the
respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would have
led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A32.7 million (previous year: A25.9 million) or
in the amount of earnings of A10.2 million (previous year: A25.9 million).

**47.3. Interest rate risks**

Interest risks from the investment of financial assets as well as financial debts, stand primarily in Euro.

F-72

**Notes (Continued)**

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments (Continued)**

In 2019, an average of 52% (previous year: 47%) of financial liabilities denominated in euro had fixed
interest rates. Currently there are no cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps.

Existing interest rate risks are calculated using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors—if relevant—are generally included in the calculation:

- Changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are
not hedged against interest rate risks, and

- Changes in the market interest rate of interest derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

The interest-rate risk is of secondary importance.

**47.4. Default risks**

The Group is exposed to a default risk in its operating business if contracting parties fail to meet their
obligations. Alongside the implementation of appropriate credit management processes, such transactions
are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing to avoid default risks in
financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. Business relations are sought only
with partners of impeccable financial standing. In addition, the Group partly uses suitable measures such
as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard itself against default risk. Past due
receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored and potential default risks are anticipated
through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that in a difficult economic
and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments to Group
companies or business partners of the Group and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default
risks arise.

The maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized.
In addition, the Group granted guarantees that amounted to a total nominal volume of A34.4 million as of
the reporting date (previous year: A29.0 million). Various forms of collateral for credit securities are held,
such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of receivables and pledged inventories.
Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets and customers.

**47.5. Liquidity risks**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of
liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of the Group at all times by maintaining
a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves. Financing is obtained through short-term and long-term
borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, the Group also has solid
operating cash flow.

**47.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

Currency risks are countered with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively used to hedge
interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities and financial transactions. Derivative
financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/DKK, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD, EUR/AUD and
EUR/GBP) are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from
intercompany loans with companies that keep their accounting in a local currency other than euros. The
changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency
exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value
hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this
hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively
on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.
In the reporting period, new fair value hedges with a nominal volume totaling A284.7 million were
designated for reduction of the fair value risk. As of December 31, 2019, currency derivatives with a net
fair value of k A�240 (December 31, 2018: k A1,770) were designated as hedging instruments within the
scope of fair value hedges. Gains recognized in currency translation result in financial year 2019 of k A9,237
resulted from the carrying amount adjustment of the hedged item (previous year: losses of k A4,088), from
changes in fair values of the spot component of hedging transactions, losses of k A9,237 (previous year:
gains of k A4,088) were recognized in the currency translation result.

**47.7. Disclosures on capital management**

The objectives of the capital management are the safeguarding of business operations, the creation of a
solid equity base for financing profitable growth as well as dividend payments and the capital service.
Capital management consistently aims for the Group companies to have an equity basis that corresponds
to the local requirements. When implementing and checking the Group’s capital and liquidity, legal
requirements are taken into account.

Net debt, which results from current and non-current financial liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents is
an important key figure for capital management. Net debt was as follows:

**48. Related party transactions (Continued)**

**Share-based remuneration in the form of a share purchase plan**

The main shareholders of Nidda German Topco GmbH’s most senior parent company, Nidda Topco
S.`a r.l., Luxembourg, have offered a share purchase plan to selected managers of the Group, including all
members of STADA’s Executive Board and some members of its Supervisory Board (managers in key
positions). Pursuant to the conditions of the offer, the managers in question are authorized to acquire a
stake in a German limited partnership (GmbH & Co KG). The limited partnership stake in the partnership
amounts to A7.3 million and is held by managers in key positions (24%), other man- agers (48%) and the
main shareholders of Nidda Topco S.`a r.l., Luxembourg as well as third parties (28%). Accordingly, the
partnership holds 8.0% of ordinary shares issues of Nidda Topco S.`a r.l., Luxembourg.

The purchase price of the limited partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG is determined on each
acquisition date on the basis of the fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.`a r.l., Luxembourg,
and the additional special features of the program. The fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco
S.`a r.l., Luxembourg, is determined on the basis of the discounted cash flow valuation taking into account
the expected cash flow from the investment in STADA as well as for the financing instruments issued by
the Nidda Group companies. The purchase price calculation is considered to be the fair value of the
limited partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG, but not as the granting of additional remuneration for
the management. In the event of continued employment by the company, the management will participate
in the change in the fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.`a r.l., Luxembourg, through this
investment by ultimately selling the shares together with the other shareholders of Nidda Topco S.`a r.l.,
Luxembourg.

Neither Nidda Topco S.`a r.l., Luxembourg, nor Nidda German Topco GmbH or any other Group company
is obligated to pay any amount to the management under this program. In accordance with IFRS 2, the
program is treated as a share- based remuneration plan that does not grant any or no significant additional
remuneration to managers.

**48.2. Transactions with related companies**

Bain Capital Investors, LLC, Wilmington, Delaware, USA, and Cinven (Luxco 1) S.A., Luxembourg,
exercise direct joint control over the indirect subsidiary Nidda Topco S.`a r.l., which in turn holds
controlling interest in Nidda German Topco GmbH via its subsidiary Nidda Midco S.`a r.l. The direct
subsidiary of Cinven (Luxco 1) S.A., Cinven Capital Management (VI) General Partner Limited, St. Peter
Port, Guernsey, is the fund manager for certain entities of the Sixth Cinven Fund in the sense of an
investment management company.

**49. Remuneration of the Management in Key Positions**

The core elements of the system applied for members of the Executive Board include non-performance
related annual remuneration that takes the tasks and performance of the member of the Executive Board
into consideration along with a component that depends on the achievement of annual performance goals
(‘‘Short Term Incentive’’, STI). In addition to the annual performance-related remuneration, members of
the Executive Board receive a long-term planned remuneration component (‘‘Long-Term Incentive’’, LTI).
The individual performance-related components are limited to a maximum amount.

The remuneration system for the Supervisory Board includes an annual fixed remuneration as well as a
variable compo- nent, depending on an average performance figure from the last three years. The
Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives triple this amount and his deputy twice the amount. In
addition, Supervisory Board members receive a fixed remuneration for committee activities.

For explanations on share-based remuneration in the form of a stock purchase plan for persons in key
positions, we refer to Note 48.1.

Below, the remuneration of persons in key positions are presented in accordance with IAS 24. Insofar as

**50. Fees for the auditor (Continued)**

The fees for audits relate to payments for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda
German Topco GmbH.

**51. Events after the end of the financial year**

After the closing date, the following events with significant or possibly significant effects on the net assets,
financial position and results of operations occurred:

On February 7, 2020 STADA announced that the company is acquiring the FERN-C portfolio in the
Philippines, a well- established range of vitamin C food supplements. This is an asset acquisition. The
purchase price amounts to A18 million.

On February 24, 2020, STADA announced it had agreed to acquire 15 well-established consumer
healthcare brands from GlaxoSmithKline across more than 40 countries, predominantly in Europe, and
multiple therapeutic areas. Due to the limited amount of time between the transaction and the preparation
of the financial statements, there is not yet a final assessment as to whether the transaction is a business
combination or an asset acquisition. The purchase price is between A311 million and A321 million. To
finance the transaction, among other things, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued a bond with a
nominal volume of A350.0 million and an interest rate of 3.5% p.a. in February 2020.

On March 3, 2020, the acquisition of selected products from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited was
completed (see Note 8. ‘‘Business combinations’’). Due to the limited amount of time between the
transaction and the preparation of the financial statements, there is not yet a final assessment as to
whether the transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition. The purchase price amounts to
approximately USD 610 million.

On March 4, 2020, the acquisition of Walmark, a leading manufacturer of consumer health products in
Eastern Europe, was completed (see Note 8. ‘‘Business combinations’’). This is a business combination.
The purchase price amounts to approx. A140 million.

The following auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Nidda German Topco GmbH as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2019. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, and the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement
of changes in shareholder’s equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2019, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary
of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Nidda
German Topco GmbH for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2019.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
§ [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial
position of the Group as at December 31, 2019, and of its financial performance for the financial year
from January 1 to December 31, 2019, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management
report.

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in
the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**Other Information**

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The other information comprises the annual report—excluding cross-references to external information—
with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report
and our auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

F-80


-----

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibility of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group**
**Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position,
and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such
internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material mis-statement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group

management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements,
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Notes**

**General Information**

**1. Corporate information**

Nidda German Topco GmbH (formerly Blitz 17-89 GmbH) as the parent company of the Nidda Group
(herein-after referred to as ‘‘Nidda Group’’ or ‘‘Group’’), with business address, c/o STADA Arzneimittel
AG, Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is a Germany-based company. The operating activities comprise
the management of its own assets as well as the acquisition, sale, holding and management of investments
in other companies which are active in the healthcare market both in Germany and abroad.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH for financial year 2018 were
approved for publication by the Management Board on March 13, 2019.

**2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements**

The Consolidated Financial Statements prepared for Nidda German Topco GmbH as parent company as
of December 31, 2018, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union
(EU), as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the
German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. Since Nidda German Topco GmbH was entered in the
commercial register on April 18, 2017, the financial year refers to the comparison period from April 18,
2017 to December 31, 2017. The individual financial statements of the companies included in the scope of
consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or non-current distinction.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
notes are shown in euro thousands (A k). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2018, Nidda observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to
pronouncements published by the IASB and adopted by the EU which were first applicable as of
January 1, 2018. The following changes had effects on the presentation of Nidda’s net assets, financial
position and results of operations and cash flow:

In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. The standard replaces IAS 39
and introduces new rules for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments.
Furthermore, IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.

Nidda applied the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018, pursuant to the transitional
regulations of IFRS 9, an adjustment of the previous year’s figures is waived. Accordingly, the cumulative
effect from initial application of IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018 was recognized in equity with no effect on
profit or loss.

IFRS 9 introduces a new model for classifying financial assets. They are classified according to their
contractual cash flow properties and business model within the context of which they are held. Financial
instruments in the category ‘‘measured at amortized cost’’ (AC) are classified into the new category ‘‘fair
value through other comprehensive income’’ (FVOCI) or ‘‘fair value through profit or loss’’ (FVPL) in the
result.

In accordance with IFRS 9, a financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
if the underlying business model consists of holding assets in order to collect contractual cash flow and sell
financial assets (business model condition). In addition, a cash flow condition must be met. This is the case
if the contractual technical characteristics of the financial asset only provide for interest payments and
repayments on the outstanding capital amount at defined points in time.

The new regulations for the classification of financial assets lead to changes for the receivables that can be
factored in terms of their measurement and presentation as a result of this business model. Financial assets
that are still included in trade accounts receivable are now no longer measured at amortized cost but
through other comprehensive income at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these receivables will
therefore in future be recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve.

Financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are therefore
generally subject to the same impairment model as financial assets valued at amortized cost. Equity
instruments and derivatives must generally be measured at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to
IFRS 9.

In accordance with IFRS 9, equity instruments in general and derivatives are always measured at fair value
through profit or loss. For equity instruments, IFRS 9 offers the choice to record changes in fair value
under other comprehensive income. Nidda has not made use of this option to date.

Due to the new regulations on impairment, expected losses will in future be recognized as expenses earlier
in accordance with IFRS 9. While the incurred losses model was essential to create a risk provision
pursuant to IAS 39, this is based on the expected credit losses model pursuant to IFRS 9. In this context,
Nidda applied the simplified approach for trade accounts receivable. The general approach is normally
applied for other financial assets. Impairments increased by A2.7 million as a result of the first-time
application of the impairment regulations pursuant to IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018. Reconciling the risk
provision pursuant to IAS 39 to the expected credit losses (ECL) pursuant to IFRS 9 is shown below:

The changes made in accordance with IFRS 9 resulted in adjustments as of January 1, 2018 to the FVOCI
reserve and to the profit carried forward (not taking into account the amounts for shares relating to

In May 2014, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular
replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.

Nidda applied the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018. In this regard, Nidda made use of
its right to choose the simplified initial application. Accordingly, the contracts that were not fully
completed as of January 1, 2018, are accounted for as if the new standard IFRS 15 was already applied
when these contracts began so that the cumulative effect from the change is recognized directly in equity.
There is no adjustment of the comparable figures from the prior-year period.

An increasing accumulative effect in the amount of A0.3 million was recognized in retained earnings
including net income from the first-time application of IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018. The effect resulted
primarily from the to be accounted contractual assets which in future are to be shown within the scope of
return regulations and the deferred taxes to be established as a result.

Furthermore, down-payments received led to reclassifications from trade accounts payable to contractual
liabilities in the amount of A0.6 million. The new standard on revenue recognition thus had little impact on
sales accounting, as sales are largely realized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of
routine transactions. There are no agreements in the Group which regulate multiple services within one
contract or within several contracts (multi-element arrangements). There were no changes in the
accounting of licensing agreements, which amounted to less than 2% of the total sales revenue in financial
year 2017. All license agreements of STADA are either bound to the achieved sales of the licensee or
further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee.
If this were not the case for such license agreements, the result, due to the new IFRS 15 standard, future
sales would be realized in the amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore
no longer, as they are presently, divided over the term of the license.

The effects on STADA’s consolidated balance sheet as a result of the first-time application of the new
IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards as at January 1, 2018 are shown below:

**The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB:**

In January 2016, the IASB published the new IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ standard, which determines the
recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (financial liabilities) associated with leases in the
balance sheet for lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating
leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier
application is permitted. Nidda will apply the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and
thereby likely modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures will be waived. In this
context, the rights of use will likely be equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change.

An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements has
not yet been fully completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance
sheet, as required by IFRS 16, an increase in the balance sheet total is expected at the point of initial
application. In accordance with the currently existing leasing agreements and the currently available
investigation results, an accounting of use of rights in the amount of approximately A40 million as well as
recognition of leasing obligations in the total amount of A40 million is expected. Instead of leasing
expenses, as a result of amendments to IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest
expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on the EBITDA.
Nidda, pursuant to the current status of the investigation, assumes that the depreciation of the currently
existing leasing agreements will in future amount to approximately A40 million. In addition, Nidda expects
future interest expenses in the amount of approximately A10 million. In accordance with the previous
requirements of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’, these expenses would have been fully recognized in operating profit as a
leasing expense and as a reduction of EBITDA. The changeover effect relates for the most part to leased
real estate, company vehicles as well as office and business equipment.

Furthermore, in May 2017, IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’’ was issued by the IASB,
through which a clarification of the requirements of the approach and measurement of uncertain earnings
positions arose. According to this, a company within the scope of the assessment of the uncertainty must
estimate how probable the acceptance of the tax treatment of business transactions in the respective tax
jurisdictions is. The interpretation is to be applied for financial years which begin on or after January 1,
2019, whereby earlier application is permitted. Nidda currently finds itself in the evaluation on the impact
of IFRIC 23 on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are
expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

There were no changes to accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of net
assets, financial position and results of operations or cash flow in financial year 2018.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Nidda German
Topco GmbH and are therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if Nidda German Topco GmbH or its
subsidiaries are in control of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over
existing rights, are able to substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually
substantiated by a share of voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which Nidda German Topco GmbH can have significant direct or indirect
influence and are not subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements using the equity method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net
assets, financial position and results of operations of the Nidda Group is insignificant, are not consolidated
or accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for at amortized
cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet total of these companies make up
about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates included in financial year 2018 and are as follows:

In the reporting year, the Russian subsidiary ZAO Makiz-Pharma was merged with the Russian subsidiary
OOO Hemofarm on May 24, 2018 under the continued company name OOO Hemofarm.

In addition, the Hungarian company STADA Hungary LLC was founded on March 26, 2018. Since
September 30, 2018, the company has been consolidated as a subsidiary.

Since September 30, 2018, STADA has consolidated BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, previously
included as an associate, as a subsidiary after successfully acquiring additional shares. The subsidiary of

BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, NorBiTec GmbH has also been treated as a subsidiary in the
Consolidated Financial Statements since September 30, 2018.

On December 29, 2018, the business combination of the two Russian subsidiaries OOO STADA Marketing
and ZAO Skopinpharm into the Russian subsidiary OOO Hemofarm took place under the continuation of
the company name OOO Hemofarm.

In addition, the two subsidiaries Socialites Retail Germany GmbH and Socialites Nederlands B.V. were
de-consolidated as of December 31, 2018.

In the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Nidda Group, 83 companies were consolidated as
subsidiaries and four companies as associates as of the reporting date on December 31, 2018.

As in the previous year, the two French companies Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS as well as the
Russian Dialogfarma LLC were recognized as associates in accordance with the equity method in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the former Vietnamese subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was signed in the last quarter of
2017 for the sale of the shares held by in the company as of December 31, 2019. This was associated with
the loss of control in this company. The company has since been consolidated as an associate in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full—
irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the
historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the
acquiree, Nidda recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the
period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a
revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares
of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, because it is a transaction between the
equity investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between
the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value
adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the
IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when
joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and
carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A
positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the
carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the
period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests.

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (Continued)**

If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of Nidda German Topco GmbH is the euro and represents the reporting currency
of the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing
rate and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the
resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the
period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in
equity in the ‘‘Provisions for currency translation’’. These provisions are released and recognized in income
if Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

The exchange rate development of currencies important to Nidda to the euro can be seen in the following
chart:

**STADA takeover in 2017—Finalizing the purchase price allocation**

In financial year 2017 with the takeover of the STADA Arzneimittel AG, a significant business
combination in accordance with IFRS 3 occurred. The execution of the takeover offer was subject to the
condition, among other things, that a minimum acceptance threshold of 63% be reached by the acceptance
period on August 16, 2017. On expiration of the acceptance period, a total of 63.77% of the issued STADA
shares had been submitted for sale, so that the minimum acceptance threshold was reached. The
fulfillment date of the resulting purchase contracts, as a result of which the Nidda Healthcare Holding AG
(now operating as a GmbH) received ownership of these shares, was August 22, 2017 which is therefore to
be regarded as the date of acquisition.

The further acceptance period for the takeover offer ended upon expiration of September 1, 2017. Upon
expiry of the further acceptance period an additional 0.11% of the issued STADA shares were submitted
for sale. The concluded contracts of sale were fulfilled on September 15, 2017, whereby Nidda Healthcare

Holding AG (now operating as GmbH) acquired ownership of these additional STADA shares. Between
August 21 and August 23, 2017, Nidda Healthcare Holding AG (now operating as GmbH) acquired further
STADA shares via the Frankfurt stock exchange (XETRA�). Given the immediate continuity of the
extended acceptance period and the temporal proximity of the acquisitions via the stock exchange to the
acquisition date, these share acquisitions were included in the acquisition costs of A2,704.7 million. The
transaction costs amounted to A90.0 million.

In terms of the financing of the acquisition of the STADA Arzneimittel AG, the Nidda Group first utilized
equity commitments provided by the sponsors, a syndicated loan agreement and two bridge loans. The
equity commitments of the sponsors were contributed indirectly via intermediate holding companies to the
Nidda German Topco GmbH, partly by way of a capital contribution and additional payments into the
capital reserve and partly by way of shareholder loans and similar instruments. The syndicated loan
agreement was concluded on August 17, 2017 and grants a secured loan (‘‘Term Loan’’) callable in several
tranches and currencies in a total nominal amount of initially up to A1,700.0 million and a secured
revolving credit facility of up to A400.0 million (‘‘RCF’’). The bridge loans, also concluded on August 17,
2017, consisted of a secured syndicated loan with a nominal value of A485.0 million (‘‘SSN Bridge’’) and a
partially secured syndicated loan with a nominal value of A340.0 million (‘‘SUN Bridge’’). The acquisition
of the shares of the STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the takeover bid was then financed, in
addition to the equity commitments, by drawdowns of Term Loan in the amount of A250.0 million, of the
RCF in the amount of A37 million and the complete drawdown of both bridge loans.

On September 29, 2017, the bridge loans were refinanced as planned by long-term bonds. For this purpose,
Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued a bond with a volume of A735.0 million and an interest rate of
3.5% p.a. (‘‘SSN Bond’’). In parallel, Nidda Bondco GmbH issued a bond with a volume of A340.0 million
and an interest rate of 5% p.a. (‘‘First SUN Bond’’). The net proceeds of the bond issues were used for the
full repayment of the bridge loans and for an allocation to a special account for the future acquisition of
additional STADA shares, refinancing of existing debt financing of the Group and other purposes
permitted under the syndicated loan agreement.

The STADA Group was included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda German
Topco GmbH for the first time as of August 31, 2017. In the Consolidated Financial Statements as of
December 31, 2017, the purchase price allocation was considered on a provisional basis. The purchase
price allocation was finalized in the interim and was included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as
of December 31, 2018 accordingly. The adjustments required as a result of the finalization also had an
impact on the data of the financial statements as disclosed in these Consolidated Financial Statements for
the comparative period 2017. This explains the deviations of comparative figures in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the 2018 financial year with information contained in the Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared as of December 31, 2017.

The amount estimated for the non-controlling interest is thus A1,150.9 million as of the acquisition date.

Compared to the preliminary purchase price allocation in the financial year 2017, the final purchase price
allocation had a positive effect on earnings before taxes in the amount of A47.2 million. This effect was
mainly due to the reduced burden in the cost of sales in the amount of A17.0 million, due to reduced
impairments on receivables and intangible assets in the amount of A18.3 million in other operating
expenses as well as reduced charges in the recognition of provisions and other liabilities in the amount of
A7.9 million.

The cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities has not changed
between the final and the preliminary purchase price allocation.

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used to measure the acquired assets
and assumed liabilities.

Sales generated by the STADA Group amounted to around A2,330.8 million in financial year 2018. The
result after taxes of this business combination amounted to around A310.5 million in the reporting year.

On October 11, 2018, Nidda Healthcare GmbH published a public de-listing tender offer for all
outstanding STADA shares after obtaining the necessary approval from the German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (BaFin). On November 12, 2018, Nidda Healthcare GmbH announced that it held a
total of 93.61% of the issued STADA shares.

In order to partially finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered in the course of the de-listing
offer, Nidda BondCo GmbH issued a bond with a total volume of A250.0 million and an interest rate of
7.25% p.a. on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018 (‘‘Second SUN Bond’’). In addition, Nidda
Healthcare GmbH received an additional loan under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal
amount of A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility D’’).

**BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG**

On September 27, 2018, STADA obtained control of the German company BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel
AG, Bad Vilbel. The company manufactures the active ingredient Erythropoietin and markets it in
particular by issuing sales licenses to STADAPHARM and other third parties. BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG, which was previously included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as an associate,
and its subsidiary NorBiTec GmbH have been included as subsidiaries in consideration of minority
interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements, with effect as of September 30, 2018. Control was
obtained as a result of acquiring an additional 35.48% of the shares from co-shareholders, whereby
STADA, together with the shares it already held, holds 51.34% of the shares in BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG and is therefore the company’s majority shareholder. The purchase price for the
acquisition of A35.0 million was fully paid in cash. The acquisition took place on September 27, 2018,
following approval of the purchase agreement concluded in August 2018 by the competition authorities.

The final purchase price allocation led to substantial changes in comparison to the reported preliminary
purchase price allocation reported as of September 30, 2018. These were attributable primarily to the
valuation of immaterial assets. As a consequence, this business combination, which is to be regarded as a
bargain purchase, resulted in a negative goodwill of A27.6 million.

The revaluation of the shares recognized using the equity method up to the time of acquisition led to a loss
in the amount of A1.2 million at the time control was obtained, which was reported in other income.

The negative goodwill was recognised in other income. Based on the negative goodwill determined as part
of the purchase price allocation, the procedures used to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets
and liabilities assumed were reviewed again. In this context, it was ensured that all information available at
the time of acquisition was adequately taken into account in the valuation.

The share relating to non-controlling shareholders in the acquired company determined at the time of
acquisition as part of the purchase price allocation is A74.2 million. This corresponds to a share of 48.66%
in the net assets of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, which is derived from the fair value of the assets
and liabilities at the time of acquisition.

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used to measure the acquired assets
and assumed liabilities.

The gross amount of trade accounts receivable was A23.4 million which was considered fully recoverable.
Trade accounts receivable were recognized at their fair value in the amount of A23.4 million.

In the three months since the time of initial consolidation, sales of the BIOCEUTICALS Group amounted
to approximately A4.2 million. Operating profit of this business combination adjusted for effects from the
purchase price allocation (approximately A4.4 million) amounted to approximately A0.3 million in the
reporting year. Had STADA purchased the BIOCEUTICALS Group on January 1, 2018, sales of
approximately A16.8 million and operating profit of approximately A1.2 million adjusted for effects from
the purchase price allocation (approximately A17.6 million) would have been achieved in 2018 on a
straight-line-basis.

Before the acquisition of the addition shares in BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, there were business
relationships with STADA through the subsidiary STADAPHARM that previously marketed the active
ingredient Erythropoietin through license use.

**9. Accounting policies**

Nidda’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these
are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and which are described in more detail below insofar as they are significant for the
Consolidated Financial Statements or for which option rights are exercised.

F-105

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Sales are recognized when the control over delimitable goods passes to the customer, meaning that the**
customer is able to determine the use of the delimitable goods and, essentially, derive benefit from them.
As a requirement for this, there must be an agreement with enforceable rights and obligations and, inter
alia, a consideration must be highly likely. The creditworthiness of the customer must be considered in this
instance. The amount of sales is based on the transaction price to which Nidda is expected to be entitled.
Variable considerations that are only considered if it is highly likely that this will not lead to a significant
reversal of sales should there no longer be any uncertainty regarding the variable consideration, have an
influence on the expected transaction price. The amount of the variable consideration is therefore
determined using the expected value method.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated
amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated
expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health
insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective contract in
force.

All license agreements of Nidda are either bound to the realized sales of the licensee or further activities
are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. The realization
of sales is thus distributed over the periods of the contractual term.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses
related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods
(e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead costs (e.g. scheduled depreciation of production
equipment and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value adjustments of excess or obsolete
inventories.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process is to obtain national or multinational regulatory drug
approval. Downstream from the development process is an evaluation process at the end of which a
decision on the actual execution of a development is made. Within the development process itself,
development costs relative to approvals for new drugs result in capitalization as intangible assets if all the
following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to
become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use
(i.e. usually to market it oneself) or sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

Development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense are immediately recognized in the periods in
which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
marketed.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a market region within
the two operating segments of the Group for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill.

Nidda plans to carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews
also take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying

F-106

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

amount of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in
use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order to
determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions,
investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made
individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on
internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications
that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses
are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an
impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized
cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of
these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. At Nidda, this affects the capitalized umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco, and the
capitalized umbrella brand Vannier. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with
indefinite useful lives at the level of the individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the
level of the individual companies that generate sales under the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible
assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests.
Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing
an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized
development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of
individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs.
Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally
20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied due to a lack of relevance. To the

F-107

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are reversed if the reasons
for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original historical
costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, Nidda assesses whether
indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for the two operating segments with
specific parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under ‘‘Other expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units are defined at the level of individual assets within the reportable segments of
Branded Products and Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods),**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at
the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of sales are determined based on
weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and
overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on
production facilities. Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the
period in which they occur. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be divided into the following categories in accordance with IFRS 9: Measurement at**
amortised cost (‘‘AC’’), financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘‘FVPL’’) and financial assets at
fair value through other comprehensive income (‘‘FVOCI’’). Financial assets are accounted for and
measured in accordance with IFRS 9. This involves classifying a financial asset on the basis of its
contractual cash flow characteristics and business model. Under IFRS 9, a financial asset is carried at cost
if the underlying business model is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (business
model condition). In addition, the cash flow condition must be satisfied. This is the case when the
contractual features of the financial asset at specified times only provide for interest and principal
payments on the outstanding principal amount.

Receivables eligible for factoring are included in trade accounts receivable. Based on the present business
model, they are measured at fair value recorded directly in equity. Changes in the fair value of these
receivables are therefore recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets measured at
fair value recorded directly in equity are generally subject to the same impairment model as financial assets
measured at amortized cost.

In accordance with IFRS 9, expected losses are accounted for on the basis of the expected credit loss
model. The simplified approach is applied for trade accounts receivable and return assets. The general
approach is generally applied to other financial assets.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the

F-108


-----

**Notes (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

expected default risk, the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by debtor are determined.
To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of
receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account.

In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to be taken into
consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces the assets’
carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values. These financial liabilities
are reported in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item.

Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging
instruments are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the fair value change of
the hedged underlying transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in
addition to the fair value change in the derivative, the opposing fair value change in the underlying
transaction is recognized in profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the hedged risk.

No use is made of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to
be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated
Financial Statements is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, Nidda
makes estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other
factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and
assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual
circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting
issues concerned are detailed below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

Nidda carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain
assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Assets’’ to the carrying amounts of the respective cash-generating units and an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Costs’’ are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on the basis of individual
appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific
estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The budget
values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal
developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined in the
context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of
impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an
impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

Nidda makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

Nidda operates in various countries and must pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order
to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well
as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and
their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the
final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding effect on actual and
deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in the respective
period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the Nidda Group is being allotted to a comprehensive
tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of
these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement
procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the
biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific
mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The
discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed
interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds,
the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. Provisions are created if there is a present external obligation and a
probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on estimates of the prospects of success of these methods. The
determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due
to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual

F-110

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

Sales are generated exclusively in the STADA (sub)Group and are based primarily on the supply of
products and, to a lesser extent, from license revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please
refer to the details included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2018, achieved sales were A2,330.8 million (previous year: A824.9 million).

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in E k** **2018** **2017**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 993,033 510,650

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A289,2 million (previous year: A96.7 million)
mainly included amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a necessary condition
for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with
reversals. Reversals amounted to A9.4 million in financial year 2018.

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and the sales force, selling expenses also comprise the costs
for advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for
logistics that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called
discounts in kind—if possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not included. The
resulting expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing costs of A239.0 million (previous year: A94.8 million) corresponded to a
share of 44% in selling expenses (previous year: 47%). In addition, selling expenses included depreciation
in the amount of A7.4 million (previous year: A2.5 million).

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2018, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A6.1 million
(previous year: A2.1 million).

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details
included in Accounting Policies.

The research and development expenses included depreciation in the amount of A2.4 million (previous
year: A0.7 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A20.4 million were capitalized in
financial year 2018 (previous year: A7.8 million).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

**in E k** **2018** **2017**

Income from the reversal of impairments on receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10,636 7,234

In the financial year, impairments on receivables in the amount of A10.6 million were reversed (previous
year: A7.2 million).

In addition, other income in the year under review included net currency translation income of A1.1 million
(previous year: net currency translation expenses of A0.9 million), which consisted of currency translation
income of A48.9 million (previous year: A9.9 million) and currency translation expenses of A47.8 million
(previous year: A10.8 million).

The remaining other income mainly included income from the capital consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG and other income that cannot be directly allocated to the functional costs and which is
made up of many immaterial individual items in the Group companies.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

**in E k** **2018** **2017**

Expenses from valuation allowances on accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,523 16,113
Currency translation expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 928

Impairment losses on goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — —
Losses from the disposal of non-current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,140 6,892
Remaining other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37,947 42,336

Other expenses include impairment losses of A85.6 million (previous year: A16.1million) that only concern
impairment losses on current assets excluding goodwill in the reporting year. These impairment losses
mainly relate to intangible assets. The impairment losses relate to various pharmaceutical approvals and
trademarks, the scheduled amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

In other expenses, in the reporting year there are expenses from impairments on receivables in the amount
of A15.5 million (previous year: A16.1 million), which for the most part relate to impairments due to
payment defaults of customers in Russia.

Losses from the disposal of non-current assets in the previous year were essentially due to the following
circumstance: For the subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., an agreement was concluded on the sale of the
shares held by STADA in this company as of December 31, 2019. For STADA, this was associated with the
loss of control in this company. The company will now be consolidated as an associate in the Consolidated

F-112

**Notes (Continued)**

**17. Other expenses (Continued)**

Financial Statements until the time of the sale. In connection with the loss of control in this company,
there was a loss in the total of A5.5 million. This resulted in a positive effect from the reversal of the
currency translation reserve in the amount of A1.2 million.

Within remaining other expenses, personnel expenses are recognized in the amount of A3.9 million
(previous year: A9.5 million) which in the reporting year resulted from severance payments to formet
Executive Board members as well as expenses relating to changes in management. The recurring personnel
expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective specialist departments. The severance payments
mainly related to employees whose regular personnel expenses were included in general and administrative
expenses.

In the previous year, consulting services in connection with the 2017 takeover by Bain Capital and Cinven
in the amount of A17.1 million, which were considered a special item in the financial year, were included in
this item. Other consulting expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective specialist departments.

**18. Financial result**

The **result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2018 relates to the companies Pharm**
Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS as well as Dialogfarma LLC and are accounted for using the equity
method. The result from investments measured at equity also contained the share to be attributed to this
company up to the time at which BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG was fully consolidated.

**Investment income primarily relates to profit distributions from companies not included in the Consolidated**
Financial Statements.

**Financial income and financial expenses are composed of the interest result and other financial income and**
other financial expenses. The interest result developed as follows:

**in E k** **2018** **2017**

Interest income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17,755 2,270

with IFRS 9:

- loans and receivables (AC) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,079 1,427

- financial assets and liabilities at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) . . . . . . . �1,564 n/a

- financial liabilities measured at amortized costs (AC) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �305,255 �63,772

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2018 included a net interest expense from other
non-current provisions, which comprises interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from
pension obligations and other non-current provisions, in the amount of A0.8 million (previous
year: A0.3 million).

In financial year 2018, the Group refinanced itself at interest rates of between 0.95% p.a. and 7.25% p.a.
(previous year: between 2.9% p.a. and 5.5% p.a.). As of the balance sheet date December 31, 2018, the
weighted average interest rate for non-current financial liabilities was approximately 4.31% p.a. (previous
year: approximately 4.34% p.a.). As of the balance sheet date December 31, 2018, the weighted average
interest rate for current financial liabilities was approximately 1.97% p.a. (December 31, 2017:
approximately 1.79% p.a.). The weighted average interest rate for all of the Group’s financial liabilities was
approximately 4.11% p.a. (2017: 3.47% p.a.).

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A2.6 million (previous year:
A0.5 million) in financial year 2018. A capitalization rate of 2.5% (previous year: 1.6%) for intangible assets
was taken as a basis.

The result from the measurement of financial instruments in the reporting year was a result of interest rate
sway valued at fair value through profit or loss. The measurement of interest rate hedge transactions
thereby depends on the development of the money market interest rate.

The result in the previous year was a result of the interest rate/currency swaps valued at fair value through
profit or loss that expired as scheduled in 2017.

**19. Income tax expenses**

The item income taxes includes taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as
well as deferred tax liabilities. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to the sales,
administration or research and development functions are included in other expenses.

Actual income taxes recognized in the income statement can be divided according to timing as follows:

**in E k** **2018** **2017**

**Actual income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **68,223** **13,529**

No effective income tax rate is reported for 2018, as a tax expense had to be reported despite a pre-tax loss,
in particular due to restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses (previous year: 10.2%). The nominal
income tax rate for financial year 2018 for Nidda German Topco GmbH in Germany amounted to 28.32%
(previous year: 31.9%), including corporate tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the solidarity surcharge in the
amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 357% (previous year: 460%).

No deferred tax liabilities were formed for temporary differences from undistributed earnings from
subsidiaries in the amount of A22.4 million (previous year: A17.6 million), because these profits will be
reinvested for an indefinite period.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement
was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes. The

The tax effects from loss carryforwards/interest carryforwards mainly resulted from unrecognized deferred
tax assets on tax losses and interest carried forward due to non-deductible interest expenses (so-called
interest barrier rule) in Germany.

The other tax effects resulted mainly from effects of the STADA (sub)Group.

Deferred tax liabilities reported resulted mainly from deferred taxes in the context of business
combinations under IFRS 3. The reduction in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets compared with
the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization of intangible assets with purchase price
allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as from impairments on such assets.

Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under
‘‘Tax loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the
balance sheet date December 31, 2018 amounted to A72.7 million in financial year 2018 (previous year:
A25.7 million).

The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to

The average number of employees in the reporting year decreased by 6% to 10,247 (previous year: 10,886),
primarily due to the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam as of November 30, 2017. As of the balance sheet
date, the Group’s number of employees increased in 2018 by 2% to 10,416 (previous year: 10,176). This
increase was mainly based on the consolidation of the German company NorBiTec GmbH in the course of
the majority takeover of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG as well as the Hungarian STADA
Hungary LLC. In addition, the increase in the number of employees as of the balance sheet date was due
to the expansion of the marketing and sales division of the German subsidiary STADAPHARM GmbH
and the Spanish subsidiary Laboratorio STADA S.L.

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their
functional relevance, in financial year 2018 were A357.4 million (previous year: A129.3 million).

Additions from business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3, which relate to the fair value calculated
in the context for the purchase price allocations resulted in the reporting year from BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG and NorBiTec GmbH.

In the Group, the umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco and Laboratorio Vannier are
included as recognized trademarks as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, as it is intended to
make continuing use of them. As of December 31, 2018, these umbrella brands have a carrying amount of
A51.6 million (STADA), A39.5 million (Hemofarm) and A8.8 million (Pymepharco). In the context of the
impairment test as at December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 1.5% was used for the umbrella brand STADA.
The royalty rate for Hemofarm and Pymepharco was 2%. The discount rate was 7.5% (STADA), 13.7%
(Hemofarm) and 14.3% (Pymepharco). There was no necessity for impairment in the reporting year.

The impairment test with a license rate of 2% and a discount rate of 17.8% for the umbrella brand
Laboratorio Vannier resulted in an impairment charge of A0.2 million for the reporting year. As of
December 31, 2018, the umbrella brand was thus completely written off and has a carrying amount of
A0.0 million.

The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of A15.2 million as of December 31, 2018, will be
amortized as scheduled over its useful life.

**23. Intangible assets (Continued)**

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2018 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A2.6 million (previous year: A0.5 million). In financial year
2018, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
2.5% (previous year: 1.6%).

Development costs of A23.7 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A8.6 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life (generally 20 years). Development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are
recognized immediately as expense in the period in which they are incurred. In financial year 2018, these
development costs amounted to of A72.3 million (previous year: A23.1 million).

Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is
recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an
amount of A267.7 million (previous year: A88.7 million).

In financial year 2018, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A85.6 million (previous year: A11.9 million). These impairments resulted primarily from the year-end
impairment tests. No valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation

In the context of the takeover of STADA Arzneimittel AG a goodwill arose in the amount of
A532.3 million due to the final purchase price allocation. The finalization of the purchase price allocation
therefore led to an adjustment of the goodwill in the amount of A171.3 million in comparison to the
amount of A703.6 million determined in the provisional purchase price allocation which was recognized in
the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017.[8] The STADA Group is managed as a
cash-generating unit in the Nidda Group, for this reason the goodwill impairment test is carried out at this
level.

8 Refer to section 8 in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the adjustments between the
provisional and final purchase price allocation.

**23. Intangible assets (Continued)**

As part of the regular impairment test for capitalized goodwill as of September 30, 2018, the expected cash
outflow was determined based on the discounted cash flow procedure using the following defined
parameters:

Growth in the 2018 update phase in % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5%
WACC 2018 in % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.9%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine value in use of the cash-generating units, applying
an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Such
a detailed planning period reflects the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the
period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of
50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year, for the period after the
three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected
long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for determining values in use is based on
certain assumptions that are based on past experience, complemented by internal developments, and
verified based on external market data and analyses. Key assumptions include the development of future
selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market
shares, foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. Significant changes to the aforementioned assumptions
would influence the determination of the values in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates
used are determined based on external factors derived from the market and are adjusted for the risks
predominant in the cash-generating units in question.

For the regular impairment test as of September 30, 2018 there was a headroom in the low triple-digit
million range. Changes to the valuation parameters for the impairment test can influence the value in use
of the cash-generating unit. A sensitivity analysis was therefore conducted for the cash-generating unit by
using a 1.0 percentage point increase of the discount rate, a 0.5 percentage point reduction of the growth
rate, and a 10.0 percentage point reduction of the EBIT. Based on these assumptions, there was a need for

**26. Investments measured at equity**

The disclosure relates to the accounting of shares in the associates STADA Vietnam J.V., as well as Pharm
Ortho Pedic SAS, AELIA SAS and Dialogfarma LLC using the equity method.

Due to an additional share acquisition and the associated gain of control, the former associate
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG has been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a
subsidiary since September 30, 2018.

For the former Vietnamese subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was signed in the last quarter of
financial year 2017 for the sale of the shares held by in the company as of December 31, 2019. This was
associated with the loss of control in this company. The company has since then been consolidated as an
associate in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the time of the sale.

Investments measured at equity developed as follows in financial year 2018 compared to the previous year:

The decline in investments measured at equity in financial year 2018 resulted primarily from the change in
status of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG from associate to subsidiary.

**26. Investments measured at equity (Continued)**

Interest rate effects exclusively related to STADA Vietnam J.V., as the equity carrying amount of the
company STADA Vietnam J.V. corresponds to the contractually agreed selling price for the shares held by
STADA for the sale as of December 31, 2019, taking into account a corresponding discounting effect.

Dividend distributions essentially included the dividends paid by STADA Vietnam J.V. for financial year
2018, which represent partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter
of 2017 to sell the shares in this company held by STADA.

As of December 31, 2018, there were no trade accounts receivable due after one year (previous year:
A0.2 million).

Collateral exists for a portion of trade accounts receivable whose value was not impaired in the form of
bank or corporate guarantees as well as pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit
insurance for certain markets and customers. These are taken into account in the calculation of the default
risk.

The new regulations on the classification of financial assets lead to changes in the measurement and
disclosure of factoring-capable receivables on the basis of the present business model. These financial
assets, which continue to be included in trade accounts receivable, are no longer measured at amortized
cost but at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these receivables
are therefore recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. In this context, financial assets measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income are generally subject to the same impairment model as
financialassets measured at amortized cost.

Overall, valuation allowances on trade accounts receivable developed as follows:

For trade accounts receivable, an expected default on receivables is calculated over their terms on the basis
of a portfoliospecific default rate. The default rate indicates the probability that a debtor will default within
a period of one year. The default rates consider the industry risks and the economic environment of the
respective country. Each cluster is allocated to a different bandwidth of expected default rates.

**28. Return Assets**

As of December 31, 2018, return assets due after one year amounted to A0.6 million. The return assets
relate to expected returns in connection with agreements with customers for which reutilization is
expected.

(previous year: A11.4 million). The decline is based on payments received for financial assets that had been
written-down. There were no outstanding amounts for non-impaired other financial assets.

Other assets comprise many insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

As of December 31, 2018, other financial assets included impairments in the amount of A6.5 million. There
were no outstanding amounts for non-impaired other financial assets as in the previous year.

**31. Inventories**

Inventories can be subdivided as follows:

**in E k** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**

Materials and supplies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 108,541 91,638

In financial year 2018, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of
inventories in the amount of A35.7 million (previous year: A25.7 million), which were already deducted
from the amounts shown above through profit and loss.

**32. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subject to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the respective
national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash equivalents
amounted to A2.2 million (previous year: A2.7 million) exclusively related to cash in China.

The development of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 at A360.7 million (previous year:
A474.8 million) resulted from the effects described as part of the explanations of the consolidated cash flow
statement. Further details on the development of cash and cash equivalents can be found in the
consolidated cash flow statement.

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities**

As of December 31, 2018, assets held for sale of A0.1 million (previous year: A1.8 million) were reported
under a separate item in the balance sheet.

In the previous year, this item included, among other things, a building from a German subsidiary that was
held for sale as well as an intangible asset from an Italian subsidiary held for sale.

**34. Equity**

Group equity amounted to A�369.8 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: A1,533.5 million).
This corresponds to an equity ratio of �5.4% (previous year: 21.7%).

**34. Equity (Continued)**

**34.1. Share capital and capital reserve**

Share capital amounted to A25,000 as of December 31, 2018 (previous year: A25,000) and was fully paid-up.

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and exclusively include the capital reserve of Nidda German Topco GmbH. The decrease by A517.4 million
of the capital reserve in financial year 2018 is related to the inital recording of a financial liability in the
amount of A1,586.5 million due to the conclusion of the DPLTA between Nidda Healthcare GmbH and
STADA Arzneimittel AG.

**34.2. Retained earnings including net result**

Retained earnings including net result comprise net result for financial year 2018. In addition,
re-valuations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized through other comprehensive
income are reported under this item, taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, the net result in the
amount of A0.9 million—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling interests—resulted from
the remeasurement (previous year: A1.2 million) after deferred tax liabilities. In addition, this position also
includes currency translation differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized in equity from
performance-oriented pension plans as well as the deferred taxes they incur which, in financial year 2018,
amounted to expenses recognized in equity of A0.03 million (previous year: A0.2 million).

**34.3. Other reserves**

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are reported in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve.

Due to the application of the new standard IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018, other reserves additionally
include the reserve FVOCI. Under this item, fair value changes of the fair value recognized through other
comprehensive income are accounted for without impact on profit or loss.

The decrease in other reserves in the reporting year resulted in particular from the depreciation of the
Russian ruble since December 31, 2017, as well as the resulting expenses from foreign currency translation
of the companies reporting in this currency.

**34.4. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares relating to non-controlling interests as of December 31, 2018 related to the minority interests of
other shareholders in the subsidiaries Hemofarm Banja Luka, Hemomont, Pymepharco, STADA
Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) and Well Light Investment Services. In addition, the consolidation of the two
subsidiaries BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and NorBiTec GmbH since September 2018 has resulted
in shares relating to non-controlling shareholders attributable to these companies being reported under
this item.

The minority interests held in STADA Arzneimittel AG that were included in the shares relating to
non-controlling shareholders no longer exist as of December 31, 2018. Recognizing the financial liability in
connection with the DPLTA led to these minority interests being derecognized in financial year 2018. As a
result of the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as a subsidiary in financial year 2017, there are no
longer any minority interests of other shareholders included in this item as of December 31, 2017.

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among other things, insurances, government bonds and securities funds.

In financial year 2018, the plan assets of one international subsidiary exceeded their pension obligations,
with the result that these assets in excess were reported under other assets as assets from overfunded
pension plans in the amount of A0.03 million (previous year: A0.02 million).

The past service cost in the reporting year amounts to a gain of A0.5 million and is largely attributable to
special events in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France. In the United Kingdom, the Supreme
Court in 2018 definitively confirmed a ruling that gender inequalities must be eliminated with respect to
guaranteed minimum pensions (GMPs) included in occupational pension plans. This resulted in past
service cost of A0.3 million. In Switzerland, the underlying group foundation has reduced the conversion
amounts from retirement capital to lifelong annuities. This resulted in a gain of A0.4 million for the
STADA Group. In France, a plan curtailment led to an additional gain in the amount of of A0.4 million. In
addition, there were other special events with an insignificant impact on the balance sheet.

The amount of the income from plan assets for German Group companies is largely determined by raising
the value of the plan assets of a commitment to the value of the gross obligation on the basis of the
reinsurance available for this purpose. This decreased as a result of the slight increase in the discount rate
in the 2018 financial year and thus had a reducing effect on income. The reduction in the income from plan
assets abroad is mainly due to a negative performance of plan assets in the United Kingdom and a
decrease in the income from plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the amount of plan assets
is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation and is therefore crucially dependent on the
development of the discount rate. In financial year 2018, the actuarial interest rate has risen. This has led
to a reduction in the obligation and the plan assets and thus the income.

The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and
pension costs:

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan assets, are expected in the amount of A0.8 million for German Group companies
and A3,7 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the
company. For the Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 84%. Accordingly, the following details
focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension
plans. Furthermore, regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The
retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired
employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In
the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as
a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation.

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A41.6 million and were composed of
three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally.
Further more, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the STADA Arzneimittel AG Executive Board
Hartmut Retzlaff was transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the
necessity remains, due to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit
plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing
plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan
amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions
are expected in the future.

Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that
the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands
is, in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned
requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement
or early death.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets
received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The
assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the
amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A25.6 million.

**Notes (Continued)**

**35. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest
rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of
investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the
contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should
change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future
contributions received.

Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees
have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the
evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the
insurance, the company could be required to make an additional contribution payment. In the calculation
of the amount of the pension obligations and plan assets, the assumptions of the AG forecast table 2018
were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality. Company-specific age-related annual fluctuation
rates serve as a fluctuation assumption.

In the United Kingdom, employees are provided with defined benefit plans that are concluded for new
hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plans are subject to the United Kingdom Trust Law and the United Kingdom Pension Regulator. The
pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also
responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to
cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate
and participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If
the discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional
contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to
expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A21.4 million. All assets have quoted market prices on
an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the
S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table
CMI 2015 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are
no longer relevant for the pension plan.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension
law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. The Group’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the
pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality
and fluctuation.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements
or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution
plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to
A26.9 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A8.9 million).

The financing agreements existing at the level of STADA Arzneimittel AG provide for a right of
repayment of bonds, promissory note loans or bank loans by the respective investors if a change of control
and a change in STADA’s rating occur. As a result of the acquisition in 2017, STADA expected that a
repayment could be made in the short term, which is why a corresponding disclosure of these financial
liabilities in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2017, with short-term maturity was made. After the
exercise option and the associated early repayment of due amounts expired in the first quarter of 2018,
non-opted financial liabilities were reclassified accordingly in this period to current and non-current
liabilities and the non-prematurely reduced financing agreements were assigned to their original terms on
the balance sheet. STADA Arzneimittel AG and certain material subsidiaries (in accordance with the
instructions given by the majority shareholder Nidda Healthcare GmbH) have provided certain collateral
to secure capital market liabilities and other financial liabilities assumed by Nidda and its affiliated
companies (including STADA) or for which Nidda and its affiliated companies (including STADA) have
provided collateral. The provision of these collateral securities results in the holders of the bonds having
the right to redeem the nominal amount and accrued interest under STADA bonds. The bond is therefore
classified as current.

In order to partially finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the purchase offer,
Nidda BondCo GmbH issued a bond with a total volume of A250.0 million and an interest rate of 7.25%
p.a. on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018 (‘‘Second SUN Bond’’). In addition, Nidda
Healthcare GmbH received an additional loan under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal
amount of A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility D’’).

Bridge loans concluded for the acquisition of STADA Arzneimittel AG with a nominal volume of
A485.0 million and A340.0 million were refinanced in financial year 2017 through two long-term bonds with
a nominal volume of A735.0 (‘‘SSN bond’’) and A340.0 million (‘‘First SUN Bond’’).

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure,
financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in
foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from
operating activities amounted to A231.4 million in the reporting year (previous year: A72.0 million).

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the proceeds from
disposals. This amounted to A�300.3 million in the reporting year (previous year: A�2,465.8 million). In
financial year 2018, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets amounted to A280.3 million (previous
year: A17.6 million), of which A255.4 million (previous year: A12.1 million) were attributable to payments
for significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio.

Cash flow from investing activities was characterized by payments for investments in intangible assets,
which mainly related to the acquisition of the rights to the medical dandruff shampoo Nizoral� for the
EMEA region and the reacquisition of the trademark rights to the sunscreen Ladival�. In the context of
business combinations, there were net inflows from the acquisition of the majority interest in
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents acquired at the time of
acquisition exceeded the purchase price.

Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies related to dividends of STADA Vietnam
J.V., which is accounted for using the equity method. They represent partial payments in connection with
the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell the shares in this company held by STADA
as of December 31, 2019.

**Notes (Continued)**

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement (Continued)**

The development in the previous year was significantly influenced by payments for the takeover of STADA
Arzneimittel AG. The payments made through this business combination for the acquisition of the shares
totaled A2,434.5 million in 2017. Included in that is the cash taken over at the time of the acquisition in the
amount of A270.2 million, which has already been deducted.

Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A�45.7 million in financial year 2018 and encompasses
payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution payments as well as additions to
shareholders’ equity (previous year: A2,883.1 million).

In order to finance the shares in STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the purchase offer, Nidda
BondCo GmbH issued the Second SUN Bond with a volume of A250.0 million on December 4, 2018 and
December 13, 2018. In addition, Nidda Healthcare GmbH received an additional loan under the
syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of A705 million on November 27, 2018 (‘‘Facility
D’’). Conversely, cash flow from financing activities includes payments of A1,447.0 million made in
connection with the delisting tender offer as a change in minority interests. Furthermore, in the second
quarter of 2018, a bond issued by STADA Arzneimittel AG in the amount of A347.1 million took place and
was repayed according to schedule.

In the previous year, the development of cash flow from financing activities was influenced by the financing
measures—particularly the drawing of the first loan facilities under the syndicated loan agreement—in
connection with the acquisition of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Additionally, Nidda BondCo GmbH issued
the SSN Bond with a nominal value of A735.0 million and Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued the
First SUN Bond with a nominal volume of A340.0 million. In addition, in 2017 the loan in the amount of
A1,002.7 million issued by Nidda Midco S.`a.r.l was included in cash flow from financing activities.

Payments for dividend distributions amounted to A4.5 million (previous year: A15.6 million). They relate
primarily to the dividend paid to the non-controlling shareholders of STADA Arzneimittel AG for
financial year 2017.

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities
amounted to A�68.9 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A2,393.8 million).

Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

Free cash flow, adjusted for effects from payments for significant investments and acquisitions and effects
of proceeds from significant disposals is calculated as follows:

**44. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations to third parties based on past events but which will not
become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not under Nidda’s
control. As of the balance sheet date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are
therefore not accounted. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for which
however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the obligation
cannot be adequately estimated.

F-148

**Notes (Continued)**

**44. Contingent liabilities (Continued)**

Contingent liabilities relate, among other things, to patent risks for certain active pharmaceutical
ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The resulting possible obligations
amounted to approximately A31.0 million (previous year: A11.6 million). The development as compared to
the previous year is mainly due to a change in the assessment of the level of anticipated outflows of
resources for patent risks already existing in the previous year in the amount of A21.7 million. In addition,
possible obligations resulting from a ban on economic activities between Russia and Ukraine no longer
apply.

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under
50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**45. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations, which can be
broken down as follows:

**in E k** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48,743 54,861

Liabilities from operating leases relate, among other things, to IT equipment and vehicles. In addition,
there are liabilities from long-term rental agreements for office buildings with an average contract term of
5 years (previous year: 5 years).

Total future minimum leasing payments based on operating leases amounted to A48.7 million at the end of
the financial year (previous year: A54.9 million) and is comprised as follows after their remaining terms:

**Operating leases**
**in E k** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**

Lease payments in the amount of A34.6 million were recognized as an expense in financial year 2018
(previous year: A10.6 million).

Due to a status change of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG from a company accounted for using the
equity method to a fully consolidated subsidiary as of September 30, 2018, the guarantee amounting to
A25.0 million towards Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, in connection with a supply agreement
between Hospira and the shares in the associate BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG as of December 31,
2018 is not included in other financial liabilities anymore (previous year: A25.0 million).

Other financial obligations include long-term obligations for logistics services. In addition, bona fide
contingent liabilities in the amount of A28.3 million in Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom and further
guarantees assumed are included in other financial liabilities.

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short residual terms, their
carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to their fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of
promissory note loans, bonds, liabilities to banks as well as liabilities to shareholders. The cash flows
calculated by means of the current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the
fair values for liabilities to credit institutes.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables and of financial investments held until maturity with a
remaining term of less than one year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade accounts payable as well as remaining financial
liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair
values.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, the allocation to the respective hierarchy
levels is reviewed according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If a need for
reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period.
In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (currency swaps and interest rate swaps, in the previous
year currency and interest swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards
are determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable
information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized
procedures. In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by
external third parties.

In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB), (EUR/DKK), (EUR/CHF), (EUR/USD) and (EUR/GBP)
are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from intercompany loans
with companies that keep their accounting in a local currency other than euros. The changes in value of the
underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by
the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the
currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging. The effectiveness of the
hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the
closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result. Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from interest rate swaps, and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value through profit or
loss, which are reported under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the currency
translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other income or other
expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to the fulfillment currency swaps.

**46.3. Factoring**

**Factoring transactions with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks**

There are revolving receivable selling agreements with banks and financial institutes (together ‘‘receivables
buyers’’) with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks for two agreements without a general
purchase limit and for one agreement with a purchase limit of A17.5 million. The agreements have an
unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby Nidda is free to decide if and in what
amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk evaluation with
regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk).
In return for a fixed program fee recognized in expenses at the time of derecognition, both risks are fully
transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The nominal volume of receivables sold but not yet paid under
the factoring agreements amounted to A38.0 million on the reporting date.

**Factoring transactions with distribution of essential opportunities and risks for which control of the**
**asset remains with the Nidda Group**

There are factoring agreements pursuant to which, on a revolving basis, trade accounts receivable up to a
total general purchase limit of A135.6 million are sold to banks and financial institutes. The agreements
have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby the Nidda Group is free to decide if
and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk
evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late
payment risk). The credit risk is partially transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The late payment risk
continues to be borne in its entirety. The maximum credit risk to be borne, translated into euro, amounted
to A1.3 million as of the reporting date. The other credit-risk related defaults are assumed by the buyer.
The late payment risk continues to be borne in its entirety by the Group. The maximum risk of loss for the
Group resulting from the credit risk and the late payment risk from the receivables sold as of the reporting
date, translated into euro, amounted to A1.4 million. The nominal volume of receivables sold but not yet
paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to A51.7 million on the reporting
date. The ongoing commitment of the Group as of December 31, 2018, translated into euro, amounted to
A1.4 million and the carrying amount of the associated liability, translated into euro, amounted to
A1.4 million.

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments**

**47.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Management in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all transactions
above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Management must first be approved by the
Management. The Management is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount of current
risks.

**47.2. Currency risks**

The balance sheet and Group currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, the Group is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

F-154


-----

**Notes (Continued)**

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments (Continued)**

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

However, the Group is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency risks
hrough, alongside natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge
currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, use
was made of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures
contracts are adjusted to the term of the underlying transactions. The remaining term of the contracts is
currently up to one year.

In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations
lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the
conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency
than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally
negative and depreciation is generally positive.

Determined quantitative disclosures were made on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In the case of hedging transactions, they are compared with the
balances of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material
outstanding foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the
foreign currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison with the
respective functional currency are as follows:

In this regard, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

**Notes (Continued)**

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments (Continued)**

The outstanding foreign currency items British pounds relate to a balance from foreign currency holdings
from German and international Group companies in British pounds and outstanding foreign currency
reserves in euro. For the Serbian dinar this relates to a balance from foreign currency holdings at
international Group companies in euro. The outstanding foreign currency reserves in Kazakhstani tenge
and Ukrainian hryvnia relate to a balance from international Group companies in euro and outstanding
foreign currency reserves in Kazakhstani tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia. The reported outstanding foreign
currency positions in US dollars relate exclusively to foreign currency holdings in US dollars at German
and international Group companies. The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves
in euro, from the Group’s perspective, results from the functional currency of the respective international
Group company. Overall, based on outstanding foreign currency items as of the reporting date, an
appreciation or a devaluation of the respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of
relevance for the Group would have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of
A25.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million) or in the amount of earnings of A25.9 million (previous year:
A2.2 million).

**47.3. Interest rate risks**

Interest risks from the investment of financial assets as well as financial debts, stand primarily in Euro.

In 2018, an average of 47% (previous year: 87%) of financial liabilities denominated in euro had fixed
interest rates. Currently there are no cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps.

Existing interest rate risks are calculated using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors—if relevant—are generally included in the calculation:

- Changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are
not hedged against interest rate risks, and

- Changes in the market interest rate of interest derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

The interest-rate risk is of secondary importance.

**47.4. Default risks**

The Group is exposed to a default risk in its operating business if contracting parties fail to meet their
obligations. Alongside the implementation of appropriate credit management processes, such transactions
are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing to avoid default risks in
financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. Business relations are sought only
with partners of impeccable financial standing. In addition, the Group partly uses suitable measures such
as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard itself against default risk. Past due
receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored and potential default risks are anticipated
through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that in a difficult economic
and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments to Group
companies or business partners of the Group and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default
risks arise.

**Notes (Continued)**

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments (Continued)**

The maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized.
In addition, the Group granted guarantees that amounted to a total nominal volume of A29.0 million as of
the reporting date (previous year: A63.1 million). Various forms of collateral for credit securities are held,
such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of receivables and pledged inventories.
Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets and customers.

**47.5. Liquidity risks**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of
liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of the Group at all times by maintaining
a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves. Financing is obtained through short-term and long-term
borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, the Group also has solid
operating cash flow.

**47.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

Currency risks are countered with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively used to hedge
interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities and financial transactions. Derivative
financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

The total volume of currency and interest rate related derivatives is comprised as follows:

In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB), (EUR/DKK), (EUR/CHF), (EUR/USD) and (EUR/GBP)
are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company
loans with companies that keep their accounting in a local currency other than euros. The changes in value
of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates, are
offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge
against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging. The
effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing
date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective. In the
reporting period, new fair value hedges with a nominal volume totaling A681.5 million were designated for
reduction of the fair value risk. As of December 31, 2018, currency derivatives with a net fair value of
A1,770k (previous year: A-566k) were designated as hedging instruments within the scope of fair value
hedges. Losses recognized in currency translation result in financial year 2018 of A4,088k resulted from the
carrying amount adjustment of the hedged item (previous year: A863k), from changes in fair values of the

The following auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Nidda German Topco GmbH as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2018. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at
December 31, 2018, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of
profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the
financial year from January 1 through December 31, 2018, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. We have also audited the group
management report of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, for the financial year from January 1
through December 31, 2018.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
§ [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial
position of the Group as at December 31, 2018, and of its financial performance for the financial year
from January 1 to December 31, 2018, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management
report.

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in
the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with provisions under German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**Other Information**

The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
annual report—excluding further cross-references to external information—, with the exception of the
audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report as well as our auditor’s
report. Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report
do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form
of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

F-162


-----

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibility of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group**
**Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position,
and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such
internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

F-163


-----

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements,
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Company’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

Group (hereafter referred to as ‘‘STADA’’), located at Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is an
internationally-oriented company based in Germany and active throughout the world in the health care
and pharmaceuticals markets, especially in the Generics and Branded Products segments.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2018 were approved
for publication by the Executive Board on March 13, 2019.

**2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements**

The Consolidated Financial Statements prepared for STADA Arzneimittel AG as parent company as of
December 31, 2018, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union
(EU), as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the
German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies
included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or non-current distinction.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
notes are shown in euro thousands (k A). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2018, STADA observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to
pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which were first applicable as of
January 1, 2018. Insofar as these changes have material effects on the presentation of STADA’s net assets,
financial position and results of operations or cash flows, these are described in detail below:

In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. The standard replaces IAS 39
and introduces new rules for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments.
Furthermore, IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. STADA applied the new standard for the
first time on January 1, 2018. There will be no adjustment of the previous year’s figures pursuant to the
transitional provisions of IFRS 9. Accordingly, the accumulative effect from the initial application of
IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018, was recorded in equity with no effect on profit or loss.

IFRS 9 has introduced a new model for the classification of financial assets. For debt instruments, these
are classified based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they
are held. As a consequence, financial instruments of the category ‘‘measured at amortized cost’’ (AC) are
reclassified to the category ‘‘measured at fair value through other comprehensive income’’ (FVOCI) or to
the category ‘‘measured at fair value through profit or loss’’ (FVPL).

Pursuant to IFRS 9, a financial asset is assessed at fair market value through other comprehensive income
if the underlying business model consists of holding the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and
to sell financial assets (business model qualification). In addition, the cash flow condition must be met.
This is the case when the contractual features of the financial assets at fixed times provide exclusively for
interest and discharge payments toward the outstanding principal.

The new regulations for the classification of financial assets have led to changes for the receivables that can
be factored in terms of their measurement and presentation as a result of the underlying business model.
These financial assets, which remain under trade accounts receivable, are no longer measured at amortized
cost, but at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Changes in the fair value of these receivables are therefore recognized directly in equity through other
comprehensive income in the FVOCI reserve. Meanwhile, financial assets that are recognized at fair value
through other comprehensive income are fundamentally subject to the same impairment model as the
financial assets recognized at amortized cost.

Under IFRS 9, equity instruments in general and derivatives are always recognized at fair value through
profit or loss. For equity instruments, IFRS 9 offers the choice to record changes in fair value under other
comprehensive income. STADA has not made use of this option to date.

Due to the new regulations on impairment, expected losses are recognized as expenses earlier under
IFRS 9. While under IAS 39 the incurred losses model was relevant for establishment of a risk provision,
under IFRS 9 they are based on the expected credit losses model. STADA applied the simplified approach
for trade accounts receivable. For other financial assets, the general approach is applied on principle. As a
result of the initial application of the impairment regulations in accordance with IFRS 9 as of January 1,
2018, the total amount of impairments increased by A2.7 million. The reconciliation of the risk provision
under IAS 39 to expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 is described below:

Country-specific loss probabilities are applied to determine expected credit losses under IFRS 9.

The changes made under IFRS 9 resulted in adjustments as of January 1, 2018 to the FVOCI reserve and
to the profit brought forward (not taking into account the amounts for shares relating to non-controlling
shareholders), which are described below:

In May 2014, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular
replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. STADA applied the new standard on
January 1, 2018 for the first time. In doing so, STADA made use of its right to choose simplified initial
application. Accordingly, the contracts that were not fully completed as of January 1, 2018 are accounted
for as if the new standard IFRS 15 were already applied when these contracts began so that the cumulative
effect from the change will be recognized directly in equity. There is no adjustment of the comparable
figures from the prior-year period.

Initial application of IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018 led to an augmenting cumulative effect of A0.4 million
that was recognized in retained earnings. The effect resulted primarily from the to be accounted contract
assets which in future are to be shown within the scope of return regulations and the deferred taxes to be
established as a result. Furthermore, application resulted in reclassification of A0.6 million of down
payments from trade accounts payable to contract liabilities. The new standard on revenue recognition will
thus has little impact on sales accounting, as sales are largely realized in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as a result of routine transactions. There are no agreements in the Group governing multiple
services in a contract or in several contracts (multi-element arrangements). There were also no changes
made in the accounting for license agreements, as they amounted to less than 2% of total sales in the 2017

financial year. All of STADA’s license agreements are either bound to the achieved sales of the licensee or
further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee.
If this were not the case for such license agreements, the result, due to the new IFRS 15 standard, future
sales would be realized in the amount of the entire license fee with the granting of a license and therefore
no longer, as they are presently, divided over the term of the license.

The effects of first-time application of the new IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards as of January 1, 2018 on
STADA’s consolidated balance sheet are described in condensed form below:

**The IASB has published the following IFRS standards that were not yet applied:**

In January 2016, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’, which determines the
recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (financial liabilities) associated with leases in the
balance sheet for lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating
leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier
application is permitted. STADA will apply the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and
thereby likely modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures will be waived. In this
context, the rights of use will likely be equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change.

An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements has
not yet been fully completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance
sheet, as required by IFRS 16, a significant increase in the balance sheet total is expected at the point of
initial application. Given the current lease agreements and the currently available study results, STADA
anticipates the recognition of rights of use in the amount of approximately A40 million and the recording of
lease obligations in the amount of A40 million. Instead of leasing expenses, as a result of amendments to
IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will be recorded in the income
statement—with a corresponding positive impact on the EBITDA. Based on the current status of the
study, STADA assumes that the write-downs of current lease agreements will in total amount to
approximately A40 million in future. In addition, STADA expects future interest expenses in the amount of
approximately A10 million. In accordance with the previous requirements of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’, these
expenses would have been fully recognized in operating profit as a leasing expense and as a reduction of

F-175

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued)**

EBITDA. The change-over effect relates at STADA for the most part to leased real estate, company
vehicles as well as office and business equipment.

Furthermore, in May 2017, IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’’ was issued by the IASB,
through which a clarification of the requirements of the approach and measurement of uncertain earnings
positions arose. According to this, a company within the scope of the assessment of the uncertainty must
estimate how probable the acceptance of the tax treatment of business transactions in the respective tax
jurisdictions is. The interpretation is to be applied for financial years which begin on or after January 1,
2019, whereby earlier application is permitted. STADA currently finds itself in the evaluation on the
impact of IFRIC 23 on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are
expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

There were no changes to accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of
STADA’s net assets, financial position and results of operations or cash flow in financial year 2018.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by STADA and are
therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if STADA Arzneimittel AG or its subsidiaries are in control of
an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to
substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of
voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which STADA can have significant influence and are not subsidiaries or
joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net
assets, financial position and results of operations of the STADA Group is insignificant, are not
consolidated or accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted at
amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet total of these companies
make up about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates included in financial year 2018 and are as follows:

For the former Vietnamese subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was signed in the fourth quarter of
2017 for the sale of the shares held in the company as of December 31, 2019. For STADA, this was
associated with the loss of control in this company. In accordance with IAS 28, the company will now be
consolidated as an associate in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the time of the sale. As a
result, the financial information of this company is no longer taken into account for the purposes of
inclusion as a subsidiary.

In addition, the two French companies Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS as well as the Russian
Dialogfarma LLC were recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as associates in accordance
with the equity method.

In the second quarter, the Russian subsidiary ZAO Makiz-Pharma was merged with the Russian subsidiary
OOO Hemofarm on May 24, 2018, retaining the name OOO Hemofarm.

In addition, the Hungarian company STADA Hungary LLC was re-constituted on March 26, 2018. The
company has been accounted for as a subsidiary since September 30, 2018.

STADA has been consolidating BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, formerly recognized as associated
company, as a subsidiary since September 30, 2018 following a successful increase of its stake. The
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG subsidiary NorBiTec GmbH is also included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements starting as of September 30, 2018.

On December 29, 2018, the business combination of the two Russian subsidiaries OOO STADA Marketing
and ZAO Skopinpharm into the Russian subsidiary OOO Hemofarm took place under the continuation of
the company name OOO Hemofarm.

In addition, the two subsidiaries Socialites Retail Germany GmbH and Socialites Nederlands B.V. were
deconsolidated as of December 31, 2018.

In the Consolidated Financial Statements of the STADA Group, 77 companies were consolidated as
subsidiaries and four companies as associates as of the reporting date on December 31, 2018.

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

In accordance with IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method.
Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full—
irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the
historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly-measured net assets of the
acquiree, STADA recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the
period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a

F-181


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (Continued)**

revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares
of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity
investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between
the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value
adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the
IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when
joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and
carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A
positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the
carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the
period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of STADA Arzneimittel AG is the euro and represents the reporting currency of
the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every reporting date, monetary items are translated using the closing rate
and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the
resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the
period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in
equity in ‘‘Provisions for currency translation’’. These provisions are released and recognized in income if
Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

**8. Business combinations**

In financial year 2018, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for
which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in greater detail below.

As of September 27, 2018 STADA assumed control of the German company BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG, Bad Vilbel. The company produces the active ingredient erythropoietin and markets it
primarily by issuing sales licenses to STADAPHARM and other third parties. BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG, which was previously included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as an associated
company, as well as its subsidiary NorBiTec GmbH, have been included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as subsidiaries since September 30, 2018 with consideration of minority interests. Assumption
of control occurred as a result of acquisition of an additional 35.48% of other shareholders shares, so that
STADA—together with the shares it already held—holds 51.34% of shares in BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG and is therefore the majority shareholder in the company. The purchase price for the
acquisition in the amount of A35.0 million was paid entirely in cash. The acquisition took place on
September 27, 2018 following approval by anti-trust authorities as per the purchase agreement concluded
in August of 2018.

Within the scope of the final purchase price allocation, there were significant changes as compared to the
preliminary purchase price allocation as of September 30, 2018. These are attributable in particular to the
measurement of intangible assets. Accordingly, a negative difference in the amount of A27.6 million arose
which is considered a bargain purchase and which resulted as follows:

**in E million**

Purchase price for 35.48% of the shares of the company approximately . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35.0
Fair value of shares at the time of purchase recorded per equity method . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15.6
Proportionate fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired approximately . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78.3
**Negative difference . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **27.6**

The revaluation of shares recorded in accordance with the equity method up to the time of purchase
resulted at the time control was acquired in an amount of A0.6 million, which was recorded in other
income.

The negative difference was recognised in other income. Based on the negative difference determined as
part of the purchase price allocation, the procedures used to determine the fair values of the identifiable
assets and liabilities assumed were reviewed again. In this context, it was ensured that all information
available at the time of acquisition had been adequately taken into account in the valuation.

The share of the company held by non-controlling shareholders determined at the time of purchase as part
of the purchase price allocation was A74.2 million. This corresponds to a 48.66% share of
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG net assets, which is derived from the fair value of assets and liabilities
at the time of purchase.

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the evaluation of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

The gross value of the trade accounts receivable is A23.4 million, which were deemed fully recoverable.
Trade accounts receivable were recorded at their fair value in the amount of A23.4 million.

Sales of the BIOCEUTICALS Group for the first three months since initial consolidation amounted to
approximately A4.2 million. The operating profit of this business combination adjusted for the effects of the
purchase price allocation (around A4.4 million) amounted to approximately A0.3 million in the reporting
year. If STADA had acquired the BIOCEUTICALS Group by January 1, 2018, progression on a
straight-line-basis in 2018 would have generated sales of approximately A16.8 million and operating profit
adjusted for effects from the purchase price allocation (approximately A17.6 million) of approximately
A1.2 million.

Even prior to the acquisition of additional shares of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, business relations
existed with STADA via the subsidiary STADAPHARM, which was already marketing the active
ingredient erythropoietin through the use of a license.

**9. Accounting policies**

STADA’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these
are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and which are described in more detail below insofar as they are significant for the
Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA or for which option rights are exercised.

**Sales are recorded when the power of disposition over delimitable goods is transferred to the customer so**
that the customer has the ability to determine the use of the delimitable goods and essentially derive
economic benefit from them. This requires that a contract with enforceable rights and duties be in place
and that, among other things, receipt of a consideration is highly likely. The customer’s creditworthiness
should be taken into consideration. The amount of sales is based on the transaction price to which STADA

F-184


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

is presumptively entitled. The anticipated transaction price is affected by variable considerations, which
should, however, be taken into consideration exclusively if it is highly likely that there will be no significant
retraction of sales upon elimination of uncertainty with respect to the variable consideration. The amount
of the variable consideration is determined by applying the anticipated value method.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated
amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated
expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health
insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective contract in
force.

All STADA license agreements either are bound to the sales generated by the licensee or further activities
of STADA are required which enable the licensee to use his or her right. As a consequence, sales are
realized over the terms of the contract period.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses
related to deferrals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods
(e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead costs (e.g. scheduled depreciation of production
equipment and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value adjustments of excess or obsolete
inventories.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process at STADA is to obtain national or multinational
regulatory drug approval. Downstream from the development process is an evaluation process at the end
of which a decision on the actual execution of a development is made. Within the development process
itself, development costs relative to approvals for new drugs obtained by STADA result in capitalization as
intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to
become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use
(i.e. usually to market it oneself) or sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

STADA immediately recognizes development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense in the periods
in which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
marketed.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a market region within
the two operating segments of the STADA Group for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill.

STADA carries out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also
take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount
of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in

F-185


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

use of the cash-generating unit. The dis-counted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order
to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions,
investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made
individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on
internally determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications
that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses
are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an
impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized
cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of
these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell is determined using the relief from royalty
method. At STADA, this affects the umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in the context of the acquisition
of the Hemofarm group, the umbrella brand Pymepharco capitalized in the context of achieving control
over Pymepharco, and the umbrella brand Vannier capitalized in the context of the acquisition of
Laboratorio Vannier. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives
at the level of the individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the level of the individual
companies that generate sales under the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible assets that are not yet
available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting
period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life
continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized
development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of
individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs.
Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally
20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation begins when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied at STADA due to a lack of
relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are
reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original historical
costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower than its carrying amount. At each reporting date, STADA assesses whether
indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for two operating segments with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under ‘‘Other expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units within the STADA Group are defined at the level of individual assets within the
reportable segments of Branded Products and Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods),**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at
the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of sales are determined based on
weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and
overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on
production facilities. Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the
period in which they occur. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be divided into the following categories in accordance with IFRS 9: Measurement at**
amortised cost (‘‘AC’’), financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘‘FVPL’’) and financial assets at
fair value through other comprehensive income (‘‘FVOCI’’). Financial assets are accounted for and
measured in accordance with IFRS 9. This involves classifying a financial asset (debt instrument) on the
basis of its contractual cash flow characteristics and business model. Under IFRS 9, a financial asset is
carried at cost if the underlying business model is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash
flows (business model condition). In addition, the cash flow condition must be satisfied. This is the case
when the contractual features of the financial asset at specified times only provide for interest and
principal payments on the outstanding principal amount.

Receivables eligible for factoring are included in trade accounts receivables. Based on the present business
model, they are measured at fair value recorded directly in equity. Changes in the fair value of these
receivables are therefore recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets measured at
fair value recorded directly in equity are generally subject to the same impairment model as financial assets
measured at amortized cost.

In accordance with IFRS 9, expected losses are accounted for on the basis of the expected credit loss
model. STADA has applied the simplified approach for trade accounts receivables and return assets. The
general approach is generally applied to other financial assets.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the
expected default risk, STADA determines the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by
debtor. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of

F-187


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to
be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces
the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values that are not part of an
effective hedging relationship and allocated to the category ‘‘at fair value through profit or loss’’ in
accordance with IFRS 9. STADA reports these financial liabilities in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item.
Here, those derivative financial instruments are also included which serve to hedge interest rate and
currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments, and which are also
measured at fair value in accordance with the regulations of IFRS 9 on hedge accounting. Unless market
prices are available, fair value is determined with measurement models based on discounted cash flow
models.

Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging
instruments are generally recognized in income statement items in which the hedged underlying
transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in addition to the fair value
change in the derivative, the opposing fair value change in the underlying transaction is recognized in
profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the hedged risk.

STADA has so far not made use of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as
financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated
Financial Statements is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, STADA
makes estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other
factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and
assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual
circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting
issues concerned are detailed below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

STADA carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain
assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Assets’’ to the carrying amounts of the respective cash-generating units and an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Costs’’ are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on the basis of individual
appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years based on approved budgets.

For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the
amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial
years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal developments and
developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined in the context of current

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment may differ
from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement
may be necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ credit-worthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income tax expenses in each tax
jurisdiction. In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the
expected income tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain
items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the
basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a
corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation
of the Group in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the STADA Group is
being allotted to a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services.
Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the
introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in
the form of a Group guideline.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the
biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific
mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The
discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed
interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds,
the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and
a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success of these methods. The

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due
to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

Sales at STADA primarily resulted from the supply of products and, to a much lesser extent, from license
revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please refer to the details included in the Accounting
Policies.

In financial year 2018, there was an increase in sales based primarily on strong sales development in the
Belgian, Italian, German and Serbian generics business as well as in the branded products business in the
United Kingdom and Germany. The French and Russian generics business as well as the Russian and
Italian branded products business had a negative effect. Exchange rate effects and portfolio changes as an
adjustment to the previous year’s figure had a total influence of A95.4 million on sales in the reporting year.
For information on how sales are broken down according to segments, please refer to ‘‘Segment reporting’’
in Note 44.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in k E** **2018** **2017**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 906,940 930,042

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A106.5 million (previous year: A106.9 million)
mainly included amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a necessary condition
for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with
reversals. The reversals amounted to A9.4 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A7.2 million).

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and the sales force, selling expenses also comprise the costs
for advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for
logistics that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called
discounts in kind—insofar as this is possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not
included. The resulting expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing expenses in the amount of A239.0 million (previous year: A220.7 million)
corresponded to a share of 44% in selling expenses (previous year: 43%). In addition, selling expenses
included depreciation in the amount of A7.4 million (previous year: A7.3 million).

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2018, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A6.1 million
(previous year: A6.5 million).

General and administrative expenses decreased in the reporting year by a total of A16.0 million. The
decrease primarily resulted from decreased consulting expenses in connection with various restructuring
processes in financial year 2017.

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details
included in the Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2018, research and development expenses increased by A4.8 million compared to the
previous year.

The research and development expenses included depreciation in the amount of A2.4 million (previous
year: A2.2 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A20.4 million (previous year:
A21.4 million) were capitalized in financial year 2018 (see the Notes on the item ‘‘Intangible Assets’’).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the f ollowing items:

**in k E** **2018** **2017**

Income from write-ups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,899 13,995

and amounted to A1.3 million for the Generics segment and A14.6 million for the Branded Products
segment. The write-ups relate for the most part to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks, the
scheduled amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

The remaining other income mainly includes income from the capital consolidation of BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG which is regarded as a special item in the financial year as well as other income that
cannot be directly allocated to the functional costs and which are made up of many immaterial individual
items in the Group companies.

**17. Other expenses (Continued)**

Other expenses include impairment losses in the amount of A42.2 million (previous year: A60.4 million)
that in the reporting year exclusively relate to impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill
in the reporting year as well as the largest single item attributable to Fultium� D3 vitamin drops, as was the
case in the previous year. The impairment losses relate for the most part to various pharmaceutical
approvals and trademarks, the scheduled amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

In other expenses, in the reporting year there are expenses from impairments on receivables in the amount
of A15.5 million (previous year: A44.9 million) which for the most part relate to impairments due to
payment defaults of customers in Russia.

Losses on the disposal of non-current assets decreased in the reporting year by A5.0 million and resulted in
the previous year for the most part from the following situation: For the subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a
contract was concluded on the sale of the shares held by STADA in this company as of December 31, 2019.
For STADA, this was associated with the loss of control in this company. The company will now be
consolidated as an associate in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the time of the sale. In
connection with the loss of control in this company, there was a loss in the total of A5.5 million. This
resulted in a positive effect from the reversal of the currency translation reserve in the amount of
A1.2 million.

In remaining other expenses, net currency translation expenses in the amount of A1.9 million (previous
year: A2.0 million), made up of currency translation income of A45.6 million (previous year: A32.3 million)
and currency translation expenses of A47.5 million (previous year: A34.3million) was recognized. This
development was based in particular on adverse developments in the significant currencies in the CIS
region.

Additionally, the item remaining other expenses included personell expenses in the amount of A5.8 million
(previous year: A20.8 million) which in the reporting year resulted mainly from severance payments to
former Executive Board members as well as expenses due to changes in management. The regular
personnel expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective specialist departments. Primarily, the
severance payments affected employees whose regular personnel costs were recorded under administrative
costs.

During the previous year, the item for remaining other expenses included consulting services in connection
with the 2017 takeover by Bain Capital and Cinven in the amount of A45.0 million, which were considered
a special item in the financial year. Other consulting expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective
specialist departments.

**18. Financial result**

The **result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2018 relates to the companies AELIA**
SAS, BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Dialogfarma LLC as well as Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS accounted
for using the equity method. BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG was consolidated as an associate until
September 30, 2018, following a successful increase in shareholdings, it has been consolidated as a
subsidiary since September 30, 2018.

**Investment income primarily relates to profit distributions from companies not included in the Consolidated**
Financial Statements.

Interest income for the financial year 2018 includes the compounding effect for the sale price contractually
agreed for December 31, 2019 for the shares held in Company STADA Vietnam J.V.

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2018 included a net interest expense from other

liabilities was approximately 3.43% p.a. (previous year: approximately 25.51% p.a.). The average interest
rate for current financial liabilities was 1.97% p.a. as of the balance sheet date (previous year: 1.78%
p.a.).For the Group, the weighted average interest rate for financial liabilities was approximately 2.97%
p.a. (previous year: approximately 1.79% p.a.).

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A2.6 million in financial
year 2018 (previous year: A1.5 million). A capitalization rate of 2.5% for intangible assets (previous year:

**19. Income tax expenses (Continued)**

Actual income tax expenses recognized in the income statement can be divided according to timing as
follows:

**in k E** **2018** **2017**

**Actual income tax expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **68,502** **61,603**

Tax income from previous periods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 150 564

Deferred taxes recognized in the income statement are made up of the following:

**in k E** **2018** **2017**

**Deferred taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** �36,160 �8,618

- from loss/interest carryforwards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �3,793 2,291

The effective income tax rate amounted to 9.4% for financial year 2018. The effective income tax rate in
the previous year was 35.9%. The nominal income tax rate amounted to 28.3% in financial year 2018 for
STADA Arzneimittel AG in Germany. This includes corporate tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the
solidarity surcharge in the amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 357%.
The nominal income tax rate of STADA Arzneimittel AG is thus unchanged as compared to the previous
year.

For temporary differences from undistributed earnings of subsidiaries in the amount of A22.4 million, no
deferred tax liabilities were established, because these profits will be reinvested for an indefinite period.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement
was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes. The
tax effects of the respective tax rates to be applied locally depending on their applicable national and legal
forms are reported in a separate reconciliation.

As in the previous year, tax effects from loss/interest carryforwards resulted for the most part from
unusable interest expenses due to the interest barrier rule that was newly-introduced in the United
Kingdom.

The tax effects from the deconsolidation resulted in the previous year from the change of control at
STADA Vietnam J.V. and the change of status associated with it.

The tax effect from the negative difference from IFRS 3 is attributable to the acquisition of control and the
associated change of status of BIOCEUTICALS AG.

**19. Income tax expenses (Continued)**

The tax expense of STADA Arzneimittel AG in the financial year was mainly influenced by the conclusion
of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with the shareholder Nidda Healthcare GmbH.
This resulted in a change in the tax status of STADA Arzneimittel AG, which has been included in the
single tax entity of Nidda BondCo GmbH with its tax results since 2018 and must pay corporate tax
exclusively for 20/17 of the compensation payment to be made to the outside shareholders. No tax
allocation agreement was concluded with Nidda Healthcare GmbH as the direct parent company and/or
Nidda BondCo GmbH as the indirect parent company. Income taxes are therefore reported in accordance
with the formal approach. Accordingly, all deferred taxes of the former German controlling company
STADA Arzneimittel AG were transferred to the new controlling company Nidda BondCo GmbH. Nidda
BondCo GmbH also has to pay corporation tax, solidarity surcharge and trade tax on the taxable income of
STADA Arzneimittel AG, while STADA Arzneimittel AG is responsible for the taxation of recurring
compensation payments.

Deferred tax liabilities reported by STADA resulted, among other things, from deferred taxes in the
context of purchase price allocations carried out under IFRS 3. The reduction in deferred tax liabilities
from intangible assets compared with the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization of
intangible assets with purchase price allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as from

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**19. Income tax expenses (Continued)**

impairments on such assets. The increase in loss carryforwards results in particular from the first-time
inclusion of BIOCEUTICALS AG as a subsidiary due to the change in status.

Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under
‘‘Tax loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the
reporting date on the December 31, 2018 reporting date amounted to A72.7 million in financial year 2018
(previous year: A25.7 million).

Tax effects from loss and interest carryforwards led in the financial year to an increase in the income tax
expense in the amount of A1.2 million (previous year: increase in expenses from taxes on profits of
A3.1 million). This development was primarily influenced by British tax law which, from April 1, 2017 for
the first time limits the deduction of operating expenses for interest (interest barrier) which led to an
interest carryforward for which no deferred tax assets were established.

The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to
their expiry date:

The average number of employees decreased in the reporting year by 5% to 10,247 (previous year: 10,832),
mainly due to the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as of November 30, 2017. As of the reporting
date, the number of employees of the STADA Group increased in 2018 by 2% to 10,416 (previous year:
10,176). This increase was mainly due to the consolidation of the German company NorBiTec GmbH in
the course of the majority takeover of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and the Hungarian STADA
Hungary LLC. In addition, the increase in the number of employees as of the reporting date was due to the
expansion of the marketing and sales division of the German subsidiary STADAPHARM GmbH and the
Spanish subsidiary Laboratorio STADA S.L.

Personnel expenses, which are included in the expenses of the individual functional areas according to
their functional relevance, increased in financial year 2018 to A359.3 million (previous year:
A387.5 million). The decrease resulted mainly from the decrease in the number of employees in Russia and
the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as of November 30, 2017.

1 On August 26, 2016, the STADA General Meeting resolved to eliminate restrictions on the transferability of registered shares
by means of a change to the Articles of Incorporation. The change to the Articles of Incorporation was entered in the
commercial register on December 9, 2016 and took effect on this date. Therefore, since that time, the authorization from
approved capital pursuant to Section 6 (1) of the Articles of Incorporation relates to registered shares with no transferability
restrictions.

While depreciation and amortization are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according
to their functional relevance, there is a presentation within other expenses for impairment losses.

The impairment of intangible assets concerns various drug approvals and trademarks, the scheduled
amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

There were no impairment losses in the financial year.

Depreciation and amortization decreased by 0.3% compared to the previous year. More information on
amortization, depreciation and impairment losses is included in the Notes on non-current assets.

Additions from business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3, which relate to the fair value calculated
in the context for the purchase price allocations, resulted in the reporting year from the acquisition of
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and NorBiTec GmbH.

The umbrella brand Hemofarm which was capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the
Hemofarm group is included in capitalized trademarks recognized as an intangible asset with an indefinite
useful life, because STADA intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2018, this umbrella
brand has a carrying amount of A39.0 million (previous year: A38.9 million). In the context of the
impairment test of December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 13.7% were used. There
was no necessity for impairment in the reporting year. In addition, the change compared to the previous
year figure of A0.1 million is attributable to different exchange rates.

Furthermore, in the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in 2013, the umbrella brand
Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as STADA
intends to continue to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2018, this has a carrying amount of
A8.8 million (previous year: A8.6 million). The change is a result of different exchange rates. In the context
of the impairment test of December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 14.3% were used.
There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

As part of the acquisition of Laboratorio Vannier, the umbrella brand Vannier was capitalized as an
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark as STADA intends to continue to use the
trademark. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2018, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount
rate of 17.8% were used. An impairment loss of A0.2 million was recognized for the reporting year. As at
December 31, 2018, the umbrella brand was completely written off and now has a carrying amount of
A0.0 million (previous year: A0.2 million).

**24. Intangible assets (Continued)**

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2018 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A2.6 million (previous year: A1.5 million). In financial year
2018, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
2.5% (previous year: 1.6%).

Development costs of A23.7 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A23.9 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life (generally 20 years). STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization as expenses in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year
2018, these development costs amounted to of A72.3 million (previous year: A67.5 million).

Amortization of intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is
recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an
amount of A88.0 million (previous year: A86.5 million).

In financial year 2018, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A42.0 million (previous year: A55.7 million). As in the previous year, no valuation allowances on goodwill
were recorded in the reporting year.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation
(see Note 5.).

In comparison with the previous year, there were changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill which were
for the most part exclusively currency related.

In the context of the regular impairment tests for capitalized goodwill of September 30, 2018, the
discounted cash flow method was used to determine anticipated cash inflows, applying the following
parameters defined for the individual cash-generating units according to segment:

**Growth rates**
**of the**
**research**
**According to segment, defined as** **phase 2018** **WACCs 2018**
**cash-generating unit** **in %** **in %**

Generics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.4% 11.7%
Branded Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.6% 12.3%

In the previous year, the applied parameters were as follows:

**Growth rates**
**of the**
**research**
**According to segment, defined as** **phase 2017** **WACCs 2017**
**cash-generating unit** **in %** **in %**

Generics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.3% 9.6%
Branded Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5% 10.0%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and medium-term market
developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth
rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year a
specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected long-term inflation rate was assumed for the
period after this three-year detailed planning horizon. The detailed planning phase for determining the
value in use are based on assumptions from past experience expanded to include current developments and
verified using external market data and analyses. The most important assumptions include the
development of future sales prices, amounts and costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment,
investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth rates. Significant changes to the above-described
assumptions would influence the determination of the value in use of the cash-generating units. The
discount rates applied are determined on the basis of external factors derived from the market and
adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the cash-generating units.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the different cash-generating
units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage
points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no
necessity for an impairment to any cash-generating unit.

Additions from business combinations refer to the companies BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG and
NorBiTec GmbH, which were included in the group of consolidated companies.

Property, plant and equipment included assets from finance leases, primarily relating to cars and trucks, in
the amount of A5.3 million (previous year: A4.4 million), which, in accordance with IAS 17, were recognized
at the present value of minimum lease payments and have since been subjected to scheduled depreciation.

As in the previous year, no borrowing costs were capitalized for property, plant and equipment in financial
year 2018.

**27. Investments measured at equity**

The disclosure as of the reporting date related to the accounting of shares in the associates STADA
Vietnam J.V. as well as Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS, AELIA SAS and Dialogfarma LLC using the equity
method.

Due to the purchase of additional shares and the associated acquisition of control, the former associate
BIOCEUTICALS Arznei-mittel AG was included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a subsidiary
since September 30, 2018.

Investments measured at equity developed as follows in financial year 2018 compared with the previous
year:

In financial year 2018, the decrease in investments accounted for at equity resulted mainly from the
exclusion of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG as an associate.

Interest rate effects related exclusively to STADA Vietnam J.V. because the equity carrying amount of
STADA Vietnam J.V. corresponds to the contractually agreed selling price for the sale on December 31,
2019 of the shares held by STADA under consideration of a relevant discounting effect.

**27. Investments measured at equity (Continued)**

Dividend distributions mainly included the dividends paid by STADA Vietnam J.V. for financial year 2018,
which represent partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of
2017 to sell the shares in this company held by STADA.

As of December 31, 2018, there were no trade accounts receivable due after one year (previous year:
A0.2 million).

Collateral exists for a portion of trade accounts receivable whose value was not impaired in the form of
bank or corporate guarantees as well as pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit
insurance for certain markets and customers. These are taken into account in the calculation of the default
risk.

The new regulations on the classification of financial assets lead to changes in the measurement and
disclosure of factoring-capable receivables on the basis of the present business model. These financial
assets, which continue to be included in trade accounts receivable, are no longer measured at amortized
cost but at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these receivables
are therefore recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. In this context, financial assets measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income are generally subject to the same impairment model as
financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Overall, valuation allowances on trade accounts receivable developed as follows:

For trade accounts receivable, an expected default on receivables is calculated over their terms on the basis
of a portfolio-specific default rate. The default rate indicates the probability that a debtor will default
within a period of one year. The default rates consider the industry risks and the economic environment of
the respective country. Each cluster is allocated to a different bandwidth of expected default rates.

**29. Return assets**

As of December 31, 2018, return assets due after a year amounted to A0.6 million. The return assets relate
to anticipated returns in connection with contracts with customers for which reutilization is expected.

The derivative financial assets included the positive market values of currency forwards (see Note 47.1.).

The remaining financial assets included receivables from the German factoring business in the amount of
A4.6 million and also comprise many insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

As of December 31, 2018, other financial assets included impairments in the amount of A9.7 million
(previous year: A11.4 million). The decline is based on payments received for financial assets that had been
written-down. There were no outstanding amounts for non-impaired other financial assets as in the
previous year.

Other assets comprised many insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

As of December 31, 2018, other assets included write-downs of A6.5 million. There were no impairments in
the previous year.

**32. Inventories**

Inventories can be divided as follows:

**in k E** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**

Materials and supplies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 108,541 91,638

In financial year 2018, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of
inventories in the amount of A35.7 million (previous year: A43.2 million), which were already deducted
from the amounts shown above through profit and loss. In financial year 2018, reversals here amounted to
A9.4 million (previous year: A7.2 million).

**33. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subject to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the respective
national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash equivalents
amount to A2.2 million (previous year: A2.7 million) and, as in the previous year, exclusively relate to cash
and cash equivalents in China.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents from A243.2 million as of December 31, 2017 to A343.8 million as
of December 31, 2018 resulted from the effects described as part of the explanations of the consolidated
cash flow statement. Further details on the development of cash and cash equivalents can be found in the
consolidated cash flow statement.

**34. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities**

As of December 31, 2018, in the STADA Group, an asset held for sale in the amount of A0.1 million
presented in a separate line item in the balance sheet.

In the previous year, assets held for sale in the amount of A1.8 million were presented as a separate line
item in the balance sheet. This included, among other things, a German subsidiary’s building that was held
for sale as well as an intangible asset from an Italian subsidiary held for sale.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**35. Equity**

Group equity amounted to A1,178.0 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: A1,006.4 million).
This corresponds to an equity ratio of 33.1% (previous year: 31.4%).

**35.1. Share capital**

As of December 31, 2018, share capital amounted to A162,090,344.00 (December 31, 2017:
A162,090,344.00) and was divided into 62,342,440 registered shares (December 31, 2017: 62,342,440), each
with an arithmetical share of share capital of A2.60 per share, and fully paid. Each share grants one vote in
the General Meeting.

As of December 31, 2018, Authorized Capital and Conditional Capital were comprised as follows:

**Amount in** E **Shares** **Purpose**

Authorized Capital . . . . 81,045,159.00 31,171,215 Increase of share capital (until June 5, 2023)

Conditional Capital
2013 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69,188,340.00 26,610,900 Settlement of options and/or convertible bonds,
conversion rights (until June 4, 2018) in
connection with issued bonds with warrants
and/or, participation rights and/or participating
bonds in the total nominal amount of up to
A1.0 billion, or in the scope of a guarantee
assumed for bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds, participation rights and/or
participating bonds issued by subordinate Group
companies

This authorisation expired on June 5, 2018 and
the Executive Board did not make use of it.

**35.2. Capital reserve**

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in
shareholders’ equity and particularly include the capital reserve of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Differences
from the capital reserve determined in accordance with the provisions of German commercial law
primarily result from the recognition at their market value of the shares of STADA Arzneimittel AG newly
issued in 2003 as well as the associated treatment of issuing costs, which were deducted from the capital
reserve.

Changes in the capital reserve were solely the result of the change in treasury shares in financial year 2018,
as was the case in the previous year.

**35.3. Retained earnings including net income**

Retained earnings including net income comprise net income for the financial year as well as earnings
generated in previous periods, provided these were not distributed or transferred under a profit transfer
agreement, including amounts transferred to retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of net debt from
defined benefit plans that were recognized through other comprehensive income are reported under this
item, taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, net income in the
amount of A0.7 million after deferred taxes—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling
interests—resulted from the remeasurement. It is mainly based on the increase in the discount rate for
various defined benefit plans in the STADA Group underlying the measurement of December 31, 2018 in
comparison with December 31, 2017. In addition, this position also includes currency translation
differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized in equity from performance-oriented pension
plans as well as the deferred taxes they incur which, in financial year 2018, amounted to expenses
recognized in equity of A0.03 million.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**35. Equity (Continued)**

In the 2018 financial year, retained income also significantly impacted by the increase in shares in the
Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco Joint Stock Company. In accordance with IFRS 10, the difference
between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the
consideration paid have to be recognised in equity and allocated to the owners of the parent.

**35.4. Other reserves**

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are reported in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve.

As part of the application of the new IFRS 9 standard since January 1, 2018, other reserves also include the
FVOCI reserve. Changes in the fair value of receivables measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income are recorded here with no effect on profit or loss.

The reduction of other reserves compared to the previous year primarily resulted from the depreciation of
the Russian ruble and the British pound sterling since December 31, 2017, which has led to expenses from
the currency translation of the companies that are accounted for in the Russian ruble and the pound
sterling.

**35.5. Treasury shares**

As of the balance sheet date, the Company held 84,273 treasury shares (previous year: 84,311), each with
an arithmetical par value of A2.60, which is equivalent to 0.14% (previous year: 0.14%) of the share capital.
In financial year 2018, 38 treasury shares were sold at an average price of A80.92 per share within the scope
of an employee stock option program.

**35.6. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares held by non-controlling interests related as of December 31, 2018 to the minority interests of other
shareholders in the subsidiaries BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm Banja Luka, Hemomont,
NorBiTec GmbH, Pymepharco, and STADA Pharmaceuticals (Beijing).

**36. Other non-current provisions**

Other non-current provisions made by STADA as of the reporting date in Germany and outside Germany
include pension provisions and other non-current provisions in the form of anniversary provisions and
provisions for working time accounts as follows:

**in k E** **Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**


Germany . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,397 15,305

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among other things, insurances, government bonds and securities funds.

In financial year 2018, the plan assets of one international subsidiary exceeded their pension obligations,
with the result that these assets in excess were reported under other assets as assets from overfunded
pension plans in the amount of A0.03 million (previous year: A0.02 million).

The past service cost in the reporting year amounts to income of A0.5 million and is largely attributable to
special events in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France. In the United Kingdom, the Supreme
Court in 2018 definitively confirmed a ruling that gender inequalities must be eliminated with respect to
guaranteed minimum pensions (GMPs) included in occupational pension plans. This resulted in past
service cost of A0.3 million. In Switzerland, the underlying group foundation has reduced the conversion
amounts from retirement capital to a lifelong annuities; this resulted in a gain of A0.4 million for the
STADA Group. In France, a plan curtailment led to an additional gain in the amount of of A0.4 million. In
addition, there were other special events with an insignificant impact on the balance sheet.

The fair value of plan assets underlying the pension obligations developed as follows for German group
companies:

Gains from plan assets amounted to A0.1 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: �A1.0 million) for
German Group companies and �A1.4 million for international Group companies (previous year:
A2.1 million).

The amount of the income of plan assets for German Group companies is mainly determined by an
increase of the plan assets of an approval to the level of the gross obligation as a result of existing
reinsurance; this decreased as a consequence of the slight increase in the actuarial interest rate in financial
year 2018 an has therefore had a decreasing effect on income. The reduction of the plan assets outside
Germany is mainly attributable to a negative performance of the plan assets in the United Kingdom and a
decrease in the income of the plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the amount of the plan
assets is calculated on the basis of an actuarial measurement and thus depends decisively on the
development of the actuarial interest rate. In financial year 2018, the actuarial interest rate increased; this
led to a reduction of the obligation as well as assets and consequently of income.

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan assets, are expected in the amount of A0.8 million for German Group companies
and A3.7 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the
company. For the STADA Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 84%. Accordingly, the following details
focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension
plans. Regulations and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit
plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan
participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In the calculation of
the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as a basis for
consideration of mortality and fluctuation.

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A41.6 million and were composed of
three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally.
Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff was
transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due
to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with
IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a
provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this
benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the
future.

Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that
the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands
is, in part, financed through insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned
requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement
or early death.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets
received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The
assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the
amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A25.6 million.

The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest
rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of
investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the

**36. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should
change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future
contributions received.

Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees
have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the
evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the
insurance, the company could be required to make an additional contribution payment. In the calculation
of the amount of the pension obligations and plan assets, the assumptions of the AG forecast table 2018
were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality. Company-specific age-related annual fluctuation
rates serve as a fluctuation assumption.

In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees with defined benefit plans that are concluded for
new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plan plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator. The pension plans are
monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for
fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the
technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and
participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the
discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional
contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to
expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

As of December 31, 2018, plan assets amounted to A21.4 million. All assets have quoted market prices on
an active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the
S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table
CMI 2015 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are
no longer relevant for the pension plan.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension
law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the
pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality
and fluctuation.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements
or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution
plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to
A26.9 million in financial year 2018 (previous year: A26.8 million).

The previous year’s values for current and non-current financial liabilities can be attributed to the fact that
the financing agreements include a right of return for investors for their respective bonds, promissory note
loans or bank loans in case of a change of control or a change of rating at STADA. In view of this, the
company had assumed in the previous year that quick repayment would be possible and had reclassified its
financial liabilities from non-current to current accordingly. After the exercise option expired and the
associated amounts called due were repaid early in the first quarter of 2018, the financial liabilities not
optioned were reclassified accordingly from current to current and non-current liabilities and thus the
financing agreements that were not retired early were assigned to their original maturities on the balance
sheet. STADA Arzneimittel AG and certain material subsidiaries (in accordance with the instructions
given by the majority shareholder Nidda Healthcare GmbH) have provided certain collateral to secure
capital market liabilities and other financial liabilities assumed by Nidda and its affiliated companies
(including STADA) or for which Nidda and its affiliated companies (including STADA) have provided
collateral. The provision of these collateral securities results in the holders of the bonds having the right to
redeem the nominal amount and accrued interest under STADA bonds. The bond is therefore classified as

Holding GmbH intended, among other things, to refinance the repayment of financial liabilities.

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure,
financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in
foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from
operating activities amounted to A320.3 million in the reporting year (previous year: A262.9 million). This
development was mainly due to a significant increase in gross cash flow as a result of a strong annual result
and lower income tax payments. In addition, there were significantly lower cash outflows in connection
with inventories and slight cash inflows in connection with trade accounts receivables compared with
significant cash outflows in the previous year. Additionally, significantly lower consumption from the
deferrals for healthcare insurance settlements was recorded. This was offset by significantly higher cash
outflows from the settlement of trade accounts payable, which were high at the end of the previous year.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from
disposals. This amounted to -A300.3 million in the reporting year (previous year: �A122.6 million).

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement (Continued)**

In financial year 2018, payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A280.3 million
(previous year: A70.2 million) were made, of which A255.4 million (previous year: A39.5 million) related to
significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio. Proceeds
from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A9.2 million (previous year: A5.7 million).

Cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by payments for investments in intangible
assets in financial year 2018, primarily relating to the acquisition of the rights to the medical dandruff
shampoo Nizoral� for the EMEA region and the reacquisition of the rights to the sunscreen Ladival�. In
the context of business combinations, there were net inflows from the acquisition of the majority interest in
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as the company’s cash and cash equivalents acquired at the time of
acquisition exceeded the purchase price.

Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies related to dividends of STADA
Vietnam J.V., which was accounted for using the equity method, which represent partial payments in
connection with the agreement concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell the shares in this company
held by STADA as of December 31, 2019.

Cash flow from financing activities amounted to A79.7 million in financial year 2018 (previous
year: �A227.8 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend
distribution payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. This
development was primarily attributable to significant increase in financial liabilities due to the loans
granted to STADA by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH. This was offset by higher repayments of financial
liabilities. This resulted in particular from the following material effects: Due to the takeover in 2017, the
creditors of STADA Arznei-mittel AG were entitled in accordance with the financing conditions to
prematurely terminate bonds, promissory note loans and bank loans. Among other things, a partial amount
of A360.2 million made due prematurely in the first quarter of 2018 in this context. In the second quarter of
2018, the scheduled repayment of a bond in the amount of A347.1 million was another material effect.

Dividend distribution payments of A6.8 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders
of STADA Arznei-mittel AG for financial year 2017.

Given the high level of expenditures for investments, free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating
activities and cash flow from investing activities amounted to A20.0 million in financial year 2018 (previous
year: A140.2 million).

Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

**44. Segment reporting**

The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting
methods used in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements. Services between the segments are charged
based on market prices.

Segmentation within the STADA Group is based on sales differentiation. Thus, the allocation to the
individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for
parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reallocated.

In accordance with the reporting structure the Group is managed by operating segment, i.e. in accordance
with the two segments Generics and Branded Products.

Generics are products for the health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or
several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning
complies with one of the two following criteria:

- The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another
supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient

or

- the product is an integral part of a marketing concept targeting more than one product and indication
for primarily prescription products with active ingredients whose commercial property rights have
expired,

or

- the product is sold under its international non-proprietary name (INN).

Branded products are products for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients
whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two
following criteria:

- The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products,

or

- the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly
sold under a product- specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products.

All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be directly allocated to the segments, as well as the
elimination of sales between segments are recognized under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and
consolidation.

Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not,
however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In
addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance
organization billings are included here. Reporting of the segment liabilities and non-current segment assets
is waived, as this is without relevance for Group monitoring and for Group reporting.

In the presentation of sales by location of the company, sales to third parties are shown in accordance with
the invoicing company’s registered office of the countries listed.

Disclosures on assets by country relate to parts of the non-current assets (intangible assets, property, plant
and equipment).

**44.4. Information on important customers**

In accordance with IFRS 8.34, a company must provide notification when sales revenues from business
activities with a single external customer or customer group amount to at least 10% of the company’s total
sales revenues. This applied to one customer in the reporting year. The sales revenues identified with this
customer amounted to A325.0 million (previous year: A313.3 million). The sales revenues generated were
attributable to the Generics segment and the Branded Products segment. The same information also
applied to the previous year.

**45. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations to third parties based on past events but which will not
become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not under
STADA’s control. As of the reporting date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are
therefore not accounted. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for which
however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the obligation
cannot be adequately estimated.

STADA has contingent liabilitiesin connection, among other things, with patent risks for certain active
pharmaceutical ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The resulting possible
obligations amounted to approximately A31.0 million (previous year: A11.6 million). Development as
compared to the previous year are based primarily on a changed estimate with regard to the volume of
impending resource outflows for patent risks in the amount of A21.7 million. Additionally, potential
obligations as a result of a ban on economic activities between Russia and Ukraine ceased to exist.

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is below
50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**46. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations which can be
broken down as follows:

**46. Other financial obligations (Continued)**

Liabilities from operating leases relate, among other things, to IT equipment and vehicles. In addition,
there are liabilities from long-term rental agreements for office buildings with an average contract term of
5 years.

The total of future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to A48.7 million as of the
end of the financial year (previous year: A54.9 million) and can be broken down according to remaining
term as follows:

In financial year 2018, lease payments in the amount of A34.6 million (previous year: A32.2 million) were
recognized as an expense.

Other financial obligations include long-term obligations for logistics services. Furthermore, contingent
liabilities in the amount of A28.3 million in Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom, as well as additional
guarantees assumed by the STADA Group are included in other financial liabilities, among other things.

Due to the change in status of BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG from a company accounted for using
the equity method to a fully consolidated subsidiary as of September 30, 2018, the guarantee of
A25.0 million to Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, which exists in connection with a supply contract
between Hospira and BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, is no longer included in other financial
obligations as of December 31, 2018 (previous year: A25.0 million).

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short residual terms, their
carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to their fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of
promissory note loans, bonds, as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the
current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the fair values for liabilities to
credit institutes.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables as well as of held-to-maturity financial investments with
residual terms of more than a year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade accounts payable as well as remaining financial

liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, STADA reviews the allocation to the
respective hierarchy levels according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If a
need for reclassification is determined, the re-classification is carried out as of the beginning of the
reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications between the respective hierarchy
levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (currency forwards, in the previous year interest rate
swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards are determined using
financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information service, such as
spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In the previous
year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties.

STADA designates currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/DKK, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD and EUR/GBP) as
fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company loans. The changes in
value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates,
are offset by the changes in value spot components of the currency forwards of the currency forwards. The
objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks
are not part of this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively
and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were
sufficiently effective.

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result. Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from currency swaps recognized at fair value through profit or loss, which are reported
under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the currency translation result, disclosure
of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other income or other expenses. Earnings from
the disposal of financial instruments relate to the fulfillment of currency swaps.

**47.3. Factoring**

**Factoring transactions with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks**

There are two revolving receivable selling agreements with banks and financial institutes (together
‘‘receivables buyers’’) with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks for two agreements without
a general purchase limit and for one agreement with a purchase limit of A17.5 million. The agreements
have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby STADA is free to decide if and in
what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk evaluation
with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late payment
risk). In return for a fixed program fee recognized in expenses at the time of derecognition, both risks are
fully transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The nominal volume of receivables sold by STADA but not
yet paid under the factoring agreements amounted to A38.0 million on the reporting date.

**Factoring transactions with distribution of essential opportunities and risks for which control of the**
**asset remains with STADA**

There are factoring agreements pursuant to which STADA, on a revolving basis, sells trade accounts
receivables up to a total general purchase limit of A135.6 million to banks and financial institutes. The
agreements have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby STADA is free to
decide if and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the
risk evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment
(late payment risk). The credit risk is partially transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The late payment
risk continues to be borne in its entirety by STADA. The maximum credit risk to be borne by STADA,
translated into euro, amounted to A1.3 million as of the reporting date. The other credit-risk related
defaults are assumed by the buyer. The late payment risk continues to be borne in its entirety by STADA.
The maximum risk of loss for STADA resulting from the credit risk and the late payment risk from the
receivables sold as of the reporting date, translated into euro, amounted to A1.4 million. The nominal
volume of receivables sold by STADA but not yet paid under the factoring agreements, translated into
euro, amounted to A51.7 million on the reporting date. The ongoing commitment of STADA as of
December 31, 2018, translated into euro, amounted to A1.4 million and the carrying amounts of the
associated liability, translated into euro, amounted to A1.4 million.

**48. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**

**48.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Executive Board in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all
transactions above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Executive Board must first be approved
by the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount
of current risks.

**48.2. Currency risks**

STADA’s Group and balance sheet currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, STADA is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

F-235

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**48. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

However, STADA is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency-related
risks through, in addition to natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to
hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In the reporting
year, STADA made use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and currency swaps. The maturity dates of
futures contracts is adjusted to the term of the underlying transaction. The residual term of the contracts is
currently up to one year.

In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations
lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the
conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency
than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally
negative and depreciation is generally positive.

STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In case of hedging transactions they are compared with the balances
of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding
foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the foreign
currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison with respective
functional currency are as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**

currency by 10% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +15,325 +1,576 +1,862 +2,178 �3,126 +1,968

In this regard, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items in Kazakhstani tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia relate to a balance
from international Group companies in euro and outstanding foreign currency reserves in Kazakhstani
tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia. The reported outstanding foreign currency positions in the US dollar relate
exclusively to foreign currency holdings in US dollars at German and international Group companies. The
risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective,
results from the functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall, based on
outstanding foreign currency items as of the reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the
respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would have

led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A3.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million) or in
the amount of earnings of A3.9 million (previous year: A2.2 million).

**48.3. Interest rate risks**

STADA is subject to interest risks from the investment of financial assets as well as financial debts,
primarily in the Euro zone.

In 2018, an average of 33% (previous year: 88%) of financial liabilities in euro had fixed interest rates.

In 2018, STADA did not enter into any interest rate hedging transactions.

STADA calculates existing interest rate risks using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors—if relevant—are generally included in the calculation:

- Changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that were
not hedged against interest rate risks

The interest-rate risk at STADA is of secondary importance.

**48.4. Default risks**

STADA is exposed to a default risk in its operating business if contracting parties fail to meet their
obligations. Alongside the implementation of appropriate credit management processes, such transactions
are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing to avoid default risks in
financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. STADA therefore strives to maintain
business relations only with partners of impeccable financial standing. In addition, STADA partly uses
suitable measures such as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard itself against
default risk. Past due receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored and potential default
risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that in a
difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments
to STADA or business partners of STADA and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks
arise.

STADA’s maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets
recognized. In addition, STADA granted guarantees, which amounted to a total nominal volume of
A29.0 million (previous year: A63.1 million) as of the reporting date (see Note 46.). STADA has various
forms of collateral for credit securities such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of
receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets
and customers.

**48.5. Liquidity risks**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of

F-237

**48. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of the STADA Group at all times by
maintaining a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves. STADA finances itself with short-term and long-term
borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, STADA also has solid
cash flow from operating activities.

**48.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

STADA counters currency risks with derivative financial instruments which are exclusively used to hedge
currency risks resulting from operating activities and financial transactions. Derivative financial
instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

The total volume of currency rate related derivatives is comprised as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2018** **Dec. 31, 2017**
**in k E** **Nominal value** **Fair Value** **Nominal value** **Fair Value**

**Derivatives without hedging relationship**

STADA designates currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/DKK, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD and EUR/GBP) as
fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company loans. The changes in
value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency exchange rates,
are offset by the changes in value of the spot component of the currency forwards. the currency forwards.
The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit
risks are not part of this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both
prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging
relationships were sufficiently effective. In the reporting period, new fair value hedges with a nominal
volume totaling A681.5 million were designated for reduction of the fair value risk (previous year period:
A161.5 million). At STADA, as of December 31, 2018, there were currency derivatives with a net fair value
of k A1,770 (December 31, 2017: k A�566) which were designated as hedging instruments within the scope
of fair value hedges. Losses recognized in currency translation result of k A4,088 (previous year: k A863)
resulted in financial year 2018 from the carrying amount adjustment of the underlying transaction, from
the changes in fair values of the spot components of the hedging transactions, profits of k A4,088 (previous
year: k A863) were recognized in currency translation result.

**48.7. Disclosures on capital management**

The objectives of the STADA capital management are the safeguarding of the business operation, the
creation of a solid equity base for financing profitable growth as well as guaranteeing attractive dividend
payments and the capital service. The STADA capital management consistently aims for the Group
companies to have an equity basis that corresponds to the local requirements. When implementing and
checking the Group’s capital and liquidity the legal requirements are taken into account.

An important key figure for capital management at STADA is the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio,
which amounted to 2.1 in financial year 2018 (previous year: 2.4).

In this connection, the net debt and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio were as follows:

The financing agreements stipulate a right of return for the bonds, promissory note loans or bank loans on
the part of the respective investors in the case of a change of control and a change to STADA’s rating.
Nidda Healthcare Holding AG (now Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH), as part of the takeover offer,
agreed to provide STADA with financing for the financing amounts for which an early repayment of the
STADA financing is upcoming. The loan of the shareholder amounts to A 929.6 million as of December 31,
2018 and is reported under non-current financial liabilities. In 2017, a loan in the amount of A40.0 million
was already granted by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH in this connection. This loan was included in the
calculation of net debt.

**51. Fees for the auditor (Continued)**

The fees for audits relate to payment for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the
Financial Statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG and its German subsidiaries at the end of the financial
year. For financial year 2017, they also include the review of the Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements of June 30, 2017.

Other services from PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH relate primarily to services within the scope of due
diligence processes.

**52. Corporate Governance**

Stock Corporation Act was last issued by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in December 2018.
The declaration is publicly available via the Company’s website (www.stada.com/de in German or
www.stada.com in English) and is also presented in the Annual Report.

**53. Events after the end of the financial year**

After the closing date, the following events with significant or possibly significant effects on the net assets,
financial position and results of operations of the STADA Group occurred:

- On December 20, 2018, STADA had announced that STADA and certain of its significant
subsidiaries—in accordance with the directive issued by Nidda Healthcare GmbH (Nidda)—have
granted certain in rem securities to secure capital market liabilities and other financial liabilities,
which were raised or guaranteed by Nidda and its affiliated companies and for which these securities
were accepted.[1] The grant of such in rem securities will give holders of the STADA A300,000,000
1.75% fixed rate bonds due 2022 the right to demand repayment of their principal and accrued
interest on such STADA bonds. On January 8, 2019, STADA published the relevant tender offer,
whose final expiration date is currently June 19, 2019.[2]

**54. Dividend**

In the reporting year, net profit of STADA Arzneimittel AG amounted to A0.00 and, due to the profit
transfer, corresponds to the annual result. In view of the domination and profit and loss transfer
agreement dated December 19, 2017, an amount of A134,189,487.01 will be transferred to Nidda
Healthcare GmbH. Pursuant to the existing domination and profit and loss transfer agreement DPLTA,
STADA Arzneimittel AG will no longer distribute dividends as of financial year 2018. Instead, Nidda
Healthcare GmbH has undertaken to pay to the external shareholders of STADA Arzneimittel AG a
compensation of A3.82 gross or A3.53 net under current taxation per STADA share for the duration of the
agreement and accordingly also for financial year 2018. The compensation payment is due on the third
banking day after the Annual General Meeting of STADA Arzneimittel AG for the financial year just
ended, but no later than eight months after the end of the financial year in question.

The following auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report (Konzernlagebericht) of STADA Arzneimittel AG as of and for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2018. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in
this offering memorandum.

**Independent Auditor’s Report**

To STADA Arzneimittel AG, Bad Vilbel

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE**
**GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT**

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG, Bad Vilbel, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2018, the
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated cash flow
statement and consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2018, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary
of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of STADA
Arznei-mittel AG, which is combined with the Company’s management report, for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2018. In accordance with the German legal requirements we have not audited
the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the ‘‘Other Information’’ section of
our auditor’s report.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
§ [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handels- gesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial
position of the Group as at December 31, 2018, and of its financial performance for the financial year
from January 1 to December 31, 2018,

and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report
does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the ‘‘Other
Information’’ section of our auditor’s report.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management
report.

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as ‘‘EU
Audit Regulation’’) in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW).
Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the ‘‘Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management
Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in
accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided
non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these
matters.

In our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:

1. Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets

2. Revenue recognition including expected revenue reductions

3. Accounting treatment of material acquisitions

Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:

1. Matter and issue

2. Audit approach and findings

3. Reference to further information

Hereinafter we present the key audit matters:

**1.** **Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets**

1. The ‘‘Intangible assets’’ balance sheet item reported in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements included EUR 389 million (11% of consolidated total assets) for ‘‘Goodwill’’ and
EUR 1,145 million (32% of consolidated total assets) for ‘‘Regulatory drug approvals, trademarks,
customer relationships, software, licenses and similar rights’’. While goodwill and other intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment (‘‘impairment test’’) on an annual
basis or if there are indications of impairment, such a test needs only to be carried out for intangible
assets with definite useful lives if there are indications of impairment (‘‘triggering events’’).

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the level of the group of cash-generating units to which the
relevant goodwill is allocated. In an impairment test, the carrying amount of the respective
cash-generating unit (including the affected goodwill) is compared against the higher of the value in
use and the fair value less costs of disposal. In a first step, the Company generally conducts the test
based on the value in use. For the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives, the relief from royalty
method is initially applied.

The Company has identified certain indicators, which are monitored and in case of negative
development trigger an impairment test for assets with definite useful lives. In the case of regulatory
drug approvals, however, an impairment test is carried out in each instance at the end of the financial
year. Brands and regulatory drug approvals are normally measured based on the present value of
future cash flows generated by the affected asset from marketing the respective products. An
impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount is less than the respective carrying amount.

Present value is calculated using discounted cash flow models. The starting point is the Group’s
financial plan, which is projected forward using growth assumptions. The discount rate used is the
weighted cost of capital for the relevant cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units.

The result of this measurement depends to a large extent on estimates made by the executive
directors’ with respect to future cash inflows and the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other
assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background, and due to
the complex nature of the measurement, this matter was of particular significance for our audit.

2. As part of our audit, we reviewed the methodological procedure adopted for the purpose of the
impairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted cost of capital, among other things. We
verified the appropriateness of the future cash inflows used in the measurement, including by
comparing these disclosures with the current budgets in the financial plan prepared by the executive
directors’ and approved by the supervisory board, and by reconciling them against general and sectorspecific market expectations. We also assessed whether the basis for including the costs of Group
functions was accurate. With the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate
applied can have a material impact on the recoverable amounts calculated in this way, we also focused

F-245


-----

our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated
the measurement model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we reproduced
the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company and carried out our own additional sensitivity
analyses with respect to those cash-generating units with low headroom (recoverable amount
compared with the carrying amount). Taking into account the information available, we determined
that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the allocated goodwill, were
adequately covered by the discounted future net cash inflows. Overall, the measurement inputs and
assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the
ranges considered by us to be reasonable.

3. The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and intangible assets are contained in notes 9 ‘‘Accounting
policies’’ and 24 ‘‘Intangible assets’’ to the consolidated financial statements.

**2.** **Revenue recognition including expected revenue reductions**

1. The EUR 2,330.8 million reported under ‘‘Sales’’ in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
relate primarily to the sale of products and provision of services. Since large-volume transactions are
involved, the company has established comprehensive processes and systems for recognizing and
deferring sales. Revenue is recognized when the goods have been delivered or the services rendered.
The transaction price is measured as the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services. Variable consideration is
considered when measuring the transaction price (discounts to health insurance organizations, other
health sector institutions and customers, as well as expected returns, among others). When
recognizing revenue, material assumptions have to be made with respect to discounts that must
subsequently be granted and returns that must subsequently be accepted, and the corresponding
revenue adjustments have to be recognized.

Particularly in Germany, discount arrangements with health insurance organizations are agreed for a
specific pharmaceutical ingredient by means of tenders over a specific period of time. The
corresponding drug is initially sold to patients at a binding sales price, which is then subject to a
discount subsequently granted to the respective health insurance organization.

The revenue adjustments are based to a large degree on the executive directors’ estimates and
assumptions and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainties. Against this background and due
to the underlying complexity of the measurement on which this significant item in terms of its amount
was based, this matter was of particular significance for our audit.

2. Our audit included assessing the appropriateness and effectiveness of the processes and controls
within the Company’s internal control system established to realize revenue and make revenue
adjustments, including the IT systems used. To this end, we also involved our specialists from Risk
Assurance Services (RAS). With the knowledge that the complexity of the accounting treatment and
the estimates and assumptions to be made give rise to an increased risk of accounting misstatements,
we assessed the appropriateness of the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to
revenue adjustments. At the same time, we verified and assessed the methodology applied by the
executive directors to make revenue adjustments. We also used the detailed information obtained to
assess the relevant assumptions made by the executive directors as of the balance sheet date. In
addition, we verified the consistency of the methods used by the Company to recognize revenue and
make revenue adjustments. We also compared the revenue adjustments with contract documents.

In doing so, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates applied and the assumptions made by
the executive directors concerning the recognition and measurement of revenue were sufficiently
documented and that the estimates applied and the assumptions made by the executive directors were
consistently derived.

3. The Company’s disclosures relating to revenue recognition are contained in notes 9 ‘‘Accounting
policies’’ and 11 ‘‘Sales’’ to the consolidated financial statements.

**3.** **Accounting treatment of material acquisitions**

1. In the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018, the Nizoral and Ladival
trademarks are recognized at amortized cost of EUR 190.3 million under the ‘‘Intangible assets’’
balance sheet line item as material additions (EUR 195.6 million) during the reporting period. In

F-246


-----

addition, control over the Bioceuticals Group was acquired as of September 30, 2018, due to the
acquisition of a further 35.5% interest to total 51.3% of the shares of Bioceuticals Arzneimittel AG.

STADA Arzneimittel AG acquired the trademark to Nizoral as of June 21, 2018, and the trademark to
Ladival as of June 17, 2018, for a total of EUR 195.6 million. The agreements are accounted for as an
asset acquisition, whereby the acquired trademarks are carried at cost and amortized. In addition, the
acquisition of control over the Bioceuticals Group was accounted for as a business combination by
recognizing the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. Taking into consideration the purchase
price of EUR 35.0 million for the additional interest, the remeasurement of previously held interests
as required under IFRS 3, and the EUR 78.3 million share of the net assets acquired attributable to
STADA AG, this results in a bargain purchase of EUR 27.6 million recognized in profit or loss. In
view of the complexity of identifying and measuring the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the
business combination and the material cumulative impact of the acquisitions on the assets, liabilities,
financial position and financial performance of the STADA Group, these were of particular
significance in the context of our audit.

2. In auditing the accounting treatment of the acquisitions of intangible assets and shares, we began by
inspecting and assessing the agreements. Among other things, we agreed the purchase prices paid by
STADA Arzneimittel AG as consideration for the acquired assets and shares to the supporting
documentation for the payments made, as provided to us. The recognition and measurement of the
acquisitions was assessed in particular on the basis of the criteria for an asset acquisition or a business
combination. We examined whether the acquisitions of the Nizoral and Ladival trademarks were
properly accounted for as asset acquisitions and whether the acquisition of control over the
Bioceuticals Group was properly accounted for as a business combination. For the business
combination, we assessed the underlying opening balance sheets. A valuation report was available to
us for the purchase price allocation performed pursuant to IFRS 3, and we assessed this report
accordingly. Given the specific measurement characteristics, we were assisted by our internal
valuation specialists. Among other things, they assessed the appropriateness of the methods on which
the measurements were based as well as the measurement parameters used. We assessed fair values
that were measured centrally (e.g., of customer relationships) by reconciling quantity structure with
the original financial accounting records and the parameters used. We also used checklists to establish
whether the requirements set out in IFRS 3 for disclosures in the notes to the financial statements had
been complied with in full. We checked that the EUR 27.6 million bargain purchase was recognized
under ‘‘Other income’’ in the consolidated income statement.

On the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the recognition in the
financial statements of the acquisitions of intangible assets and the business combination under
consideration of the assumptions and measurement parameters underlying the measurement is
appropriate overall.

3. The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and intangible assets are contained in notes 8 ‘‘Business
Combinations’’, 9 ‘‘Accounting policies’’ and 24 ‘‘Intangible assets’’ to the consolidated financial
statements.

**Other Information**

The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
following non-audited parts of the group management report:

- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB included in section
‘‘Corporate Governance Report including Statement on Corporate Governance’’ of the group
management report

- the corporate governance report pursuant to No. 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code

- the separate non-financial report pursuant to § 289b Abs. 3 HGB and § 315b Abs. 3 HGB

The other information comprises further the remaining parts of the annual report—excluding crossreferences to external information—with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements,
the audited group management report and our auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

F-247


-----

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit,

or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements and the Group Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position,
and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such
internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer
(IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group
management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is

F-248


-----

higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements,
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant
independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

**OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**

**Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation**

We were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on June 6, 2018. We were engaged by the

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**General Information**

**1. Corporate information**

STADA Arzneimittel Aktiengesellschaft (STADA Arzneimittel AG) as the parent company of the STADA
Group (hereafter referred to as ‘‘STADA’’), located at Stadastrasse 2-18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is an
internationally-oriented company based in Germany and active throughout the world in the health care
and pharmaceuticals markets, especially in the Generics and Branded Products segments.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2017 were approved
for publication by the Executive Board on March 6, 2018.

**2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements**

The Consolidated Financial Statements prepared for STADA Arzneimittel AG as parent company as of
December 31, 2017, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Standards Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union
(EU), as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the
German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies
included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which
expenses incurred in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive
income, use was made of the option to present this separately from the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheet classification distinguishes between non-current and current assets and liabilities, some
of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or non-current distinction.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the
notes are shown in euro thousands (A k). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not
significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

In financial year 2017, STADA observed and, if relevant, applied the pronouncements and amendments to
pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which were first applicable as of
January 1, 2017. The changes had no or no significant effect on the presentation of STADA’s net assets,
financial position and results of operations.

**The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB:**

In July 2014, IASB published the standard IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. The standard replaces IAS 39
and introduces new rules for the classification, recognition and valuation of financial instruments.
Furthermore, IFRS 9 also includes guidelines on the accounting of hedging transactions. IFRS 9 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. STADA will apply the new standard for
the first time as of January 1, 2018, pursuant to the transitional regulations of IFRS 9, an adjustment of
prior-year figures is waived. Accordingly, the cumulative effect from initial application of IFRS 9 as of
January 1, 2018 will be recognized in equity with no effect on profit or loss. This will likely result in the
following impacts for the Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA:

The new regulations for the classification of financial assets will lead to changes for the receivables that can
be factored in terms of their measurement and presentation as a result of the underlying business model.
In the future, these will no longer be measured at amortized cost, but rather at fair value through profit or
loss. Changes in the fair value of these receivables will in future be recognized directly in equity. Within the
scope of the initial application as of January 1, 2018, this will result in no material effects.

Due to the new regulations on impairment, expected losses will in future be recognized as expenses earlier.
In this context, STADA will apply the simplified approach for trade receivables as well as contract assets.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations (Continued)**

As a result of the initial application of the impairment regulations in accordance with IFRS 9, as of
January 1, 2018, the volume of impairments, on the basis of an analysis that is still to be finalized, will likely
increase to somewhere in the magnitude of between A 6 million and A 9 million.

In May 2014, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 15 ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’.
IFRS 15 governs revenue recognition for contracts with customers in a 5-step model and in particular
replaces the existing standards IAS 11 ‘‘Construction Contracts’’ and IAS 18 ‘‘Revenue’’. IFRS 15 is to be
applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. STADA
will apply the new standard for the first time as of January 1, 2018. In this context, STADA will exercise its
right to choose the simplified initial application. Accordingly, the contracts that were not fully completed
as of January 1, 2018 will be accounted for as if the new standard IFRS 15 were already applied when these
contracts began so that the cumulative effect from the change will be recognized directly in equity. There is
no adjustment of the comparable figures from the prior-year period.

In accordance with the preliminary analysis, from the initial application of IFRS 15 there is an increased
cumulative effect in the likely amount of A 0.4 million to be recognized in retained earnings. The effect
resulted primarily from the to be accounted contractual assets which in future are to be shown within the
scope of return regulations and the deferred taxes to be established as a result. Furthermore, there will be
reclassifications as result of down payments received from the trade payables and payments in the
contractual liabilities in the likely amount of A 0.6 million. The new standard on revenue recognition will
thus have little impact on sales accounting, as sales are largely realized in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as a result of routine transactions. There are no agreements in the Group which regulate
multiple services within one contract or within several contracts (multi-element arrangements). There will
be no changes in the accounting of licensing agreements, which amounted to less than 2% of the total sales
revenue in financial year 2017. All of STADA’s license agreements are either bound to the achieved sales
of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of STADA that would allow the use of the
right by the licensee. If this were not the case for such license agreements, the result, due to the new
IFRS 15 standard, future sales would be realized in the amount of the entire license fee with the granting
of a license and therefore no longer, as they are presently, divided over the term of the license.

In January 2016, the IASB published the new IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’ standard, which determines the
recognition of contractual rights (assets) and obligations (financial liabilities) associated with leases in the
balance sheet for lessees. Lessees must therefore no longer classify leases as finance leases or operating
leases. IFRS 16 is to be applied for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier
application is permitted. STADA will apply the new standard for the first time from January 1, 2019 and
thereby likely modified retroactively, i.e. an adjustment of the prior-year figures will be waived. In this
context, the rights of use will likely be equated with lease liabilities at the time of the change.

An examination of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Consolidated Financial Statements has
not yet been fully completed. As a result of the accounting of assets and liabilities in the lessee’s balance
sheet, as required by IFRS 16, a significant increase in the balance sheet total is expected at the point of
initial application. In accordance with the currently existing leasing agreements and the currently available
investigation results, STADA expects an accounting of use of rights in the amount of approximately
A 40 million as well as recognition of leasing obligations in the amount of A 40 million. Instead of leasing
expenses, as a result of amendments to IFRS 16, future depreciation and amortization and interest
expenses will be recorded in the income statement—with a corresponding positive impact on the EBITDA.
STADA, pursuant to the current status of the investigation, assumes that the depreciation of the currently
existing leasing agreements will in future amount to approximately A 40 million. In addition, STADA
expects future interest expenses in the amount of approximately A 10 million. In accordance with the
previous requirements of IAS 17 ‘‘Leases’’, these expenses would have been fully recognized in operating
profit as a leasing expense and as a reduction of EBITDA. The changeover effect relates at STADA for the
most part to leased real estate, company vehicles as well as office and business equipment.

Furthermore, in May 2017, IFRIC 23 ‘‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’’ was issued by the IASB,
through which a clarification of the requirements of the approach and measurement of uncertain earnings
positions arose. According to this, a company within the scope of the assessment of the uncertainty must
estimate how probable the acceptance of the tax treatment of business transactions in the respective tax

jurisdictions is. The interpretation is to be applied for financial years which begin on or after January 1,
2019, whereby earlier application is permitted. STADA currently finds itself in the evaluation on the
impact of IFRIC 23 on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are
expected from the future application of the further standards and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

There were no changes to accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of
STADA’s net assets, financial position and results of operations or cash flow in financial year 2017.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Subsidiaries are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by STADA and are
therefore fully consolidated. Control exists if STADA Arzneimittel AG or its subsidiaries are in control of
an investee, are exposed to variable backflows and, due to control over existing rights, are able to
substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually substantiated by a share of
voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as
either joint operations or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control
possess the rights to assets and liabilities included in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties
involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures are to be included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which STADA can have significant influence and are not subsidiaries or
joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the
business, financial and earnings situation of the STADA Group is insignificant, are not consolidated or
accounted for using the equity method. Investments in these companies are accounted for either at fair
value or at amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales and balance sheet total of these
companies make up about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates included in financial year 2017 and are as follows:

As of January 1, 2017, the subsidiary STADA Pharmaceuticals Australia, Sydney, based in Australia, was
included in the scope of consolidation.

Furthermore, the acquisition of Serbian Velexfarm d.o.o., Belgrade, was completed in accordance with
corporate law in the first quarter of 2017. The company was consolidated as a subsidiary for the first time
on January 1, 2017.

STADA Import/Export International Ltd., Hong Kong, China, was also sold in the first quarter of 2017.
The transaction was completed on March 29, 2017. The assets and liabilities of the company were reported
as non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and associated liabilities as of December 31, 2016.
A gain of A 0.2 million was recorded with the deconsolidation of the company as of March 31, 2017.

**5. Scope of consolidation (Continued)**

Furthermore, on June 30, 2017, the legal merger of the German branded products companies
STADA GmbH and STADAvita GmbH, subsequently trading as STADA GmbH, was completed as was the
merger of STADApharm GmbH and cell pharm Gesellschaft f¨ur pharmaceutische und diagnostische
Pr¨aparate mbH, subsequently trading as STADAPHARM GmbH.

In the second quarter of the reporting year, there was an increase in the shareholding to 100% of the
shares in the Thailand-based STADA subsidiary STADA (Thailand) Company Ltd.

In addition, as of July 19, 2017, the legal merger of the two Russian companies OOO STADA
PharmDevelopment and OOO STADA CIS into OOO STADA Marketing and the continuation of the
company name OOO STADA Marketing.

In October 2017, there was also a legal dissolution of the Dutch subsidiary HTP Huisapotheek B.V.

In the Consolidated Financial Statements of the STADA Group, 79 companies were consolidated as
subsidiaries and five companies as associates as of the reporting date on December 31, 2017.

Unchanged from the previous year, BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG is included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements as an associate in accordance with the equity method. STADA holds 15.86% of the
shares in this company. The significant influence is therefore not directly due to the amount of shares held,
but instead is a result of STADA’s representation in the supervisory body of BIOCEUTICALS as well as
distribution rights granted for Epo-zeta in Germany through STADAPHARM GmbH and the associated
significant business transactions.

In addition, as was the case in the previous year, the two French companies Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and
AELIA SAS as well as the Russian Dialogfarma LLC were recognized as associates in accordance with the
equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the former Vietnamese subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was signed in the fourth quarter of
2017 for the sale of the shares held by in the company as of December 31, 2019. For STADA, this was
associated with the loss of control in this company. The company will now be consolidated as an associate
in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the time of the sale.

STADA CEE GmbH, STADAPHARM GmbH, STADA Pharma International GmbH and Mobilat
Produktions GmbH.

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full—
irrespective of the amount of the shareholding—as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the
historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate newly measured net assets of the
acquiree, STADA recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of the premises
underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the
period of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a
revaluation through profit or loss of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares
of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized
through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, as it is a transaction between the equity
investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to
the end of control by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between
the companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value
adjustments and provisions are released. If these consolidation measures result in deviations between the
IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities, deferred tax liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when
joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and
carried forward from this date in the amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A
positive difference determined during the purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill in the
carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the
period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates is
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IAS 39 that the carrying amount determined using the equity
method might be impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the
amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the shares in an
associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of STADA Arzneimittel AG is the euro and represents the reporting currency of
the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at
the time of the transactions. On every balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing
rate and non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate. Resulting currency translation
differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

F-267


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**7. Currency translation (Continued)**

The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate
method. Assets and liabilities are generally translated using the closing rate, while individual components
of equity are translated using the historical rates at their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s
perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated—and thereby also the
resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity—using the average exchange rate of the
period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in
equity in the ‘‘Provisions for currency translation’’. These provisions are released and recognized in income
if Group companies leave the scope of consolidation.

The exchange rate development of currencies important to STADA to the euro can be seen in the
following chart:

**8. Business combinations**

In financial year 2017, the following significant business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 occurred, for
which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in more detail below.

The Serbian subsidiary of STADA Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm A.D., acquired Serbian pharmaceutical
wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o., based in Belgrade, Serbia, to strengthen the business activities on the Serbian
market. The acquisition was completed with the aim of vertical integration in the Serbian market. The
purchase price for the acquisition will total a maximum of A 1.0 million and will be or has already been fully
paid in cash. The purchase was completed on January 6, 2017 after the competition authorities approved
the purchase contract signed in October 2016.

The provisional purchase price allocation from this merger resulted in goodwill of A 0.1 million, which was
attributable to the following:

Fair values were determined on the basis of observable market prices. To the extent that market prices
could not be determined, income or cost-oriented procedures were used for the evaluation of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed.

The gross value of the trade receivables is A 10.2 million. A 0.1 million was deemed not recoverable. Trade
accounts receivable were recorded at their fair value in the amount of A 10.1 million.

Sales generated with Velexfarm amounted to around A 61.9 million in financial year 2017. The operating
profit of this business combination adjusted for the effects of the purchase price allocation (around
A 0.7 million) amounted to around A 0.1 million in the reporting year.

Business relationships with Serbian Hemofarm A.D. had already existed before the acquisition. In financial
year 2016, these sales amounted to A 8.9 million.

**9. Accounting policies**

STADA’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these
are the accounting requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and which are described in more detail below insofar as they are significant for the
Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA or for which option rights are exercised.

**Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered. This is on condition that it is**
reasonably probable that measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that the substantial risks
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. It must also be possible to reliably measure
the Company’s own costs incurred or to be incurred.

Sales are recognized before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions (rebates or discounts) at fair
value of the consideration received or receivable. Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are
deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates are based on experience regarding
amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a
percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on
sales based on the respective contract in force.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses
related to accruals for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are
realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial**
goods sold or given free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income
is realized. In addition, cost of sales also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods
(e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead costs (e.g. scheduled depreciation of production

equipment and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value adjustments of excess or obsolete
inventories.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical**
discoveries in production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process at STADA is to obtain national or multinational
regulatory drug approval. Downstream from the development process is an evaluation process at the end
of which a decision on the actual execution of a development is made. Within the development process
itself, development costs relative to approvals for new drugs obtained by STADA result in capitalization as
intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to
become available for use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use
(i.e. usually to market it oneself) or sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

STADA immediately recognizes development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense in the periods
in which they are incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products
marketed.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least**
once per year (impairment-only approach). For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
aggregated into operating segments, where a cash-generating unit corresponds to a market region within
the two operating segments of the STADA Group for the purpose of an impairment test of goodwill.

STADA carries out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also
take place if indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount
of each cash-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a
cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the
valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable amount is
generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in use of the
cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an
individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. For the
period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of
50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions made in order to determine
the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the
discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually
according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally
determined assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a**
straight-line basis over the period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available
for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner.
The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses, dossiers with data for drug approvals or
in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar rights is between three
and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications
that these assets are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses
are recognized according to the difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an
impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized
cost.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment
tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of

these assets are compared with their carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.
For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty
method. At STADA, this affects the umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in the context of the acquisition
of the Hemofarm group, the umbrella brand Pymepharco capitalized in the context of achieving control
over Pymepharco, and the umbrella brand Vannier capitalized in the context of the acquisition of
Laboratorio Vannier. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives
at the level of the individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the level of the individual
companies that generate sales under the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible assets that are not yet
available for use are also generally put through annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting
period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life
continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized
development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of
individuals working in development, material costs, external services and directly allocable overhead costs.
Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally
20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus**
write-ups. Depreciation shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization
requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company and that the cost of the asset can be
reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant replacement
investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line
method. The depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the
case of technical facilities and three to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The
component approach, according to which every significant component of property, plant and equipment
with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied at STADA due to a lack of
relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are
reversed if the reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing
costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions are made in a currency other than the respective functional
currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact on the recording of original historical
costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable**
amount of an asset is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, STADA assesses whether
indications for impairment are apparent. If this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are
exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated with a discounted
cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows of intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for two operating segments with specific
parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under ‘‘Other expenses’’.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
cash-generating units within the STADA Group are defined at the level of individual assets within the
reportable segments of Branded Products and Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a
maximum of the carrying amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under
the item ‘‘Other income’’.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods),**
that are in the process of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the
production process or in the rendering of services (materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at

F-271

**9. Accounting policies (Continued)**

the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of sales are determined based on
weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production and
overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on
production facilities. Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the
period in which they occur. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be broken down into the following categories in accordance with IAS 39: loans and**
receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and
held-to-maturity investments. Financial assets are accounted for and measured pursuant to IAS 39.
Accordingly, financial assets are, as a rule, initially recognized at fair value. In addition, for all financial
assets which are subsequently measured at amortized costs, transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition are to be taken into account. Different measurement policies apply for subsequent
measurement in accordance with the applicable categories for financial assets pursuant to IAS 39. Cash
transactions with financial assets are accounted for as of the settlement date.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate**
method. Impairments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments
for specific defaults and expected default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the
expected default risk, STADA determines the expected future cash flows from receivables grouped by
debtor. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience relating to derecognition of
receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment conditions are
taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to
be taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces
the assets’ carrying amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under ‘‘Other expenses’’. Bad debts are derecognized against the
impairment account. Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of
expenses.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly**
attributable to the acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair
value, any transaction costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to
the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative market values that are not part of an
effective hedging relationship and allocated to the category ‘‘at fair value through profit or loss’’ in
accordance with IAS 39. STADA reports these financial liabilities in the ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ item.
Here, those derivative financial instruments are also included which serve to hedge interest rate and
currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments, and which are also
measured at fair value in accordance with the regulations of IAS 39 on hedge accounting. Unless market
prices are available, fair value is determined with measurement models based on discounted cash flow
models.

Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging
instruments are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the hedged underlying
transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in addition to the fair value
change in the derivative, the opposing fair value change in the underlying transaction is recognized in
profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the hedged risk.

STADA has so far not made use of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as
financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated
Financial Statements is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, STADA
makes estimates and assumptions relating to the future that are based on past experience as well as other
factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular circumstances. Although the estimates and
assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ from actual

F-272

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting
issues concerned are detailed below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the
acquired net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of
the previously held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation
methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

STADA carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future
cash flows of the cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain
assumptions, are to be determined for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Assets’’ to the carrying amounts of the respective cash-generating units and an allocation from ‘‘Corporate
Costs’’ are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on the basis of individual
appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years based on approved budgets. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific
estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The budget
values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to unforeseeable future legal
developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined in the
context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of
impairment may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an
impairment requirement may be necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated
amortization or depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of
management. If the actual useful life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or
amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the determination of impairment losses on fixed assets,
estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments are also made. Particularly in the
context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments, the growth
rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests
of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of
IAS 38 are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are
by their nature subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

STADA makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to
insolvency of customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to
bad debts as well as the customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual
derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial
position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the value of
receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

STADA operates in various countries and is obliged to pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction.
In order to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income
tax as well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to
IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are each to be determined on the basis of
assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has a corresponding
effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group
in the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the STADA Group is being allotted to
a comprehensive tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of
non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of
corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in the form of a
Group guideline.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles (Continued)**

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price
in an active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are
applied. The cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using
so-called ‘‘forward rates’’, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by
means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This
procedure is based upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and
future salary and pension increases. Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount
of future pension costs. For German Group companies, pension obligations are calculated based on the
biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables. Outside Germany, country-specific
mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The
discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed
interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds,
the discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and
amount of an outflow of resources. STADA creates provisions if there is a present external obligation and
a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on how STADA estimates the prospects of success of these methods. The
determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due
to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against
income. Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual
expenses for returns may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or
lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g. discounts to health insurance
organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a
reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of
probable sales.

**Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement**

**11. Sales**

Sales at STADA primarily resulted from the supply of products and, to a much lesser extent, from license
revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please refer to the details included in Accounting
Policies.

In financial year 2017, there was an increase in sales based primarily on strong sales development in the
Belgian, Italian and Serbian generics business as well as in the Russian branded products business.
Exchange rate effects and portfolio changes had a total influence of A 58.6 million on sales in the reporting
year. For information on how sales are broken down according to segments, please refer to the ‘‘Segment
reporting’’ in Note 42.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

**in E k** **2017** **2016**

Material expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 930,042 883,480
Impairment, depreciation and amortization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 106,900 100,976
Expenses from inventory write-downs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43,215 28,207
Remaining cost of sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 97,837 92,650

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,177,994** **1,105,313**

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of A 106.9 million (previous year:
A 101.0 million) mainly included amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a
necessary condition for the marketing of the products manufactured—in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with
reversals. The reversals amounted to A 7.2 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 7.7 million).

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**13. Selling expenses**

Selling expenses comprise in addition to the costs for sales departments and sales force also the costs for
advertising and marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics
that occur for completed final products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts
in kind—if possible under the legal regulations in a national market—are not included. The resulting
expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing expenses in the amount of A 220.7 million (previous year: A 210.4 million)
corresponded to a share of 43% in selling expenses (previous year: 43%). In addition, selling expenses
included depreciation in the amount of A 7.3 million (previous year: A 6.9 million).

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and
administrative expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2017, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of A 6.5 million
(previous year: A 7.0 million).

General and administrative expenses increased in the reporting year by a total of A 17.0 million. The
increase primarily resulted from increased consulting expenses in connection with various restructuring
processes.

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details
included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2017, research and development expenses increased by A 2.4 million compared to the
previous year.

The research and development expenses included depreciation in the amount of A 2.2 million (previous
year: A 2.3 million). Development costs for new products in the amount of A 21.5 million (previous year:
A 28.4 million) were capitalized in financial year 2017 (see the Notes on the item ‘‘Intangible Assets’’).

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

**in E k** **2017** **2016**

Income from write-ups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,995 3
Income from the reversal of impairments on receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,234 —
Income from the disposal of non-current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,026 —
Remaining other income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18,010 19,276

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **41,265** **19,279**

Income from write-ups in financial year 2017 is made up of many individual items in the Group companies
and related to the Generics segment with A 8.5 million and the Branded Products segment with
A 5.5 million. The write-ups relate for the most part to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks,
the scheduled amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

In the previous year, income from the reversal of impairments on receivables as well as income from
disposal of non-current assets were presented net of the relevant position within other expenses, whereas
in the reporting year a gross presentation of the positions mentioned was undertaken.

Income from disposal of non-current assets includes an amount of A 0.2 million which results from the sale
of the subsidiary STADA Import/Export International Ltd. carried out in the first quarter of 2017. This
resulted in a positive effect from the reversal of the currency translation reserve in the amount of
A 0.2 million.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**16. Other income (Continued)**

The remaining other income includes, among other things, income from a settled compensation agreement
reached as part of a legal dispute in Spain in the Generics segment as well as other income that cannot be
directly allocated to the functional costs and which are made up of many immaterial individual items in the
Group companies.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

**in E k** **2017** **2016**

Expenses from valuation allowances on accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44,913 5,972
Currency translation expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,966 9,379
Impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60,356 65,480
Impairment losses on goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — —
Losses from the disposal of non-current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,157 1,438
Remaining other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 88,868 56,664

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **203,260** **138,933**

Other expenses include impairment losses in the amount of A 60.4 million (previous year: A 65.5 million)
that exclusively relate to impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill in the reporting year
as well as the largest single position Fultium� D3 vitamin drops. In the previous year, impairment losses
were primarily due to reorganization decisions in connection with the adapted corporate strategy. The
impairment losses relate for the most part to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks, the
scheduled amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

The item also included net currency translation expenses in the amount of A 2.0 million in the reporting
year (previous year: A 9.4 million), made up of currency translation income of A 32.3 million (previous year:
A 59.5 million) and currency translation expenses of A 34.3 million (previous year: A 68.9 million). This
development was based in particular on opposing developments in the significant currencies in the regions
CIS, whereas these currencies recorded a strong downward movement in the comparable period.

In other expenses, in the reporting year there are expenses from impairments on receivables in the amount
of A 44.9 million (previous year: A 6.0 million) which for the most part relate to impairments due to
payment defaults of a customer in Russia. In the previous year, this position was netted of income from the
reversal of impairments on receivables, whereas in the current reporting period a gross presentation in
other income as well as other expenses was undertaken.

Losses on the disposal of non-current assets resulted for the most part from the following situation: for the
subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was concluded on the sale of the shares held by STADA in this
company as of December 31, 2019. For STADA, this was associated with the loss of control in this
company. The company will now be consolidated as an associate in the Consolidated Financial Statements
until the time of the sale. In connection with the loss of control in this company, there was a loss in the
total of A 5.5 million. This resulted in a positive effect from the reversal of the currency translation reserve
in the amount of A 1.2 million.

Within remaining other expenses, personnel expenses are recognized in the amount of A 20.8 million
(previous year: A 24.8 million) which in the reporting year mainly related to severances for former
members of the Executive Board as well as restructuring expenses. In the previous year, this was
particularly due to a severance payment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff
as well as further personnel expenses in connection with the merging of the German sales companies. The
recurring personnel expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective specialist departments. The
remaining other expenses in the previous year were influenced by the termination of the distribution
agreement with the Belgian sales partner Omega Pharma and the associated damage payments.

In the reporting period, the item for remaining other expenses included consulting services in connection
with the 2017 takeover by Bain Capital and Cinven in the amount of A 45.0 million, which is considered a

F-276

special item in the financial year. Other consulting expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective
specialist departments.

The item ‘‘other expenses’’ included in the previous year expenses in the amount of A 21.6 million in
connection with the termination of substantial parts of the aesthetics business. These expenses particularly
resulted from impairments to intangible assets, impairments to financial assets, a payment for the
termination of the distribution agreement, the reduction in inventories, outstanding rental payments and
severance payments.

**18. Financial result**

The **result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2017 relates to the companies**
BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS and AELIA SAS as well as
Dialogfarma LLC and are accounted for using the equity method.

**Investment income primarily relates to profit distributions from companies not included in the Consolidated**
Financial Statements.

**Financial income and financial expenses are composed of the interest result and other financial income and**
other financial expenses.

The interest result developed as follows:

**in E k** **2017** **2016**

Interest income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,462 2,716

IAS 39:

- loans and receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,462 2,716

- financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss . . . . . . . . �14,258 �12,711

- held-to-maturity investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — —

- available-for-sale financial assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — —

- financial liabilities measured at amortized costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �35,304 �39,120

In addition, the interest result in financial year 2017 included a net interest expense from other
non-current provisions, which comprises interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from
pension obligations and other non-current provisions, in the amount of A 0.9 million (previous year:
A 1.1 million).

In financial year 2017, the Group refinanced itself at interest rates of between 0.8% p.a. and 27.0% p.a.
(previous year: between 0.7% p.a. and 26.0% p.a.). As of the balance sheet date December 31, 2017, the
weighted average interest rate for nun-current financial liabilities was approximately 25.51% p.a. (previous
year: approx. 1.66% p.a.). The strong increase over the previous year is attributable to the high interest
rates in Argentina. The non-current financial liabilities reported as of December 31, 2017 in the STADA
Group relate exclusively to the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier S.A. As of the balance sheet date
December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate for current financial liabilities was approximately
1.78% p.a. (previous year: approx. 3.12% p.a.).

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to A 1.5 million in financial
year 2017 (previous year: A 1.4 million). A capitalization rate of 1.6% for intangible assets (previous year:
2.0%) was taken as a basis.

- from the disposal of financial instruments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 728

The result from the measurement of financial instruments in the reporting year resulted from interest rate
swaps and interest rate/currency swaps measured at fair value through profit or loss which expired in the
fourth quarter of 2017 as planned. The measurement of interest rate hedge transactions thereby depends
on the development of the money market interest rate.

Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments resulted in the previous year within the scope of the
early utilization of interest rate swaps.

**19. Income taxes**

The item income taxes includes taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as
well as deferred tax liabilities. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to the sales,
administration or research and development functions are included in other expenses.

Actual income taxes recognized in the income statement can be divided according to timing as follows:

The effective income tax rate amounted to 35.9% for financial year 2017. The effective income tax rate in
the previous year was 25.1%. The nominal income tax rate amounted to 28.3% in financial year 2017 for
STADA Arzneimittel AG in Germany, this includes corporation tax with a tax rate of 15.0% and the
solidarity surcharge in the amount of 5.5% as well as trade income tax with an assessment rate of 357%.
The nominal income tax rate of STADA Arzneimittel AG is thus unchanged as compared to the previous
year.

For temporary differences from undistributed earnings of subsidiaries in the amount of A 17.6 million, no
deferred tax liabilities were established, because these profits will be reinvested for an indefinite period.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement
was derived from the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by
applying the nominal tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Bad Vilbel to earnings before taxes. The

Deviations in the local tax rate resulted for the most part from low nominal tax rates in the United
Kingdom and Russia.

Tax effects from loss/interest carryforwards resulted for the most part from unusable interest expenses due
to the interest barrier rule that was newly-introduced in the United Kingdom in 2017.

Tax effects from tax rate changes resulted, as was the case in the previous year, for the most part from a
lowering of the tax rate in the United Kingdom as of April 1, 2017.

The tax effects from the deconsolidation resulted from the change of control at STADA Vietnam J.V. and
the change of status associated with it.

Deferred tax liabilities reported by STADA resulted, among other things, from deferred taxes in the
context of purchase price allocations carried out under IFRS 3. The reduction in deferred tax liabilities
from intangible assets compared with the previous year was primarily a result of scheduled amortization on
intangible assets with purchase price allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as from
impairments on such assets.

Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under
‘‘Tax loss carryforwards’’, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the
balance sheet date on the December 31, 2017 reporting date amounted to A 25.7 million in financial year
2017 (previous year: A 30.9 million).

Tax effects from loss and interest carryforwards led in the financial year to an increase in the income tax
expense in the amount of A 3.1 million (previous year: reduction in the income tax expense by
A 6.1 million). This development was primarily influenced by British tax law which, from April 1, 2017 for
the first time limits the deduction of operating expenses for interest (interest barrier) which led to an
interest carryforward for which no deferred tax assets were established.

The future usable tax loss carryforwards and similar items are listed in the following chart according to
their expiry date:

shares by means of a change to the Articles of Incorporation. The change to the Articles of Incorporation was entered in the
commercial register on December 9, 2016 and took effect on this date. Therefore, since that time, the authorization from
approved capital pursuant to Section 6 (1) of the Articles of Incorporation therefore relates to registered shares with no
transferability restrictions.

**Personnel expenses (in** E million) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **387.5** **365.7**

The average number of employees in the reporting year was approximately at the level of the previous year
at 10,832 (previous year: 10,839). The significant additions to the number of employees reached are based
on the acquisition of a Serbian product portfolio including the associated sales structures, the purchase of
the British branded product company Natures Aid and the assumption of sales activities in Belgium.
Although all three measures were attributable to financial year 2016, they nevertheless resulted in an
increase in personnel mainly in the reporting year. Furthermore, there was an increase in the number of
employees resulting from the initial consolidation of the Serbian wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o. in 2017. This
was countered by the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as of November 30, 2017 and the average
number of employees thus remained at the level of the previous year. As of the balance sheet date, the
STADA Group’s number of employees in 2017 decreased by 7% to 10,176 (previous year: 10,923), this
reduction resulted mainly from the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V.

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their
functional relevance, increased in financial year 2017 to A 387.5 million (previous year: A 365.7 million).
The increase resulted, among other things, from the increase in the number of employees in Belgium, the
United Kingdom and Serbia.

**23. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses (Continued)**

While depreciation and amortization are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according
to their functional relevance, there is a presentation within other expenses for impairment losses.

The impairment of intangible assets concerns various drug approvals and trademarks, the scheduled
amortization of which is reported within cost of sales.

Impairment losses on financial assets recognized in the reporting year relate to a number of items which,
individually, were immaterial. In the previous year, impairment losses resulted for the most part from the
termination of substantial parts of the aesthetics business.

Depreciation and amortization increased by 4.9% compared to the previous year. More information on
amortization, depreciation and impairment losses is included in the Notes on non-current assets.

**24. Intangible assets (Continued)**

Additions from business combinations according to IFRS 3, which relate to the fair value calculated in the
context for the purchase price allocations resulted in the reporting year from the acquisition of the Serbian
wholesaler Velexfarm d.o.o.

In the reporting year, reclassifications of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale relate to
STADA Vietnam J.V., which in the previous year was considered as IFRS 5 reporting.

In the reporting year, reclassifications of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale relate to an
approval for an Italian branded product.

The umbrella brand Hemofarm capitalized in 2006 in the context of the acquisition of the Hemofarm
group is included in recognized trademarks as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, as STADA
intends to make continuing use of it. As at December 31, 2017, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount
of A 38.9 million (previous year: A 37.4 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31,
2017, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.8% were used. There was no necessity for impairment
in the reporting year. In addition, the change compared to the previous year figure of A 1.5 million is
attributable to different exchange rates.

Furthermore, in the context of the control achieved over Pymepharco in 2013, the umbrella brand
Pymepharco was capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life as a trademark, as STADA
intends to continue to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2017, these have a carrying amount of
A 8.6 million (previous year: A 9.7 million). The change is a result of different exchange rates. In the context
of the impairment test of December 31, 2017, a royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 12.5% were used.
There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

As part of the acquisition of Laboratorio Vannier in the previous year, the umbrella brand Vannier was
capitalized as an intangible asset and an indefinite useful life as a trademark as STADA intends to continue
to use the trademark. As at December 31, 2017, this umbrella brand has a carrying amount of A 0.2 million
(previous year: A 0.3 million). In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2017, a royalty rate of
2% and a discount rate of 17.8% were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2017 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the
production of a qualifying asset amounted to A 1.5 million (previous year: A 1.4 million). In financial year
2017, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was
1.6% (previous year: 2.0%).

Development costs of A 23.9 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: A 31.0 million).
Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the
costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly
allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful life (generally 20 years). STADA immediately recognizes development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization as expense in the period in which they are incurred (see Note 15.). In financial year 2017,
these development costs amounted to of A 67.5 million (previous year: A 65.1 million).

Amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is
recognized in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an
amount of A 86.5 million (previous year: A 83.5 million).

In financial year 2017, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of
A 55.7 million (previous year: A 61.8 million). As in the previous year, no valuation allowances on goodwill
were recorded in the reporting year.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Note on the scope of consolidation
(see Note 5.).

In comparison with the previous year, there were changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill which were
for the most part exclusively currency related. The only addition resulted from the acquisition of the
Serbian wholesaler Velexfarm in the amount of A 0.1 million which was mainly allocated to the Generics
segment.

In the context of the regular impairment tests for capitalized goodwill of September 30, 2017, the
discounted cash flow method was used to determine anticipated cash inflows, applying the following
parameters defined for the individual cash-generating units according to segment:

**Growth rates**
**of the**
**forward-project**
**phase 2017** **WACCs 2017**
**According to segment, defined as cash-generating unit** **in %** **in %**

Branded Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5% 10.0%

In the previous year, the applied parameters were as follows:
**Growth rates**
**of the**
**forward-project**
**phase 2016** **WACCs 2016**
**According to segment, defined as cash-generating unit** **in %** **in %**

Generics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4% 10.3%
Branded Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.7% 10.0%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three
years. This detailed planning period reflects the assumptions for short and medium-term market
developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth
rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning
period for the determination of the value in use is based on assumptions in light of past experience,
supplemented by current internal developments and verified through external market data and analyses.
The most important assumptions include the development of future sales prices, amounts and costs, the
influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market shares, exchange rates and growth
rates. Significant changes to the above-described assumptions would influence the determination of the
value in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates applied are determined on the basis of
external factors derived from the market and adjusted for the respective predominant risks of the
cash-generating units.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of
cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the different cash-generating
units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage
points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Using these assumptions, there was also no
necessity for an impairment to any cash-generating unit.

The disclosure relates to the accounting of shares in the associates BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, as
well as Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS, AELIA SAS and Dialogfarma LLC using the equity method.

For the former Vietnamese subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was signed in the fourth quarter of
financial year 2017 for the sale of the shares held by in the company as of December 31, 2019. For STADA,
this was associated with the loss of control in this company. The company will now also be consolidated as
an associate in the Consolidated Financial Statements until the time of the sale.

The increase in investments accounted for at equity resulted in financial year 2017 from the inclusion of
the company STADA Vietnam J.V. as an associate. The equity carrying amount corresponds to the
contractually agreed selling price for the sale on December 31, 2019 of the shares held by STADA under
consideration of a relevant discounting effect. Changes in the equity carrying amount arise for this
company exclusively from discounting effects, eventual dividend distributions and from currency
translation.

Materials and supplies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 91,638 93,156

In financial year 2017, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of
inventories in the amount of A 43.2 million (previous year: A 28.2 million), which were already deducted
from the amounts shown above through profit and loss. In financial year 2017, reversals here amounted to
A 7.2 million (previous year: A 7.7 million).

**32. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid
financial investments with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries,
specific transactions are subjected to special monitoring in the context of the requirements of the
respective national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions on disposal for cash and cash
equivalents amount to A 2.7 million (previous year: A 2.3 million) and, as in the previous year, exclusively
relate to cash and cash equivalents in China.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from A 352.6 million as of December 31, 2016 to A 243.2 million
as of December 31, 2017 resulted from the effects described as part of the explanations of the consolidated
cash flow statement. Further details on the development of cash and cash equivalents can be found in the
consolidated cash flow statement.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities**

As of December 31, 2017, in the STADA Group, an asset held for sale in the amount of A 1.8 million
presented in a separate line item in the balance sheet. This includes, among other things, a building from a
German subsidiary that is held for sale as well as an intangible asset from an Italian subsidiary that is held
for sale.

In the previous year as part of a disposal group of assets held for sale in the amount of A 83.0 million or
liabilities in the amount of A 14.6 million from the two subsidiaries STADA Vietnam J.V., Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam and STADA Import/Export International Ltd., Hong Kong, China were presented in a
separate line item in the balance sheet because at that point in time a disposal in the near term was seen as
highly probable. As of December 31, 2017 there was no longer, in relation to these two companies, any
recognition of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as liabilities in connection with
the assets.

This resulted on the one hand in the sale in the first quarter of 2017 of the subsidiary STADA Import/
Export International Ltd. Here there was a gain from the deconsolidation of this company in the amount
of A 0.2 million, which is recognized in income from the disposal of non-current assets within other income.

On the other hand, with regard to the subsidiary STADA Vietnam J.V., a contract was signed for the sale of
the shares held in the company by STADA as of December 31, 2019. For STADA, this was associated with
the loss of control in this company. The company will now be consolidated as an associate in the
Consolidated Financial Statements until the time of the sale. In connection with the loss of control in this
company, there was a total loss in the amount of A 5.5 million which is recognized in losses from the
disposal of non-current assets within other expenses.

**34. Equity**

Group equity amounted to A 1,006.4 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: A 1,047.1 million).
This corresponds to an equity ratio of 31.4% (previous year: 30.4%).

**34.1. Share capital**

As of December 31, 2017, share capital amounted to A 162,090,344.00 (December 31, 2016:
A 162,090,344.00) and was divided into 62,342,440 registered shares (December 31, 2016: 62,342,440), each
with an arithmetical share of share capital of A 2.60 per share, and is fully paid. Each share grants one vote
in the General Meeting.

As of December 31, 2017, Authorized Share Capital and Conditional Capital were comprised as follows:

**Amount in** E **Shares** **Purpose**

Authorized Capital . . . . . . 77,134,304.00 29,667,040 Increase of share capital (until June 4, 2018)
Conditional Capital 2013 . . 69,188,340.00 26,610,900 Settlement of options and/or conversion
rights (until June 4, 2018) in connection with
issued bonds with warrants and/or convertible
bonds, participation rights and/or
participating bonds in the total nominal
amount of up to A1.0 billion, or in the scope
of a guarantee assumed for bonds with
warrants and/or convertible bonds,
participation rights and/or participating
bonds issued by subordinate Group
companies

**34.2. Capital reserve**

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and particularly include the capital reserve of STADA Arzneimittel AG. Differences from the capital
reserve determined according to the provisions of German commercial law primarily result from the

F-293


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**34. Equity (Continued)**

recognition at their market value of the shares of STADA Arzneimittel AG newly issued in 2003 as well as
the associated treatment of issuing costs, which were deducted from the capital reserve.

Changes in the capital reserve were solely the result of the change in treasury shares in financial year 2017,
as was the case in the previous year.

**34.3. Retained earnings including net income**

Retained earnings including net income comprise net income for the financial year as well as earnings
generated in previous periods, provided these were not distributed, including amounts transferred to
retained earnings. In addition, re-valuations of net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized
through other comprehensive income are reported under this item, taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017, net income in the
amount of A 3.5 million after deferred taxes—not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling
interests—resulted from the remeasurement. It is mainly based on the increase in the discount rate for
various defined benefit plans in the STADA Group underlying the measurement of December 31, 2017 in
comparison with December 31, 2016. In addition, this position also includes currency translation
differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized in equity from performance-oriented pension
plans as well as the deferred taxes they incur which, in financial year 2017, amounted to income recognized
in equity of A 0.1 million.

**34.4. Other reserves**

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. This relates, among other things, to foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the currency translation with no effect on income of financial
statements of companies included in the Group, which are reported in the statement of changes in equity
under the currency translation reserve. The provision for cash flow hedges include the measurement
results from cash flow hedges from the effective portion of the hedge, allowing for respective deferred
taxes.

The reduction of other reserves compared to the previous year primarily resulted from the depreciation of
the Russian ruble and the British pound sterling since December 31, 2016, which has led to expenses from
the currency translation of the companies that are accounted for in the Russian ruble and the pound
sterling.

**34.5. Treasury shares**

As of the balance sheet date, the Company held 84,311 treasury shares (previous year: 85,043), each with
an arithmetical par value of A 2.60, which is equivalent to 0.14% (previous year: 0.14%) of the share
capital. In financial year 2017, 732 treasury shares were sold at an average price of A 51.72 per share within
the scope of an employee stock option program.

**34.6. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders**

Shares relating to non-controlling interests as of December 31, 2017 related to the minority interests of
other shareholders in the subsidiaries Hemofarm Banja Luka, Hemomont, Pymepharco, STADA
Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) and Well Light Investment Services. As a result of the deconsolidation of the
company STADA Import/Export International Ltd. and the deconsolidation of STADA Vietnam J.V. as a
subsidiary in financial year 2017, there are no longer any minority interests of other shareholders included
in these items as of December 31, 2017. The minority interests in STADA Thailand are also no longer
included as of December 31, 2017 due to the increase in the shareholding to 100% of the shares in the
second quarter of 2017.

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the
pension entitlements of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a
pension obligation which was outsourced to a pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed
internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries
in the form of, among other things, insurances, government bonds and securities funds.

In financial year 2017, the plan assets of one international subsidiary exceeded their pension obligations,
with the result that these assets in excess were reported under other assets as assets from overfunded
pension plans in the amount of A 0.02 million (previous year: A 0.02 million).

Plan assets were divided according to investment type as follows:

The past service cost is accounted for in the reporting year for the most part by a special event in the
United Kingdom with the following background: At the company Thornton & Ross Ltd., the performanceoriented pension plan was concluded as of June 30, 2002 and frozen in such a way that the funds paid into
it up to that point would no longer grow with the salary, but in accordance with the statutory entitlement
adjustment requirement. A review in 2017 showed that the plan participants could interpret the closing
regulation in a way that would mean that the connection of the payments to the salary development was
still in place. On the basis of this interpretation of the regulation, the obligation was increased by
A 1.8 million as past service cost.

Gains from plan assets amounted to A �1.0 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A +7.3 million)
for German Group companies and A 2.1 million for international Group companies (previous year:
A 9.0 million).

The reduction in income of plan assets for German Group companies is mainly due to an increase of the
plan assets of an approval to the level of the gross obligation as a result of existing reinsurance; this
decreased as a consequence of the increased actuarial interest rate in financial year 2017. The reduction of
the plan assets outside Germany is mainly attributable to a worse performance of the plan assets in the
United Kingdom and a decrease in the income of the plan assets in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands,
the amount of the plan assets is calculated on the basis of an actuarial measurement and thus depends
decisively on the development of the actuarial interest rate. In financial year 2017, the actuarial interest
rate increased; this led to a reduction of the plan assets and the income.

The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and
pension costs:

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and
contributions to the plan, are expected in the amount of A 0.8 million for German Group companies and
A 3.6 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the
company. For the STADA Group, pension plans in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with 83%. Accordingly, the following details
focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act
(Betriebsrentengesetz—BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are attached to company pension
plans. Regulation and legal precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit
plans are predominantly based upon the final salary and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan
participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form of a pension. In the calculation of

**35. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2005G mortality tables were used as a basis for
consideration of mortality and fluctuation.

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a
pension fund. As of December 31, 2017, plan assets amounted to A 42.5 million and were composed of
three different plans. There were no plan assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany,
as the material obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally.
Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development and the risk that the real
future salary development exceeds the salary development derived from assumptions taken in the
evaluation.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board Hartmut Retzlaff was
transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due
to the secondary liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with
IAS 19 and measure and recognize it accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a
provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out at the time of the plan amendment for this
benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions are expected in the
future.

Pension legislation in the Netherlands requires pension plans to be backed by assets to such an extent that
the vested benefits are completely covered. The underlying average career pension plan in the Netherlands
is, in part, financed via insurance contributions that are designed to fulfill the aforementioned
requirement. The plan is open for new employees and contains benefits that fall due in case of retirement
or early death.

In the Netherlands, the pension plan is, in part, financed via contributions to an insurance company. Assets
received by the insurance company thereby cannot be allocated to specific participating companies. The
assets cannot be determined by a quoted active market price, instead they are determined according to the
amount of vested benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2017, plan assets amounted to A 26.3 million.

The Dutch company pays annual pension contributions. In the process, life expectancy risk and interest
rate risk are transferred to the insurance company. The insurance company also assumes the risk of
investing the contributions. These risks are assumed by the insurance company for the entire term of the
contract. If, for example, the discount rate used by the insurance company in its calculations should
change, a new contract could be concluded that applies the new discount rate to underlie only future
contributions received.

Not all risks have been transferred to the insurance company. Dutch law specifies that former employees
have the right to transfer their pension entitlements to the pension plan of a new employer. If the
evaluation assumptions applied in the transfer differ from the originally applied assumptions of the
insurance, the company could be required to pay an additional contribution payment. In the calculation of
the amount of the pension obligations and plan assets, the assumptions of the AG forecast table 2016 were
used as a basis for consideration of the mortality. Company-specific age-related annual fluctuation rates
serve as a fluctuation assumption.

In the United Kingdom, STADA provides its employees with defined benefit plans that are concluded for
new hires. The employees can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension
plan plans are subject to the UK Trust Law and the UK Pension Regulator. The pension plans are
monitored by trustees who determine the investment strategy. The trustees are also responsible for
fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient assets to cover the
technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and
participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the
discount rate is low, the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional
contributions. There is a financing risk in plan assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to
expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for changes in the obligations.

**35. Other non-current provisions (Continued)**

In the long-term, 40% of the plan assets in the United Kingdom should be invested in so-called matching
assets, which guarantee the fulfillment of future pension obligations under changing market conditions. In
accordance with target allocation, the remaining 60% should be invested in so-called growth assets, for
which an above-average return is expected in comparison with the obligation development. As of
December 31, 2017, plan assets amounted to A 23.5 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an
active market. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the
S2 Series (S2PA) were used as a basis for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table
CMI 2015 as well as the long-term trend toward improved mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are
no longer relevant for the pension plan.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan according to federal pension law
(Bundesgesetz ¨uber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge—BVG). Employees
whose salary exceeds the entry limit are obliged to be insured—this is re-determined periodically. The
BVG requires a minimum plan (the ‘‘BVG minimum’’) that must always be covered. STADA’s Swiss
benefit plan includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The
annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the
age of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the
pension obligations, the BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality
and fluctuation.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group
companies pay defined contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements
or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution
plans, which are reported as expense in the respective period in the relevant functional areas, amounted to
A 26.8 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 23.2 million).

The financing agreements stipulate a right of return for the bonds, promissory note loans or bank loans on
the part of the respective investors in the case of a change of control and a change to STADA’s rating. The
increase in current financial liabilities as well as the decrease in non-current financial liabilities was based
on the reclassification of the promissory note loans, bonds and financial liabilities due to banks currently in
place at STADA Arzneimittel AG. Due to STADA’s financing agreements, the Company anticipates that
repayment could take place in the short term which is why a relevant reclassification of the financial
liabilities in the balance sheet from non-current to current liabilities was undertaken. Nidda Healthcare
Holding AG (now Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH), as part of the takeover offer, agreed to provide
STADA with financing for the financing amounts for which an early repayment of the STADA financing is
upcoming.

The contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows, as of the reporting date December 31, 2017, from
interest payments and repayment of financial liabilities for the coming years can be seen in the following

**Other Disclosures**

**41. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure,
financing, changes in exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in
foreign currencies or through changes in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from
operating activities decreased to A 262.9 million in the reporting year (previous year: A 333.5 million). This
development resulted primarily from significantly higher cash outflows as compared with the previous year
in connection with inventories, trade receivables as well as trade payables. The cash-effective increase in
inventories was attributable, among other things, to additions at ALIUD PHARMA to secure the ability to
deliver within the scope of health insurance tenders. In addition, trade receivables were strongly impacted
by decreasing factoring volumes.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments reduced by the inflows from
disposals. This amounted to A �122.6 million in the reporting year (previous year: A �171.8 million).

In financial year 2017, payments for investments in intangible assets in the amount of A 70.2 million
(previous year: A 76.1 million) were made, of which A 39.5 million (previous year: A 33.4 million) related to
significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product portfolio. Proceeds
from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to A 5.7 million (previous year: A 11.0 million) in the
financial year.

The cash flow from investing activities was particularly influenced by payments for investments in
intangible assets in the financial year 2017, primarily relating to advance payments made for the
development of approvals, trademarks and licence acquisitions in Germany and the United Kingdom.
Within the scope of business combinations, there were pay-outs for the final purchase price payment from
the acquisition of the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier as well as for the acquisition of the Serbian
pharmaceutical wholesaler Velexfarm and a Serbian product portfolio. In the previous year, there were
significantly higher pay-outs for business combinations, mainly for the acquisition of a product portfolio in
Serbia, the acquisition of the British Natures Aid and the Argentinian Laboratorio Vannier.

**41. Notes to the cash flow statement (Continued)**

Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies in financial year 2017 related exclusively to
the sale of shares in the Chinese STADA Import/Export International Ltd. The selling price was A 6 k and
was paid in cash. Assets in the total amount of A 1.7 million and liabilities in the total amount of
A 1.7 million were hereby disposed of.

Cash flow from financing activities amounts to A �227.8 million in financial year 2017 (previous year:
A 54.3 million) and encompasses payments from changes in financial liabilities, dividend distribution
payments and payments for treasury shares as well as additions to shareholders’ equity. This development
was particularly attributable to a significantly lower borrowing of funds compared with the comparable
period in the previous year. The repayment and borrowing of funds in 2017 shown in the cash outflow from
financing activities was effected by the following facts: the financing agreements stipulate a right of return
for the bonds, promissory note loans or bank loans on the part of the respective investors in the case of a
change of control and a change to STADA’s rating. Nidda Healthcare Holding AG (now Nidda Healthcare
Holding GmbH), as part of the takeover offer, agreed to provide STADA with financing for the financing
amounts for which an early repayment of the STADA financing is upcoming. In 2017, a loan in the amount
of A 40.0 million was already granted by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH in this connection. The
resulting cash inflows were allocated to cash flow from financing activities.

Dividend distribution payments at A 44.8 million primarily related to the dividend paid to the shareholders
of STADA Arzneimittel AG for financial year 2016.

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities
amounted to A 140.2 million in financial year 2017 (previous year: A 161.8 million).

Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

**42. Segment reporting**

The measurement approaches for segment reporting are in accordance with the financial reporting
methods used in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements. Services between the segments are charged
based on market prices.

Segmentation within the STADA Group is based on sales differentiation. Thus, the allocation to the
individual segments is determined to a large extent by the sales positioning. If this positioning changes for
parts of the product portfolio, associated sales are reallocated.

According to the new reporting structure, which was introduced in the previous year, the Group is
managed by operating segment, i.e. according to the two segments Generics and Branded Products.

Generics are products for the health care market—usually with a drug character—which contain one or
several active ingredients whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning
complies with one of the two following criteria:

- The product is offered by emphasizing its low price, usually in contrast to the product of another
supplier which contains the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient

F-307

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**42. Segment reporting (Continued)**

or

- the product is an integral part of a marketing concept targeting more than one product and indication
for primarily prescription products with active ingredients whose commercial property rights have
expired,

or

- the product is sold under its international non-proprietary name (INN).

Branded Products are products for the health care market which contain one or several active ingredients
whose commercial property rights have expired and whose sales positioning complies with one of the two
following criteria:

- The product is sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products,

or

- the product is part of a marketing concept for primarily non-prescription products which are mainly
sold under a product-specific brand name and with emphasis on different specific product
characteristics which aim at a unique position of the product in contrast to competitive products and
other Group products.

All other income, expenses and assets, which cannot be directly allocated to the segments, as well as the
elimination of sales between segments are recognized under the reconciliation Group holdings/other and
consolidation.

Disclosures on significant non-cash items include impairments on inventories and receivables; they do not,
however, include depreciation and amortization as well as the offsetting of impairments and write-ups. In
addition, further non-cash items, particularly non-cash effects from accruals for health insurance
organization billings are included here. Reporting of the segment liabilities and non-current segment assets
is waived, as this is without relevance for Group monitoring and for Group reporting.

In the presentation of sales by the company’s business premises, sales to third parties are shown according
to the invoicing company’s registered office of the countries listed.

Disclosures on assets by country relate to parts of the non-current assets (intangible assets, property, plant
and equipment).

**42.4. Information on important customers**

In accordance with IFRS 8.34, a company must provide notification when sales revenues from business
activities from a single external customer or customer group amount to at least 10% of the company’s total
sales revenues. This applied to one customer in the reporting year. The sales revenues identified with this
customer amounted to A 313.3 million. The sales revenues generated were attributable to the Generics
segment and the Branded Products segment. In the previous year, this did not apply to any customers.

**43. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations to third parties based on past events but which will not
become manifest until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not under
STADA’s control. As of the balance sheet date, these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and
are therefore not accounted. In addition, there are also contingent liabilities for current obligations, for
which however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable or the amount of the
obligation cannot be adequately estimated.

STADA has contingent liabilities, among other things, in connection with patent risks for certain active
pharmaceutical ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The resulting possible
obligations amounted to approx. A 11.6 million (previous year: A 12.9 million). Development as compared
to the previous year are based primarily on the elimination of possible obligations from patent risks in the
amount of A 4.6 million. Furthermore, a changed estimate with regard to the volume of impending
resource outflows for patent risks that existed already in the previous year as well as potential obligations
as a result of a ban on economic activities between Russia and Ukraine led to an increase in contingent
liabilities in the amount of A 3.3 million.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**43. Contingent liabilities (Continued)**

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under
50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**44. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations, which can be
broken down as follows:

**in E k** **Dec. 31, 2017** **Dec. 31, 2016**

Operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 121,317 69,111
Other financial obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69,085 42,460

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **190,402** **111,571**

Liabilities from operating leases relate, among other things, to IT equipment and vehicles. In addition,
there are liabilities from long-term rental agreements for office buildings with an average contract term of
5 years. The increase as compared to the previous year resulted mainly from long-term obligations for
logistics services.

The total of future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to A 121.3 million as of the
end of the financial year (previous year: A 69.1 million) and can be broken down according to remaining
term as follows:

**Operating leases**
**in E k** **Dec. 31, 2017** **Dec. 31, 2016**

Remaining terms up to 1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31,912 28,673

Lease payments in the amount of A 32.2 million (previous year: A 32.4 million) were recognized as an
expense in financial year 2017.

There is still a guarantee amounting to A 25.0 million towards Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, in
connection with a supply agreement between Hospira and the shares in the associate BIOCEUTICALS
Arzneimittel AG which are recognized under the equity method.

STADA, as guarantor, has continued to recognize this guarantee as a financial guarantee in accordance
with IAS 39 with a fair value in the amount of A 0.3 million in the reporting year (previous year:
A 0.3 million). Utilization of this guarantee granted is currently not expected.

The increase in other financial liabilities resulted primarily from new validity contingent liabilities in
Belgium and the United Kingdom. In total, such liabilities in the STADA Group amounted to
A 37.4 million as of December 31, 2017.

Furthermore, additional guarantees assumed by the STADA Group are included in other financial
liabilities, among other things.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**45. Disclosures about financial instruments (Continued)**

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade receivables mainly have short remaining terms, their
carrying amounts as of the closing date correspond approximately to the fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of
promissory note loans, bonds, as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the
current yield curve were discounted to the measurement date to determine the fair values for liabilities to
credit institutes. Due to the short-term maturity of the promissory note loan, the stated fair value
corresponds to the nominal value.

Available-for-sale financial assets are primarily the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated
investments which are entirely measured at amortized cost for lack of available market prices.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables as well as of held-to-maturity financial investments with
remaining terms of more than a year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the
assets taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in the conditions and expectations. Trade payables as well as remaining financial liabilities
also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized values approximate the fair values.

For the disclosures according to class of financial instrument necessary in accordance with IFRS 7, STADA
defines each valuation category as a class.

The chart below shows how the valuation rates of financial instruments measured at fair value were
determined for the respective classes of financial instruments:

**Level 2 Valuation methods** **Level 3 Valuation methods**
**Level 1 Quoted prices in** **with input parameters** **with input parameters not**

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, STADA reviews the allocation to the
respective hierarchy levels according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If the
need for reclassification is determined, the reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the
reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications among the respective hierarchy
levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose,
market comparisons and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FAHfT) and derivative financial liabilities (FLHfT) include positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (foreign exchange swaps, in the previous year interest
rate and currency swaps) not part of a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards are

determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a reputable information
service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures. In
the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third
parties.

STADA designates currency forwards (EUR/RUB), (EUR/DKK), (EUR/CHF), (EUR/USD) and (EUR/
GBP) as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company loans. The
changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency
exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value
hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this
hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively
on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.

The chart below shows how the valuation rates of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
were determined:

Non-current assets and
disposal groups held
for sale . . . . . . . . . . — — 1,827 — — —

The assets classified as held for sale relate to a real-estate property of a STADA subsidiary in Germany,
the sale of which is intended in the short term and therefore a reclassification from non-current assets was
undertaken. The non-recurring basis for the determination of fair value represents a valuation created by
an independent expert, which was largely based on input parameters observable in the market. In addition,
this item includes an intangible asset from a STADA subsidiary in Italy. The non-recurring basis for the
calculation of fair value is provided by the confirmation of a purchase price by a third party with whom a
purchase contract was signed.

As STADA utilizes pricing information from external third parties without further correction in the
determination of the fair value, and therefore did not produce any quantitative, non-observable input
factors, the option of IFRS 13 to waive the disclosure of quantitative information on such input factors was
taken.

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in
the interest result. Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the
valuation results from interest rate/currency swaps and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value through
profit or loss, which are reported under financial income or financial expenses and partially also in the
currency translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made in other
income or other expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to the fulfillment of
cross-currency swaps and currency swaps.

**45.3. Factoring**

**Factoring transactions with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks**

There are two revolving receivable selling agreements with banks and financial institutes (together
‘‘receivables buyers’’) with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks without a general purchase
limit. The agreements have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby STADA is
free to decide if and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant
for the risk evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed
payment (late payment risk). In return for a fixed program fee recognized in expenses at the time of
derecognition, both risks are fully transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The nominal volume of
receivables sold by STADA but not yet paid under the factoring agreements amounted to A 28.6 million on
the reporting date.

**Factoring transactions with distribution of essential opportunities and risks for which control of the**
**asset remains with STADA**

There are factoring agreements pursuant to which STADA, on a revolving basis, sells trade receivables up
to a total general purchase limit of A 153.3 million to banks and financial institutes. The agreements have
an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby STADA is free to decide if and in what
amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk evaluation with
regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk).
The credit risk is partially transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The late payment risk continues to be
borne in its entirety by STADA. The maximum credit risk to be borne by STADA, translated into euro,
amounted to A 3.5 million as of the reporting date. The other credit-risk related defaults are assumed by
the buyer. The late payment risk continues to be borne in its entirety by STADA. The maximum risk of loss
for STADA resulting from the credit risk and the late payment risk from the receivables sold as of the
reporting date, translated into euro, amounted to A 3.8 million. The nominal volume of receivables sold by
STADA but not yet paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to A 82.9 million

on the reporting date. The ongoing commitment of STADA as of December 31, 2017, translated into euro,
amounted to A 3.8 million and the carrying amounts of the associated liability, translated into euro,
amounted to A 3.8 million.

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**

**46.1. Principles of risk management**

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at
least once annually by the Executive Board in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, all
transactions above a certain limit determined to be relevant by the Executive Board must first be approved
by the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount
of current risks.

**46.2. Currency risks**

STADA’s Group and balance sheet currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business
activities, STADA is subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in
a currency other than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation
(transaction risk).

However, STADA is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters risks from
currency related fluctuations through, alongside natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments.
These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial transactions and investments. In
the reporting year, STADA made use of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/currency swaps.
The maturity dates of futures contracts are thereby selected to match the Company’s anticipated cash
flows. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year.

In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations
lead to an accounting effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the
conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency
than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as compared to the other currencies is generally
negative and depreciation is generally positive.

STADA determines quantitative disclosures on risks in connection with currency changes by means of
aggregating all of the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective
Group company’s functional currency. In case of hedging transactions they are compared with the balances
of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding
foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which in case of a change to the foreign

currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% depreciation of the euro in comparison respective

depreciation of the euro in
comparison to the respective
functional currency by 10% . . . +2,178 �3,126 +1,968 +2,552 �2,796 +2,669

Here, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items in Kazakhstani tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia relate to a balance
from international Group companies in euro and outstanding foreign currency reserves in Kazakhstani
tenge and Ukrainian hryvnia. The reported outstanding foreign currency positions in US dollar relate
exclusively to foreign currency holdings in US dollar at German and international Group companies. The
risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective,
results from the functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall, based on
outstanding foreign currency items as of the reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the
respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would have
led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of A 2.2 million (previous year: A 2.6 million) or in
the amount of earnings of A 2.2 million (previous year: A 2.6 million).

**46.3. Interest rate risks**

STADA is subject to interest risks from the investment of financial assets as well as financial debts,
primarily in the Euro zone.

In order to minimize the effects of significant interest rate fluctuations, STADA manages the interest rate
risk for the financial liabilities denominated in euro with hedging transactions. Currently there are no cash
flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps. In 2017, an average of 88% (previous year: 85%) of
financial liabilities denominated in euro had fixed interest rates. In the previous year, 100% of those
denominated in ruble had fixed interest rates, while in the current financial year there are no financial
liabilities denominated in ruble.

**46. Risk management, derivative financial instruments and disclosures on capital management**
**(Continued)**

STADA calculates existing interest rate risks using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following
factors—if relevant—are generally included in the calculation:

- Changes in the market interest rate of interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments in
the context of cash flow hedges,

- changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are
not hedged against interest rate risks, and

- Changes in the market interest rate of interest derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

The interest-rate risk at STADA is of secondary importance.

**46.4. Default risks**

STADA is exposed to a default risk in its operating business or as a result of financing activities if
contracting parties fail to meet their obligations. Alongside the implementation of appropriate credit
management processes, such transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable
financial standing to avoid default risks in financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. STADA therefore strives to maintain
business relations only with partners of impeccable financial standing. In addition, STADA partly uses
suitable measures such as guarantees, loan insurances or the transfer of assets to safeguard itself against
default risk. Past due receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored and potential default
risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that in a
difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments
to STADA or business partners of STADA and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks
arise.

STADA’s maximum credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets
recognized. In addition, STADA granted guarantees, which amounted to a total nominal volume of
A 63.1 million (previous year: A 28.0 million) as of the reporting date (see Note 44.). STADA has various
forms of collateral for credit securities such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of
receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets
and customers.

**46.5. Liquidity risks**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit,
reduced access to financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of
the liquidity management is to ensure solvency and financial flexibility of the STADA Group at all times by
way of maintaining a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves. STADA finances itself with short-term and
long-term borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, STADA also
has solid operating cash flow.

**46.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments**

STADA counters risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are
exclusively used to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial
transactions and investments. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation
purposes.

STADA designates currency forwards (EUR/RUB), (EUR/DKK), (EUR/CHF), (EUR/USD) and (EUR/
GBP) as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from inter-company loans. The
changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective currency
exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the currency forwards. The objective of fair value
hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this
hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively
on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.
In the reporting period, new fair value hedges with a nominal volume totaling A 161.5 million were
designated for reduction of the fair value risk (previous year period: A 0). At STADA, as of December 31,
2017, there were currency derivatives with a net fair value of -A 566 k (December 31, 2016: A 0) which were
designated as hedging instruments within the scope of fair value hedges. Losses recognized in currency
translation result of A 863 k (2016: A 0) resulted in financial year 2017 from the carrying amount
adjustment of the underlying transaction, from the changes in fair values of the hedging transactions,
profits of A 863 k (2016: A 0) were recognized in currency translation result.

**46.7. Disclosures on capital management**

The objectives of the STADA capital management are the safeguarding of the business operation, the
creation of a solid equity base for financing profitable growth as well as guaranteeing attractive dividend
payments and the capital service. The STADA capital management consistently aims for the Group
companies to have an equity basis that corresponds to the local requirements. When implementing and
checking the Group’s capital and liquidity the legal requirements are taken into account.

Capital is monitored on the basis of net debt, which results from current and non-current financial
liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents. An important key figure for capital management at STADA is
the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which amounted to 2.4 in financial year 2017 (previous year: 2.8).

In summary, the following disclosures regarding the remuneration of the Executive Board and Supervisory

Members of the Supervisory
Board . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,089[17] 1,072[18] — — — — — — 1,089 1,072

The variable current remuneration of Executive Board members which, as in the previous year was
reported within other liabilities, includes a share-based payment as a long-term oriented remuneration
component, which is paid in cash. The fair value of the share-based payment was calculated using the
Monte Carlo model. The expense for the share-based payment amounted to A 1.0 million in the previous
year. As of December 31, 2017, there was no longer any share-based remuneration because these were
fixed as part of a termination agreement or changeover. This resulted in total expenses in the amount of
A 0.8 million.

As of December 31, 2017 there were outstanding liabilities to members and former members of the
Executive Board in the amount of A 9.6 million.

Remuneration to former members of the Executive Board amounted to a total of A 3,261 k in financial
year 2017. The fair value of pension commitments for former Executive Board members amounted to
A 48,199 k as of December 31, 2017.

There were no loans granted to members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board at STADA
Arzneimittel AG as of the reporting date. Nor has STADA taken on any contingent liabilities for the
benefit of the members of governing bodies of STADA Arzneimittel AG.

12 Thereof A 458 k performance-related and A 3,706 k non-performance related.

13 Thereof A 1,318 k performance-related and A 3,573 k non-performance related.

14 These result from the final calculation of the multi-year variable long-term special remuneration ‘‘long-term goals 2018’’, the
final calculation of the LTIP 2016 and 2017 due to the termination agreement that was concluded.

15 This includes the final calculation of the multi-year variable long-term special remuneration ‘‘long-term targets 2016’’ (year of
target achievement), however only for the period of the actual implementation of the contracts, on which the remuneration is
based, up to December 31, 2015 in the total amount of A 2,052 k.

16 A 1,253 k thereof is attributable to the continued salary payment and A 5,885 k to a severance payment in connection with the
end of the Executive Board appointment of Mr. Retzlaff as of August 15, 2016.

17 Thereof A 316 k performance-related and A 773 k non-performance related.

18 Thereof A 329 k performance-related and A 743 k non-performance related.

_Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and the group management_
_report (Konzernlagebericht) of STADA Arzneimittel AG as of and for the financial year ended December 31,_

_memorandum._

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To STADA Arzneimittel AG, Bad Vilbel

**_REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE_**
**_GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT_**

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG, Bad Vilbel, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2017, the
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated cash flow
statement and consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2017, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary
of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of STADA
Arzneimittel AG, which is combined with the Company’s management report, for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2017. We have not audited the content of those parts of the group management
report listed in the ‘‘Other Information’’ section of our auditor’s report in accordance with the German
legal requirements.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to §

[Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial
position of the Group as at December 31, 2017, and of its financial performance for the financial year
from January 1 to December 31, 2017, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report
does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the ‘‘Other
Information’’ section of our auditor’s report.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management
report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as ‘‘EU
Audit Regulation’’) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in
the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we
have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In
addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have
not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

_Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these

Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:

statements included EUR 396 million (12% of consolidated total assets) for ‘‘Goodwill’’ and
EUR 938 million (29% of consolidated total assets) for ‘‘Regulatory drug approvals, trademarks,
customer relationships, software, licenses and similar rights’’. While goodwill and other intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment (‘‘impairment test’’) on an annual
basis or if there are indications of impairment, such a test needs only to be carried out for
intangible assets with definite useful lives if there are indications of impairment (‘‘triggering
events’’).

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the level of the group of cash-generating units to which the
relevant goodwill is allocated. In an impairment test, the carrying amount of the respective
cash-generating unit (including the affected goodwill) is compared against the higher of the value
in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. In a first step, the Company generally conducts the
test based on the value in use. For the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives, the relief from
royalty method is initially applied.

The Company has identified certain indicators, which are monitored and in case of negative
development trigger an impairment test for assets with definite useful lives. In the case of
regulatory drug approvals, however, an impairment test is carried out in each instance at the end
of the financial year. Brands and regulatory drug approvals are normally measured based on the
present value of future cash flows generated by the affected asset from marketing the respective
products. An impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount is less than the respective
carrying amount.

Present value is calculated using discounted cash flow models. The starting point is the Group’s
three-year financial plan, which is projected forward using growth assumptions. The discount rate
used is the weighted cost of capital for the relevant cash-generating unit or group of
cash-generating units. The result of this measurement depends to a large extent on the estimates
made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows, the discount rate used, the
rate of growth and other assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty.
Against this background and due to the complex nature of the measurement, this matter was of
particular significance for our audit.

(2) As part of our audit, we reviewed the methodological procedure adopted for the purpose of the
impairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted cost of capital, among other things.
We verified the appropriateness of the future cash inflows used in the measurement, including by
comparing these disclosures with the current budgets in the three-year plan prepared by the
executive directors and approved by the Supervisory Board, and by reconciling them against
general and sector-specific market expectations. We also assessed whether the basis for including

the costs of Group functions was accurate. With the knowledge that even relatively small changes
in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the recoverable amounts calculated in
this way, we also focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the
discount rate applied, and evaluated the measurement model. In order to reflect the uncertainty
inherent in the projections, we reproduced the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company
and carried out our own additional sensitivity analyses with respect to those cash-generating units
with low headroom (recoverable amount compared with the carrying amount). Taking into
account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the
cash-generating units, including the allocated goodwill, were adequately covered by the
discounted future net cash inflows. Overall, the measurement inputs and assumptions used by the
executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by
us to be reasonable.

(3) The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and intangible assets are contained in notes 9
‘‘Accounting policies’’ and 24 ‘‘Intangible assets’’ to the consolidated financial statements.

(2) Revenue recognition including expected revenue reductions

(1) The EUR 2,314 million reported under ‘‘Sales’’ in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements relate primarily to the sale of products and provision of services. Since large-volume
transactions are involved, the company has established comprehensive processes and systems for
recognizing and deferring sales. Revenues are recognized when the goods have been delivered or
the services rendered. Amounts are measured at fair value less expected revenue reductions
(including discounts to health insurance organizations, other health sector institutions and
customers, as well as expected returns). When recognizing revenues, material assumptions have
to be made with respect to discounts that must subsequently be granted and returns that must
subsequently be accepted, and the corresponding revenue adjustments have to be recognized.

Particularly in Germany, discount arrangements with health insurance organizations are agreed
for a specific pharmaceutical ingredient by means of tenders over a specific period of time. The
corresponding drug is initially sold to patients at a binding sales price, which is then subject to a
discount subsequently granted to the respective health insurance organization.

The revenue adjustments are based to a large degree on the executive directors’ estimates and
assumptions and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainties. Against this background and
due to the underlying complexity of the measurement on which this significant item in terms of its
amount was based, this matter was of particular significance for our audit.

(2) Our audit included assessing the appropriateness and effectiveness of the processes and controls
within the Company’s internal control system established to realize revenues and make revenue
adjustments, including the IT systems used. To this end, we also involved our specialists from Risk
Assurance Services (RAS). With the knowledge that the complexity of the accounting treatment
and the estimates and assumptions to be made give rise to an increased risk of accounting
misstatements, we assessed the appropriateness of the estimates made by the executive directors
with respect to revenue adjustments. At the same time, we verified and assessed the methodology
applied by the executive directors to make revenue adjustments. We also used the detailed
information obtained to assess the relevant assumptions made by the executive directors as of the
balance sheet date. In addition, we verified the consistency of the methods used by the Company
to recognize revenues and make revenue adjustments. We also compared the revenue
adjustments with contract documents.

In doing so, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates applied and the assumptions
made by the executive directors concerning the recognition and measurement of revenues were
sufficiently documented and that the estimates applied and the assumptions made by the
executive directors were consistently derived.

(3) The Company’s disclosures relating to revenue recognition are contained in notes 9 ‘‘Accounting
policies’’ and 11 ‘‘Sales’’ to the consolidated financial statements.

(3) Inclusion of STADA—VN Joint Venture Co. Ltd., Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

(1) In the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017, STADA—VN Joint
Venture Co. Ltd. ceased to be a consolidated subsidiary, and since November 29, 2017 has instead
been reported as an associate accounted for using the equity method. STADA Arzneimittel AG

F-329


-----

continues to hold a 50% indirect interest in STADA—VN Joint Venture Co. Ltd. The previous
consolidation was based on control over the company within the meaning of IFRS 10 by means of
contractual multiple voting rights. Based on plans to dispose of the 50% equity interest, the assets
and liabilities of STADA—VN Joint Venture Co. Ltd. were reported as held for sale in the
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016, pursuant to IFRS 5. In the course of
the financial year 2017, these plans to dispose of the interest were initially abandoned. The other
shareholder caused the company to temporarily cease interim financial reporting to the Group.
Pursuant to the agreement dated November 29, 2017, the parties have now agreed that the
indirect interest in STADA—VN Joint Venture Co. Ltd. held by STADA Arzneimittel AG will be
sold to the other shareholder as of December 31, 2019, for a fixed selling price. In this context,
the multiple voting right held to date was also relinquished and transferred to the other
shareholder. Significant influence over the company remains. The transfer to accounting using
the equity method resulted in a EUR 5.5 million loss on disposal, which was recognized under
other expenses.

Due to the applicability of Vietnamese law, assessing the potential enforceability of the multiple
voting rights as of November 29, 2017 is very complex and is based to a significant extent on
estimates on the part of the executive directors. Against this background, this matter was of
particular significance for our audit.

(2) In order to audit the correct accounting treatment during the financial year 2017, we began by
examining the contractual agreements between the shareholders, including the agreement dated
November 29, 2017. Furthermore, our assessment included the correspondence exchanged
between the shareholders and information provided by lawyers on the legal validity of the
avoidance of the joint venture agreement and the legal enforceability of the multiple voting right.
In light of our first-time audit of the consolidated financial statements, we obtained further audit
assurance with respect to this matter by examining the prior-year audit report and the prior-year
auditor’s report on the review of the interim consolidated financial statements as of June 30,
2017. We also discussed this matter with the prior-year auditor.

We were able to satisfy ourselves that the inclusion of STADA—VN Joint Venture Co. Ltd. in the
consolidated financial statements, including the transitional consolidation as of November 29,
2017, was clearly documented and sufficiently substantiated.

(3) The Company’s disclosures on the disposal of the interest in STADA—VN Joint Venture Co. Ltd.
and the changes in the scope of consolidation are contained in note 5 ‘‘Scope of consolidation’’ to
the consolidated financial statements.

_Other Information_

The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
following non-audited parts of the group management report:

- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB included in section
‘‘corporate governance report’’ of the group management report

- the corporate governance report pursuant to No. 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code

- the separate non-financial report pursuant to § 289b Abs. 3 HGB and § 315b Abs. 3 HGB

The other information comprises further the remaining parts of the annual report—excluding crossreferences to external information—with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements,
the audited group management report and our auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial_
_Statements and the Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position,
and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such
internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group_
_Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer
(IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group
management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

F-331


-----

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements,
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant
independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

**_OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS_**
