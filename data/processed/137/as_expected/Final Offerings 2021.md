**OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**IN THE UNITED STATES**

### Guala Closures S.p.A.
##### €500,000,000 3 [1]⁄4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028

Guala Closures S.p.A., a società per azioni incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”)
€500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3 [1]⁄4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The proceeds of the Notes will be used to
redeem the Issuer’s existing floating rate senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Existing Notes”) and pay accrued interest thereon, to repay amounts
outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, for general corporate
purposes and to pay fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing (as defined herein). The Offering is being carried out following completion of the
mandatory public tender offer for the shares of the Issuer by Special Packaging Solutions Investments S.à r.l. (“SPSI”), in which SPSI acquired the
majority of the Issuer’s outstanding shares.

The Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to 3.25% per annum. Interest will accrue from the Issue Date (as defined below). The Notes will mature
on June 15, 2028. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on
December 15, 2021. Prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “make-whole”
premium. At any time on or after June 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the prices set forth in this offering memorandum (the
“Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the Notes (including the aggregate
principal amount of any additional Notes issued) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings so long as at least 50% of the original principal
amount of the Notes (excluding any additional Notes), issued under the Indenture (as defined herein) remain outstanding. Prior to June 15, 2024, the
Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional
Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof. In the event of certain developments affecting
taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu
of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem
the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes.
See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control”, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding
Notes at a purchase price of 101% of their principal amount. A change of control triggering event, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with the first such event.

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so
subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). On the Issue Date, no subsidiary of the Issuer will
be required to provide a Notes Guarantee (as defined below). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), the
Notes will be guaranteed (collectively, the “Notes Guarantees” and each, a “Notes Guarantee”) on a senior secured basis by certain of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors” and each a “Guarantor”) within 180 days from the Business Day falling immediately after the Issue Date.
The Notes Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is not subordinated to
such Notes Guarantee. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and may be released under certain circumstances. The
Guarantors will also guarantee the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility on a senior secured basis. Subject to and in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over substantially the same rights, property and assets that secure
the Revolving Credit Facility as further described herein and on the timeframes described herein. See “Description of the Notes—Security”. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any)
and creditors of certain additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future, including certain hedging agreements, will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the security interests in priority to holders of the Notes. The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral will be
subject to the limitations described in “Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral”.

Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”, the Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of
the Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time) or pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as the same may be amended, or
supplemented from time to time) where the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that does not allow for satisfactory exchange of information
with Italy (as per the Ministerial Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance of September 4, 1996 as amended, supplemented and replaced) and
otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. This Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law
on prospectuses for securities dated July 16, 2019. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange upon their issuance. The Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market for the
purposes of the MiFID II (Directive 2014/65/EU).

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered global notes. The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more global notes, which will be
delivered through Euroclear Bank SA/ NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) on July 7, 2021 (the “Issue Date”). See
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 35.**

**Price for the Notes: 100% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date**

**The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended**
**(the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold within the United States**
**except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. In the**
**United States, the Offering is being made only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act) in**
**compliance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance**
**on Regulation S under the Securities Act. You are hereby notified that the initial purchasers of the Notes may be relying on the**
**exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions,**

Memorandum; neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, nor any of
their respective agents shall have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements. See

We are offering the Notes in reliance on an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities
Act for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. The Notes are subject to
restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted
under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction pursuant to

financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. If you purchase the Notes, you will
be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under
“Transfer Restrictions”.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction
in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such
offer or solicitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction
where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and this Offering Memorandum may not be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in
accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering at any time. We are making this offering subject to the
terms described in this Offering Memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to the Notes to be
entered into between us and the Initial Purchasers on or around the date of this Offering Memorandum.
We and the Initial Purchasers may reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part, sell less than
the entire principal amount of the Notes offered hereby or allocate to any purchaser less than all of the
Notes for which it has subscribed. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities
may acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

This Offering Memorandum contains summaries of various documents governing the Notes, believed
to be accurate, of some of the terms of specific documents, but reference is made to the actual documents
for the complete information contained in those documents. You should contact the Issuer or the Initial
Purchasers with any questions about this Offering. All summaries contained herein are qualified in their
entirety by this reference. The contents of any website, including the websites of the Issuer or any member
of the Group, do not form any part of this Offering Memorandum.

The information contained in “Summary”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Business” includes extracts from information and_
data, including industry and market data and estimates, released by third-party industry publications.

data, we have not independently verified the accuracy of such information and data and we accept no
further responsibility in respect of such information and data.

In addition, the information set forth in relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing
clearing arrangements, including under “Description of the Notes” and “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”, is
subject to any change in, or reinterpretation of, the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream currently in effect. While we accept responsibility for accurately summarizing the information
concerning Euroclear and Clearstream as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we accept no further
responsibility in respect of such information.

The Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and the Security Agent make no representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to, and assume no responsibility for, the accuracy or completeness of the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum. Nothing contained in this Offering Memorandum is, or shall be
relied upon as, a promise or representation by any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or the Security
Agent as to the past or the future.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to ask
questions of us, and that you have received all answers you deem necessary to verify the accuracy and
completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You also acknowledge that you
have not relied on any of the Initial Purchasers in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of this
information or your decision whether to invest in the Notes.

Interests in the Notes will be available initially in book-entry form. We expect that the Notes sold will
be issued in the form of one or more global notes. The global notes will be deposited and registered in the
name of a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Transfers of interests in the
global notes will be effected through records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, and
their respective participants. The Notes will not be issued in definitive registered form except under the
circumstances described in the section “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

There is currently no market for the Notes. Application has been made to the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted
to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market upon their issuance may not be
approved as of the settlement date for the Notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is
not conditioned on obtaining this listing and admission to trading. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market, that such permission to deal
in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s
Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on
markets in financial instruments, as amended.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the Initial Purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer
and no one else. Accordingly, in connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers will not be
responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections (regulatory or otherwise)
afforded to their clients or for the giving of advice in relation to the offering of the Notes.

Having made all reasonable enquiries, we confirm that, to the best of our knowledge and belief
(having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), this Offering Memorandum contains all
information that is material in the context of the issuance and offering of the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees, that the information contained in this Offering Memorandum is true and accurate in all
material respects and is not misleading in any material respect and that there are no other facts the
omission of which would make this Offering Memorandum or any such information misleading in any
material respect. The information contained in this Offering Memorandum is accurate as of the date
hereof.

If you are in any doubt about the contents of this Offering Memorandum you should consult your
stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other financial adviser. It should be remembered that
the price of securities and the income from them can go down as well as up and that investing in the Notes
involves substantial risks. See “Risk Factors”.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus
for offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as
amended or superseded), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU
**Member State”) of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).**

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should
only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the
making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail
**investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)**
of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified
investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any
Notes in any EU Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that EU Member State by any measure
implementing the Prospectus Regulation in that EU Member State.

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of
each manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending
the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment;
however, and without prejudice to our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who (i) are
outside the United Kingdom, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the
“Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial
Promotion Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
banking activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the
“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or
caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

(“CONSOB”) (the Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian securities legislation.

_mercados secundarios oficiales, de ofertas públicas de venta o suscripción y del folleto exigible a tales efectos),_

exemption from registration in accordance with such Royal Decree; and (b) by institutions authorized to
provide investment services in Spain under MiFID II, the Securities Market Act (and related legislation)
and Royal Decree 217/2008 of February 15, 2008 on the Legal Regime Applicable to Investment Services
Companies (Real Decreto 217/2008, de 15 de febrero, sobre el régimen jurídico de las empresas de servicios de
_inversión y de las demás entidades que prestan servicios de inversión). This Offering Memorandum has not_
been and will not be registered with the Spanish Securities Market Commission (Comisión Nacional del
_Mercado de Valores) and therefore it is not intended for the public offering or sale of the Notes in Spain._

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the
Notes by such investors occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry Overview” and “Business”, for a more complete_
discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum and,
except as required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed,
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as
a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking
statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,
including those set forth under “Risk Factors”.

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
market in which we operate and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and
forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from internal surveys, customer feedback,
market research, governmental and other publicly available information, independent industry
publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. These third-party sources include information
derived from an industry report that was commissioned from a global consulting company as well as certain
studies and analyses prepared by other independent consultants. In considering the industry and market
data included in this Offering Memorandum, prospective investors should note that this information may
be subject to significant uncertainty due to differing definitions of the relevant markets and market
segments described. While the market and industry information used throughout this Offering
Memorandum has been accurately reproduced, we cannot give any assurance on the accuracy and
completeness of such information and all the projections they contain are based on significant
assumptions. We do not have access to the facts and assumptions underlying any market data, statistical
information and economic indicators contained in these third-party sources. We also do not have access to
the facts and assumptions underlying the projections made in these reports and various economic and
other factors may cause actual results to differ from these projections. See also “Forward-looking
_Statements”._

In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations,
government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, requiring us
to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industry in which we operate, our position
in the industry, our market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on our
experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry publications, including
information made available to the public by our competitors. Furthermore, references in this Offering
Memorandum to Guala’s global addressable Roll-on and Safety closures markets are to the market in
which Guala has historically been competing, including the market for metal screw and cork closures on
metal or glass bottles, while excluding the Russian “grey market” as well as plastic and ceramic closures.
None of the Issuer, the Group or the Initial Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and completeness
of, or take any responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be
reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers can assure you as to the accuracy of such estimates and data or the accuracy of the
underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. Unless otherwise indicated, data on our market
position and market share is based on volume or revenue, depending on the geography, in each case, for
the year ended December 31, 2019, available data reported by certain competitors and certain other
assumptions and estimates regarding penetration of closures and aluminum screwcaps. Our estimates
involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. In addition, certain
information in this Offering Memorandum is not based on published data obtained from independent
third parties, or extrapolations thereof, but consists of information and statements reflecting our best
estimates based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations,
consultants and other contacts within the industries in which we operate, as well as information published
by our competitors. Certain forward-looking statements contained in such industry and market data were
made prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and have not been updated to account for the
impact of such outbreak. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have
been materially different if the COVID-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See also “Risk Factors”,
“Industry Overview” and “Business” for further discussion.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was formed as the result of the merger by incorporation that became effective on August 6,
2018 of pre-merger Guala Closures S.p.A., a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under
the laws of the Republic of Italy on July 26, 2000 (“pre-merger Guala”) into Space4 S.p.A., which was an
Italian special purpose acquisition company, incorporated as a joint stock company (società per azioni)
under the laws of the Republic of Italy on September 19, 2017 (“Space4”). All of the financial information
in this Offering Memorandum is the consolidated financial information of the Issuer as described under
“—Financial Statements” below.

**Financial statements**

We have presented in this Offering Memorandum the historical consolidated financial information
comprising:

   - the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019,
audited by the Independent Auditors, and the auditor’s report thereto (the “2019 Financial
**Statements”);**

   - the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020,
audited by the Independent Auditors, and the auditor’s report thereto (the “2020 Financial
**Statements” and together with the 2019 Financial Statements, the “Audited Financial**
**Statements”); and**

   - the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, including comparative figures as of and for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 (the “Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements” and together with the
Audited Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

The Audited Financial Statements were prepared on the basis of a financial period ending on
December 31 of each relevant year. The Audited Financial Statements are presented in euro and have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.

The Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements were prepared on the basis of three-month period
ending on March 31 of each relevant year, are presented in euro and have been prepared in accordance
with IAS 34. With respect to the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements included herein, the
Independent Auditors have reported that they applied limited procedures in accordance with professional
standards for a review of such information. However, their separate report, included herein, states that
they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on the interim financial information. Accordingly,
the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited
nature of the review procedures applied.

The comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the 2019 Financial
Statements presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have been restated to reflect the
adjustment to the provisional fair values originally recognized in the Issuer’s financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the completion of the purchase price accounting related
to the following business combinations: (i) the Group from the date of the 2018 Acquisition (July 31, 2018)
and (ii) Guala Closures UCP from the date of acquisition (December 12, 2018). The financial effects of
the purchase price accounting included in non-recurring expense related to: (i) the fair value recognition
of inventories at July 31, 2018 and (ii) the gain from the net assets acquired as part of the Guala Closures
UCP business combination compared to the consideration transferred. The financial effects ceased in
2018. See “—Comparability of the Financial Statements—Transactions in 2018” below and note 6.1 to the
2019 Financial Statements for more information.

The comparative figures for the three month period ended March 31, 2020 included in the Unaudited
Condensed Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have been restated to
reflect the adjustment to the provisional fair values originally recognized in the 2020 Unaudited
Condensed Financial Statements related to the completion of the purchase price accounting related to the
acquisition of Closurelogic business. The financial effects ceased in 2020. See note 7.1 to the 2020
Financial Statements for more information.

**_Comparability of the Financial Statements_**

_Transactions in 2018_

On July 31, 2018, the Italian special purpose acquisition company, Space4, acquired a 67% stake in
pre-merger Guala, and GCL International S.à r.l. (a company controlled by Guala) acquired the business
unit (“BU Lux”) of GCL Holdings S.C.A. (pre-merger Guala’s direct parent, 100% shareholder at the time
and management’s investment vehicle “GCL”) that was transferred following a subscription for additional
shares issued by pre-merger Guala by GCL (together with certain other transactions, the “2018 Group
**Reorganization”) to a new indirect subsidiary of pre-merger Guala in connection with the acquisition (the**
“2018 Acquisition”). BU Lux included GCL’s goods, assets, liabilities and legal relationships related to,
among other things, research and development activities, and a portion of the trade receivables and
payables of GCL due from/to pre-merger Guala, other than balances arising from certain intercompany
loans.

On May 7, 2018, Guala Closures International B.V. acquired an investment in GCL International
S.à r.l. and, on May 25, 2018, GCL’s board of directors approved GCL’s transfer of the BU Lux to GCL
International S.à r.l. On July 30, 2018, GCL fully subscribed for and paid in a managers’ capital increase
for €25 million (of which €370,161.40 was allocated to share capital and €24,629,838.60 to share premium
reserve), against the issuance by pre-merger Guala of ordinary shares and management warrants. In
addition, on July 30, 2018, pre-merger Guala’s board of directors resolved to (i) use part of the share
premium reserve created by management’s capital increase to cover the losses carried forward from the
previous financial years which had not already been covered; and (ii) redeem all the participating financial
instruments (“SFP”), by using the SFP reserve and the remaining part of the share premium reserve
created by management’s capital increase. On August 6, 2018, pre-merger Guala merged by incorporation
into Space4 (the “2018 Merger” and together with the 2018 Group Reorganization, the 2018 Acquisition
and other related transactions in connection with the 2018 Merger and the 2018 Acquisition, the “2018
**Business Combination”), which was renamed “Guala Closures S.p.A.” after the 2018 Merger and is the**
Issuer.

On December 12, 2018, through its Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l., the Group
completed the purchase of Scottish company United Closures and Plastics Ltd. (“UCP”) (subsequently
renamed Guala Closures UCP Ltd (“Guala Closures UCP”), that boasts a long-standing presence on the
Scottish market and supplies some historic brands of scotch whisky with which it has long-standing
relationships.

As a result of the above, the Issuer’s income statement and statement of cash flows information for
the year ended December 31, 2018 include seven months of operations of Space 4, prior to the business
combination with pre-merger Guala, and five months of operations of the Group. The financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 was restated to reflect the effects of the
completion of the purchase price accounting related to the following business combinations: (i) the Group
from the date of the 2018 Acquisition (July 31, 2018) and (ii) Guala Closures UCP from the date of
acquisition (December 12, 2018). The financial effects of the purchase price accounting included in
non-recurring expense related to: (i) the fair value recognition of inventories at July 31, 2018 and (ii) the
gain from the net assets acquired as part of the Guala Closures UCP business combination compared to
the consideration transferred. The financial effects ceased in 2018. See note 6.1 to the 2019 Audited
Financial Statements for further information on the 2018 Business Combinations, the Guala Closures UCP
business combination and the purchase price accounting in connection therewith.

Given the impact of the 2018 Business Combinations and the acquisition of Guala Closures UCP, the
income statement and statement of cash flows in our financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 included in the comparative column in the 2019 Financial Statements are not
comparable to the income statement or statement of cash flows for any subsequent period. The financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the comparative column in the 2019
Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum has not been prepared on a pro
forma basis to reflect the results of operations of pre-merger Guala for any period nor was it restated to
give effect to such impact. As a result, such information does not include any financial information for the
seven month period from January 1 to July 31, 2018 (i.e., until the date of the 2018 Business Combination)
for pre-merger Guala and does not provide a complete picture of our business operations as though we
had been operating on the same basis as prior to the 2018 Business Combination or as compared to our
operations in 2019. We, therefore, do not present financial information for the year ended December 31,
2018 under “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data” nor do we include a

xii


-----

discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 under “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For more information, see the_
2019 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Acquisitions, divestments and other transactions_

During the periods under review, we completed several acquisitions, divestments and other
transactions of assets and companies through which we changed the size of our operations and which
enabled us to expand into new geographical markets and product markets. In general, such transactions
impact the comparability of our results of operations from period to period. As a result, our consolidated
financial information may not be comparable following the date of such acquisitions or divestments. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors affecting
_comparability of operations—Acquisitions, divestments and other transactions affecting our scope of_
_consolidation and comparability of our results of operations”._

_Changes to Accounting Standards_

We made certain changes to accounting standards during the periods under review. Below we
describe changes that had significant impacts on our Financial Statements during these periods. Other
amendments did not have a significant impact in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect
the current or future periods. See notes 2(c) “Changes in accounting standards” to each of the Financial
Statements for further information on accounting policies adopted during the relevant period.

_Application of IFRS 16_

The International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 16 (Leases) in January 2016. The Issuer
has applied IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single lease accounting model for
lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease
liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The accounting model for lessors has not
changed substantially from the IAS 17 model.

The Issuer has elected to apply the modified retrospective approach whereby the financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not adjusted and no first time adoption
(“FTA”) effects were recognized in the reserves at January 1, 2019. Therefore, the comparative figures for
2018 included in the 2019 Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 17 on the same basis
with those reported in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018.

Prior to application of IFRS 16, the Issuer determined whether a contract was, or contained, a lease at
the inception date in accordance with IFRIC 4 (Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease).
The Issuer now determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on the new definition of
IFRS 16. Specifically, the new standard establishes that a contract is or contains a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration.

The Group has recognized new assets and liabilities for its operating leases (as per the definition of
IAS 17) of land, warehouse and factory facilities, production lines, vehicles used within the facilities and IT
hardware. Following the application of IFRS 16, the nature of expenses related to those leases has changed
because the Group recognizes a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease
liabilities and no longer accounts for lease payments. Previously, the Group recognized operating lease
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the
extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized.
Short-term leases (i.e., with a term of less than 12 months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of
low value, which have been excluded from the scope of IFRS 16 as per the practical expedient, are
recognized as operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

For further information on the application of IFRS 16 and its impact on our financial information, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting
_the Comparability of Operations” and note 2(c) to the 2019 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum.

_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_

A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after April 1, 2021. The Issuer
has not early adopted the new or amended standards given the expectation that they will not have a
significant impact on the annual financial statements. For further Recent Accounting Pronouncements,
please see note 3 of the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

**_Breakdown of Financial Information_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial information that is on the basis of
geographic distribution of our net revenue. This information is based on the geographical location of the
subsidiary of the Group that records the revenue rather than the location of the customer. We report the
geographical distribution of our net revenue per country and on a monthly basis. In this Offering
Memorandum, we also present certain financial information by four product lines: Safety closures, Luxury
closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine closures. This information is based on the type of product
sold. In addition, in this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial information by four
destination markets: Spirits, Wine, Water and Beverages, and Oil and Condiments. This information is
based on the markets where our customers’ end-products are sold.

**Other Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain non-IFRS measures, including EBIT, EBITDA,
Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.

   - We define EBIT as profit (loss) before taxation and financial income and expenses.

   - We define EBITDA as profit (loss) before taxation, financial income and expenses and
depreciation and amortization.

   - We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT as adjusted to remove the effects of certain non-recurring and
non-core income and charges.

  - We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as adjusted to remove the effects of certain
non-recurring and non-core income and charges.

  - We define EBIT margin as EBIT divided by net revenue and expressed as a percentage.

  - We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue and expressed
as a percentage.

We believe that EBIT and EBITDA are useful indicators of our ability to incur and service our
indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us.
We believe that Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant measures for assessing our
performance because they are adjusted for certain items which, we believe, are not indicative of our
underlying operating performance and thus aid in an understanding of our Profit and EBIT.

EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are used by different
companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those
companies. You should exercise caution in comparing EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted
EBITDA as reported by us to EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA of other
companies. EBITDA as presented here differs from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” contained
in the Indenture as described under the caption “Description of the Notes”, or for the purposes of any of
our other indebtedness. The information presented by both EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted
EBITDA is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting
standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the
reporting requirements of the SEC. Compliance with the SEC’s requirements would require us to make
changes to the presentation of this information.

None of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement of performance
under IFRS and you should not consider EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT or Adjusted EBITDA as an
alternative to net income determined in accordance with IFRS, as the case may be, or to cash flows from
operations, investing activities or financing activities. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted
EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these
limitations are:

   - the do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

xiv


-----

   - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any
cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

  - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and

  - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and
Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures.

Group and are not recognized measures under IFRS. Although the Group does not believe that these
measures are a substitute for IFRS measures in light of the significant translation effects of movements in
exchange rates due to the international nature of the Group’s business, the Group believes that computing
Net revenue, EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA results for any given period at constant exchange
rates is the most appropriate means to compare the Group’s current results of operations against the
previous year. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for an analysis of the Group’s operating results as reported under IFRS.

We also present the non-IFRS measures of Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth
Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure,
Adjusted cash conversion ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt.

   - We define Net Working Capital as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables.

   - We define Net Capital Expenditure as Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets less Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;

   - We define Growth Capital Expenditure as Net Capital Expenditure related to discretionary
investments to expand our geographical footprint or increase our manufacturing capacity and
capabilities and cost savings and efficiency projects to optimize our operations, equipment and
footprint. Growth Capital Expenditure also includes certain discretionary investments in the design,
development and production of solutions with embedded NFC technologies;

   - We define Maintenance Capital Expenditure as Net Capital Expenditure related to critical ordinary
course investments in tangible and fixed assets to ensure the continuing operation of our asset base;

   - We define EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure as Net Capital Expenditure related to
applicable EHS laws and regulations and sustainability;

   - We define Senior Secured Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes excluding any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility, and Net Senior Secured Debt as Senior Secured Debt as adjusted to give effect to the
Refinancing less cash and cash equivalents; and

xv


-----

   - We define Total Financial Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes, leases under IFRS 16 and other indebtedness under certain bank
facilities (see “Capitalization”), excluding financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants and
the put options in respect of the non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries in Ukraine, Poland,
Bulgaria and Belarus. Total Financial Debt excludes any amounts outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility. We define Net Financial Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as Total
Financial Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing less cash and cash equivalents as
adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing.

We use Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance
Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure and Adjusted Cash Conversion Ratio to
monitor cash flow generation. Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital
Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted
cash conversion ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt are not measures of liquidity
under IFRS or U.S. GAAP and have limitations as an analytical tool, some of which include:

   - They do not deduct cash flows used in other financing activities; and

   - They do not deduct certain other items settled in cash.

Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital
Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted Cash Conversion Ratio, Net Senior
Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available
to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our
obligations. Other companies in the industries in which we operate may calculate Net Working Capital,
Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and
Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted Cash Conversion Ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net
Financial Debt, or other similarly titled measures differently than us, limiting their usefulness as a
comparative measure.

**_Financial Information for the Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2021_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have also presented certain unaudited financial information for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021, which is calculated by taking the results of operations of the Issuer
for the three months ended March 31, 2021, adding it to the results of operations for the full year ended
December 31, 2020, and subtracting the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

represent what the Issuer’s indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Refinancing
occurred on March 31, 2021 or April 1, 2020, respectively, nor does it purport to project the Issuer’s
indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial information as of and for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021 has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, the requirements of

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary highlights selected information from this Offering Memorandum. It is not complete_
_and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. You should_
_read this Offering Memorandum carefully in its entirety, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”,_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry_
_Overview” and “Business”, as well as our Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum._

**Overview**

We believe that we are the world’s leading producer of high value added closures for the spirits and
wine industry. Through ongoing development and technological innovation, we believe that we are the top
producer of non-refillable safety closures for the spirits industry with a market share by volume of units
sold worldwide of more than 60%, the leading global producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures
with a market share by volume of units sold of approximately 30%, and Europe’s largest producer of
roll-on aluminum closures for wine, spirits and olive oil, in each case, in 2019. In aggregate, as of March 31,
2021, we operated from 30 production facilities, five research and development centers and three sales
centers across 25 countries in five continents, and we produced and sold approximately 17 billion closures
across than 300 models and in more than 100 countries in 2020.

Our product lines include: Safety closures, Luxury closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine
closures. We serve customers in several geographies and across four key end-markets: Spirits, Wine, Water
and Beverages, and Oil and Condiments.

The following charts illustrate the breakdown of our net revenue for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2021 by product line, geography based on the geographical location of the subsidiary of the
Group that records the revenue, and end-market.

We believe that our global footprint and technologically advanced facilities, blue-chip customer base,
technology and innovation and effective cost control provide us with a competitive advantage over other
closures producers and make it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete in the
markets in which we sell our products. Our position is further consolidated by our extensive intellectual
property (“IP”) portfolio, with, as of March 31, 2021, over 170 active patents and other IP rights related to
the design and manufacture of closures, and continuous product innovation (over 35 new products have
been launched over the last three years).

We are the leading producer of safety closures by volume of units sold in a number of countries,
including Colombia, India, United Mexican States (“Mexico”) and Ukraine. Notably, safety, closures are
primarily used in emerging markets where there is a high risk of counterfeiting of alcohol. In addition, we
are the leading manufacturer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures in Argentina, Australia, New
Zealand, Poland (from where we serve the European market) and South Africa.

We have a wide customer portfolio, which includes blue-chip major international and regional brands
with whom we have built long-term relationships lasting more than 30 years in certain cases. We supply the
top 10 premium spirits brands worldwide, including McDowell’s, Johnnie Walker, Bacardi, Jack Daniel’s
and Absolut. The breadth and diversity of our customer base results in no single brand accounting for
more than 3% of our net revenue during the last three years.

Over the past decade, we have developed a strong focus on sustainability and ESG issues and strived
to reduce the impact of our products and operations on the environment and climate change. We have
made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and continuously focus, together with
selected partners, on the study, prototyping and development of closures made of materials with a low
environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and recycled polymers as well as
biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials represented 27% of the raw materials
used in our products. In November 2020, we launched a new range of sustainable products under the
umbrella brand Blossom[™] and in December 2020, we signed an exclusivity agreement with Oceanworks[®],
the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, in order to develop a line of T-bar closures
manufactured using fully recycled ocean-diverted plastic. We are committed to reducing the impact of our
operations and wider value chain on the environment by reducing waste, increasing energy and water
savings and using renewable energy, which is well-aligned with our focus on staying at the forefront of
product innovation. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per
ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016. With plants and offices in 25 countries
and customers from over 100 countries, we also place great importance on diversity and inclusion as well as
talent recruitment and management. As of March 31, 2021, the percentage of women holding leadership
positions was 20.0% compared to 15.9% in 2018. In addition, following the appointment of the new board
of directors on April 30, 2021, 44% of the members of our board of directors are women.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we generated net revenue of €564.4 million, loss of
€0.2 million, EBIT of €31.5 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of €98.2 million, resulting in an Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 17.4%. We believe that our high margins are supported by our raw material cost
management and our ability to manage raw material price fluctuations, global diversity and exposure to
growth markets and ongoing management initiatives to improve production efficiencies.

**Our product lines**

We primarily focus on producing a wide variety of specialty and other closures. Our product portfolio
ranges from the simplest screwcaps to the more complex solutions equipped with components made of
different materials with particular aesthetic or safety features.

Our Closures division represents our core business, which is specialized in the following product lines:
Safety closures, Luxury closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine closures. Safety and Luxury
closures feature a higher degree of manufacturing complexity and customization and typically generate
higher margins compared to other closures. Due to their bespoke aesthetic design specific to clients’
brands, Safety and Luxury closures are important components of the marketing strategies of premium
spirits producers and further contribute to their brand awareness and recognition.

decreases the risk of imitation by competitors. Safety closures generally comprise two to 12 different
components that are primarily made out of plastic (with some aluminum mix). Our current product
portfolio comprises over 30 models, all of which can be customized to meet our customer’s requirements
and expectations.

Safety closures are equipped with technologies including tamper-evident systems that enable the
customer to understand if the bottle has been opened, non-refillable systems with internal valves of varying
complexity that prevent bottles to be re-filled, and highly technical structure configurations which make
the separation of safety non-refillable systems from the bottle neck more difficult. Our Safety closures
offering is completed with highly sophisticated smart packaging systems, such as our closures with nearfield communication (“NFC”) technology that use special microchips that are readable by all compatible
smartphones to provide consumers with the certification of product authenticity and other product data.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Safety closures product line generated net revenue
of €202.2 million, representing 35.8% of our net revenue for the period.

**_Luxury closures_**

Our luxury closures give a distinctive character to our customers’ brands and to improve the aesthetic
appeal of their end-products. We estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a global
market share by volume of units of Luxury closures sold of between 6% and 8%.

Our Luxury closures line includes closures made of aluminum, plastic and wood, which are typically
designed to improve the aesthetical appeal and meet the branding needs of high-end spirits that are
produced in small quantities. Luxury closures can be designed to suit different brand and market
requirements, including screw-on, push-on and non-refillable versions with the most advanced decoration
techniques including 3D embossing and metal sputtering.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Luxury closures product line generated net revenue
of €29.3 million, representing 5.2% of our net revenue for the period.

**_Roll-on closures_**

We produce roll-on closures, mainly using aluminum, for spirits, mineral water, vegetable oil and
condiments sectors. We believe that we are the largest producer of standard aluminum Roll-on closures in
Poland, Ukraine and Mexico and the second largest in Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Overall, we estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a market share by volume of units
of Roll-on closures for spirits sold of approximately 15%.

Roll-on closures are primarily made out of aluminum and typically comprise up to four different
components. Our Roll-on closures portfolio ranges from the simplest screwcaps to more customized
solutions decorated with advanced techniques.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Roll-on product line generated net revenue of
€196.4 million, representing 34.8% of our net revenue for the period.

**_Roll-on for wine closures_**

We produce aluminum screwcap closures specifically dedicated to the wine sector that are easy to
open and convenient to store, and have a lower cost than traditional cork closures. We believe that we are
the leading producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures for the wine industry, with a market share
by volume of units sold in 2019 of approximately 30%. The market for aluminum screwcaps for wine
closures continues to grow strongly as a result of the superior performance of aluminum closures
compared to traditional cork closures and as of today screwcaps are embedded in approximately 23% of
the total bottled wines worldwide. We developed one of the widest range of screwcaps for the wine market,
incorporating several specific technical features such as controlled Oxygen Transmission Rate (“OTR”)
liners and decoration techniques such as silk screening, hot-foiling, off-setting, lithography and embossing.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Roll-on for wine closures product line generated
net revenue of €117.1 million, representing 20.8% of our net revenue for the period.

**_Other_**

We include revenue from the sale of PET products, products for the pharmaceutical sector and other
residual amounts that are not otherwise included in the foregoing product lines, under the residual
category “Other”. From the year ended December 31, 2020, our PET revenues are included in Other
revenue as our PET division is no longer considered a core business of the Group following its partial
divestment in 2019.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we generated Other net revenue of €19.4 million,
representing 3.4% of our net revenue for the period.

Following the partial divestment of our PET division and the sale of GCL Pharma S.r.l., which
operated our pharma product line in 2019, we changed the presentation of our segmentation by product.
The following table shows the distribution of our net revenue by product line for the years ended

**Competitive strengths**

We believe we have the following competitive strengths:

**_Market leader in safety closures for spirits and roll-on for wine closures_**

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, in 2019, the global
spirits closures market reached approximately 51 billion of units sold, of which approximately 18 billion
units in our key focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine
and Mexico, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.0% between
2021 and 2024, primarily driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, especially in the
United States and India. According to the same study, Guala’s global addressable Roll-on and Safety
closures markets reached approximately 37 billion units in 2019 (compared to 33 billion in 2016). In
addition, the global market for Roll-on for wine closures reached approximately 32 billion units in 2019


4


-----

(compared to 30 billion units in 2016) and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 2.0% between 2021 and 2024. We believe we are the market leader in the production of
Safety closures for spirits with a market share by volume of units sold worldwide of more than 60%, and
the leading producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures for the wine industry with a market share by
volume of units sold of approximately 30%, in each case in 2019. We estimate that in 2019, our market
shares for Safety and Roll-on for wine closures was six and four times greater than that of our nearest
competitor, respectively. We also believe that we are a leading producer of aluminum closures for spirits in
Europe. We believe that our leadership positions are sustainable due to our commitment to quality,
research and development efforts, proprietary production technologies, long-standing customer
relationships, excellent customer service and brand recognition.

We are a renowned as a key partner in the spirits markets and sell our safety closures to some of the
most prestigious multinational producers of spirits as well as a number of important regional producers in
many of the countries in which we operate. For a spirits producer, packaging and brand are key elements
in product identification and differentiation. Through technological innovation, we offer closures that
enable our customers to better differentiate and position their brands against their competitors. We
believe that the market for safety closures for spirits, including in emerging markets where premium
brands are penetrating further, will continue to grow. See “Industry Overview”. Our safety closures help
global manufacturers of spirits to protect against counterfeiting, particularly in emerging markets where
the risk of counterfeiting is higher. As a result, we believe that we are the leading manufacturer of safety
closures in various emerging countries, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. Both global and
local manufacturers of spirits also use safety and luxury closures to differentiate their brands.

Our aluminum screwcaps for wine closures are designed to facilitate opening and closing the bottle
and feature liners that keep the oxygenation of the wine in check so the wine retains its quality and flavour
longer. In this market, we serve some of the major wine producers as well as a number of important
regional players, such as Casella in New Zealand, Distell in South Africa and The Wine Group in the
United States. We expect that the market for aluminum screwcaps for wine closures will continue to grow
due to the advantages of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures over traditional cork closures. We believe
that we are well placed to benefit from this growth because of our ability to cross-sell to manufacturers
who also sell spirits, our capacity for decoration and design, the economies of scale permitted by our
extensive distribution network and the proximity of several of our plants to “New World” wine producers
in Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.

**_Unique global platform for growth across regions and products due to technologically advanced facilities across_**
**_the world_**

As the only safety closures producer with a global production network, we operated 30 production
facilities and five research and development centers and three sales offices in 25 countries across five
continents as of March 31, 2021.

The strength and global reach of our platform is supported by our decentralized sales structure with a
wide network of local area managers, which enables us to be in close proximity to our key customers
worldwide, allowing us to establish and foster close relationships with industry players across geographies.
We believe our proximity to our customers enhances our ability to respond quickly to changing local
trends. In addition, our global scale enables us to source capacity from different locations based on supply
and demand levels so that we can serve our customers across multiple geographies depending on their
needs and requirements. As a result, we are able to develop new products and value added solutions that
meet the requirements of customers in our key end-markets while limiting our labor costs and creating
production synergies, all of which positions us well for future growth.

Our global platform of technologically advanced facilities is equipped with state-of-the-art
technologies, processing solutions, quality controls and machinery. Over the years, we have developed
proprietary production technologies that are crucial for the manufacture of technologically advanced
closures. As part of our efforts to make our manufacturing process more efficient by leveraging on
technological innovations, we regularly pilot and implement various projects across our manufacturing
facilities, including a multi-injection project in our facility in Colombia to develop closures made of
different plastics in the same mould in order to eliminate the assembly stage of our production process and
provide significant additional anti-counterfeiting protection to our closures. In addition, we focus on widescale flexible automation of our productions processes, which we plan to implement also for small and
medium-sized product batches. As customers increasingly demand more product customization, we believe
that our technologically advanced facilities position us to adapt to this market trend and meet the
increasingly complex specifications of our customers.

**_Long-standing and trusted blue chip customer relationships, high switching costs and diverse customer base_**

Our consistent product quality and customer service have allowed us to develop strong and longstanding relationships with our customers, both in mature and emerging markets. We enhance customer
loyalty through our research and development activities, which are often driven by the specific business
requirements of our customers. We have strong and long-standing relationships with most of the large
global producers of spirits, including Bacardi, Brown Forman, Campari, Diageo and Pernod Ricard, and
we work closely with individual brands owned by these producers. We also serve major wine producers,
such as Accolade, Castel, Caviro and Torres, Concha y Toro, Constellations Brands, Pernod Ricard and
Treasury wines. In addition, we serve a broad range of regional and local producers of spirits and wines
across all of our geographies. In 2020, approximately 30% and 70% of our net revenues was generated
from sales of products to global and regional spirits producers, respectively. We have long-term
relationships with many of our customers, which in some cases exceed 30 years.

Due to the nature of bottle closures, we work in close partnership with leading spirits and wines
producers in the study, prototyping and development of highly innovative closures specifically designed for
their end-products, particularly safety and luxury closures, which often become integral parts of the overall
packaging design featured in their advertising campaigns. For example, we have developed the “Neptune”
closure for the SKYY Vodka brand, the “Florence” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Ballantine’s in both open
pourer and non-refillable versions and the luxury quality “Ultis” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Chivas
Whiskey. In recent years, the trend for customized solutions has resulted in the increase of the share of
products that we co-design and co-develop with our customers, particularly for luxury closures. For
example, we currently co-develop all of the luxury closures with premium spirit brands including, among
others, Macallan, William Grant’s, Haig Club, Dewar’s. The trend for customized solutions has also driven
the co-development of highly customized Safety closures with brands such as Jose Cuervo, Khortitsa and
Russian Standard. At the same time, we continue to develop products that can be sold to all customers in
specific end-markets, particularly in the wine and water closures market.

The high degree integration of our closures with customers’ end-products and the fact that our
closures are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection, makes it more difficult
and costly for our customers to source alternative closures from our competitors. In addition, our longstanding, collaborative relationships with leading brands and our ability to leverage our global platform to
serve their needs across multiple geographies have allowed our closures to be used in our customers’
products globally, often becoming industry standard. In safety closures, we are typically the sole supplier
for a particular brand in a particular region. At the same time, our customer base is largely diversified and,


6


-----

while certain of our customers own multiple brands, no single brand accounted for more than 3% of our
net revenue in 2019 and 2020.

As a result of the time and resources invested in joint product development activities with customers,
we also often receive recognition. For example, the e-closures equipped with NeˇSTGATE[™] NFC
technology that we launched in 2020 with Vigneti Massa, a well-established winemaker located in
Piedmont, Italy, received three prestigious awards in 2019: the Alufoil Trophy, the SIMEI Innovation
Challenge and the WorldStar Award. In addition, in February 2020 we received, together with Vigneti
Massa, a special prize for innovation in the wine sector at the inaugural Food & Wine Italia Awards.

We believe that the multinational scope of our operations and our ability to meet our customers’
quality standards across geographic markets are increasingly important factors to our large global
customers. In addition, our international presence allows us to operate in close physical proximity to our
customers’ production facilities and meet their product and design requirements with greater flexibility
and at a more competitive price and quality than our competitors.

**_Highly differentiated proprietary engineered product portfolio supported by a strong focus on research and_**
**_development_**

We believe that a key reason for our strong positioning in the global markets is the wide range of
products in our portfolio, which we sell to customers operating in four key end-markets: spirits, wine, water
and beverages, and olive oil and condiments. Our safety closures, which are highly engineered packaging
components generally consist of two to 12 different components, range from tamper-evident seals to more
sophisticated non-refillable devices covering the medium to high value added range of the closures market.
Our luxury closures, typically designed for high-end spirits produced in limited quantities, are made of
both aluminum and plastic, are customized according to the requirements of our customers and can
include ribbons, seals and unusual shapes. Our roll-on closures and other product lines provide a range of
products for spirits and mineral water and often provides an entry point for up-selling customers to other
higher value added product lines. Our roll-on for wine closures are made from aluminum and customers
can choose whether or not to include a tamper-evident band for protection against counterfeiting.

In line with our long-term commitment to design sustainable solutions and increasing customer focus
on sustainability in their own products, we recently developed and launched several sustainable solutions,
such as products of our Blossom[™] line, including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum
screwcap made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic
and agglomerated cork that we developed in collaboration with Oceanworks[®], the largest global
marketplace for sustainable materials, and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a
tamper-evident ring produced from completely bio-based polymers.

Our research and development capabilities and our customer service functions enable us to
continuously improve and expand our product offering, including in response to customer feedback, and
the solutions we develop are often proprietary in nature and covered by patents, trade secrets and
know-how, all of which ensures our product portfolio remains differentiated.

**_Focus on innovation, technology and product development_**

We are committed to product research and development and the digitalization of packaging, and we
believe that we are a leading innovator in the closures industry, with a record of developing new and
enhanced products with improved functionality, reliability and sustainability. In addition, the increased
interconnectivity of our closures leads to closer integration between packaging suppliers and customers
during the designing, ordering and delivering phases as closures are closely tailored to customers’ needs.
We focus on the study, prototyping and development of highly engineered innovative solutions together
with selected partners, particularly for safety closures, and we protect our know-how by applying for
patents and other intellectual property protections for our products and processes. As of March 31, 2021,
we held, or had lodged applications for, more than 170 patents, including 113 active patent families,
10 utility model families, 5 combined patents and utility model families and 44 protected industrial designs.
Patents covered approximately 29% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. The
proprietary nature of our products makes it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively
compete with us, as our research and development capabilities allow us to strengthen our relationships
with customers.

-----

We operate five research and development centers in Italy, Scotland, Mexico, Ukraine and
Luxembourg. We believe that our developments allow us to derive a significant competitive advantage in
our markets because more advanced products generally provide us with higher margins. During the last
three years, we have launched over 35 new products. Examples of some of our most recent innovations
include various e-closures with fully integrated NFC capabilities, including our new series of e-closures
under the NeˇSTGATE[™] brand, which we started to develop in 2018, including the first wine bottles
equipped with NFC technology in Europe, which we launched in partnership with Vigneti Massa in 2020,
and e-closures specifically designed for Irish whiskey Jameson, which we launched in 2020. The NFC
technology is revolutionizing conventional bottle packaging by integrating connectivity features into bottle
closures for spirits, wine, olive oil and beverages. In particular, our NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures are equipped
with a special microchip inside the capsule that is readable by all compatible smartphones, without
downloading any specific application, providing consumers with the certification of authenticity and
unlocking all information about the product, directly linking them to the brand and boosting customer
engagement and loyalty. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] product range also comprises various QR code-based as well
as more basic serial number-based models for wine and beverages. Most recently, we designed an
electronic tamper-evident closure equipped with proximity sensors capable of detecting nearby objects in
partnership with NXP Semiconductors, which we plan to launch in the coming months. Following our
recent acquisition of a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services
agency based in London, we are able to offer our customers turnkey solutions, including digital platforms,
integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions.

We also have developed proprietary manufacturing processes that help reduce our operating costs
and improve our profitability. In certain cases, we work with our customers to develop new and more
competitive products. By offering support and by providing the technical expertise and service needed to
develop new products, we have enhanced our relationships with our customers. In addition, in order to
refresh our current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our
research and development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual
brands and equipped with innovative technological and sustainable features and with a sophisticated
design, which we expect to launch between 2021 and 2023.

**_Proven track record of successful acquisitions focused on creating long-term value_**

Over the past two decades, our growth has been complemented through strategically identified
acquisitions and other business combinations and investments, which enabled us to strengthen our market
position and further increase our market share. In doing so, we have increased the number of geographical
markets in which we operate, including Australia, Bulgaria, France, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine,
Belarus, Germany and Turkey and have expanded our presence in new segments and the types of products
which we offer, including aluminum screwcaps for wine closures. Most recently, in 2018, we acquired
United Closures and Plastics (now called Guala Closures UCP), a Scottish company with a long-standing
presence in the Scottish market, which supplies some landmark scotch whisky brands. In 2020, we acquired
Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the
glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we
acquired a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in
London focusing on integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions, which we
increased from 20% to 30% in the first quarter of 2021. We believe that we have been successful at
identifying and integrating acquired companies within the Group and at delivering synergies. Our success
in identifying and integrating acquired companies has contributed to the diversification of our geographic
and product category profile and the maintenance of attractive margins.

**_Best-in-class financial profile with proven resilience, with a decade of strong Adjusted EBITDA margins despite_**
**_foreign exchange rate and raw materials price fluctuations_**

We manage our business with a focus on achieving and maintaining a strong Adjusted EBITDA
margin as compared to those of our industry peers. We have a strong track-record of more than a decade
of revenue growth and stability of Adjusted EBITDA margins within a very narrow and consistent range.
We believe our business is resilient against the impact of adverse foreign exchange movements and raw
materials price fluctuations. Furthermore, we believe that the diversified nature of our end-markets and
customer base, coupled with our global presence have allowed us to maintain strong performance in 2020


8


-----

despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are supported
by hedging arrangements covering a portion of our costs for raw materials via forward contracts. From
time to time, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are impacted by the initial dilutive effect of strategic
acquisitions; however, we strive to support our acquired businesses in order to maintain high group-wide
margins as we strive to achieve industry leading profitability. As a result, we believe our average Adjusted
EBITDA margin from 2015 to 2020 (including pre-merger Guala) was one of the three highest among our
direct competitors within the industry.

Our profit/(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2021, represented 2.4%, (1.0)% and (0.0%), respectively, of our net revenue. We have achieved
strong Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.7%, 17.1% and 17.4% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, and in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. We were able to achieve these results
leveraging both organic and inorganic growth, in spite of the fluctuations in exchange rates and raw
material prices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the economic recovery starting in
the third and fourth quarter of 2020, our sales volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, while
our net revenue in 2020 decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019,
our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to
€603.8 million from €606.5 million in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, our overall sales volumes continued
to improve despite the loss of volumes from sales in the European water and beverage market, which was
negatively impacted by the restrictions implemented in the hotel, restaurant and catering (“HORECA”)
industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, while net revenue decreased by €7.6 million, or
5.2%, from €145.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €138.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the first quarter of 2021
increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9%, from €145.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 to €147.2 million. Our
resilient industry leading margins coupled disciplined approach to working capital and capital expenditure
led to a strong Adjusted cash conversion ratio of 88% in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020. The above information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations”._

**_Strong focus on ESG and sustainability by pursuing ambitious targets_**

Over the past decade, we have developed a strong focus on sustainability and ESG issues and
strived to reduce the impact of our products and operations on the environment and climate change.
Going forward, we intend to continue to focus on sustainability and ESG and have developed a
comprehensive strategy to optimize sustainability across our operations and identified a series of
sustainability targets. We have made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and
have been, together with selected partners, studying, prototyping and developing closures made of
materials with a low environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and
recycled polymers as well as biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials
represented 27% of the raw materials used in our products and we intend to increase this percentage to
35% by the end of 2025. Our product portfolio already comprises several sustainable products under the
umbrella brand Blossom[™], including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap
made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and
Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from
completely bio-based polymers. In line with our long-term commitment on sustainability, we intend to
increase the share of environmentally-friendly solutions in our portfolio, by extending our existing range
of sustainable closures and developing new solutions.

In order to protect the environment, meet sustainability needs and contribute to the mitigation of the
effects of climate change, we focus on minimizing environmental pollution, reducing waste, increasing
energy and water savings and using renewable energy. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope
1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016,
and we intend to decrease such emissions further by optimizing processes and optimizing loads and
logistics across our supply chain. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, we implemented “Iris”, a new
software developed entirely in-house, at our Spinetta Marengo facility in Italy, which is able to connect
150 pieces of machinery simultaneously, perform data analysis and make recommendations to the facility’s
operator in line with our key sustainability principles. Going forward, we plan to implement Iris at all our
facilities worldwide.

**_Experienced and committed management team supported by clear and simple reporting lines and a decentralized_**
**_sales structure_**

We benefit from the experience of our key management who each have decades of experience in the
closures and packaging industry. In addition, in 2021 we welcomed our new Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. Gabriele del Torchio, who brings a wealth of experience in running high profile businesses and a track
record of approximately 45 years in managing industrial companies. Management has consistently
demonstrated its ability to develop our business by anticipating market trends and dynamics, creating
significant added value for customers and entering new geographies and product markets, underpinned by
clear and simple reporting lines directly to the Chief Operating Officer, who is supported by two regional
managers for the Americas and the Asia Pacific region, and by decentralized local sale structure with a
strong network of area managers responsible for day-to-day relationships with local customers. Our
effective management structure has also allowed us to take swift action in response to the weak global
economic environment in past years, including headcount reductions, temporary plant shutdowns and exits
from non-core markets, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, management has
continued to implement cost reduction measures and to improve cash flow management while pursuing
our strategy to enter new geographies and product markets through organic growth and by acquiring and
successfully integrating companies already operating in our industry.

**Business strategy**

We aim to maintain our market leadership as a large-scale producer of specialty closures and to
continue growing our business while enhancing our profitability by growing our revenue, reducing our cost
base and expanding our product portfolio. Our strategy to achieve these objectives includes the following
key elements:

**_Continue to invest in product development and digitalization and cross-sell or up-sell high end products to existing_**
**_customers_**

Competition in our key market segments is focused mainly on product quality, innovation,
digitalization, sustainability and customer service. As a result, we believe that developing reliable products
with innovative functional features, aesthetic appeal and other improvements are necessary for enhancing
demand for our products. We plan to continue improving our product offering technologically and
innovatively by developing new ranges of safety closures that offer varying degrees of protection against
counterfeiting while promoting our customers’ brand images worldwide. In particular, we plan to continue
to focus on the digitalization of our closures by offering more products equipped with innovative
technological features, such as NFC microchips and quick response (“QR”) code-based solutions. We will
continue to work closely with our customers to develop new and more innovative solutions and we believe
that the increasing digitalization of closures will lead to even closer integration with our customers’
end-products and will position us for further growth. In addition, we intend to develop new aesthetically
appealing styles to complement existing products and meet the growing marketing requirements of our
customers. We also intend to encourage customers of our roll-on closures to upgrade and convert to more
sophisticated, aesthetic, luxurious and protective safety closures where appropriate. In order to refresh our
current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our research and
development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual brands and
equipped with innovative technological and sustainable solutions and with a sophisticated design, which we
expect to launch between 2021 and 2023.

**_Increase sales of premium products through a focus on safety and luxury closures across different geographies_**

In recent years, we have expanded our global presence and we believe we are the leading producer of
safety closures by volume in several emerging markets, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. In
2019, we started our operations in Africa following the inauguration of Guala Closures East Africa’s new
facility in Kenya and opened a new facility in Belarus. In 2020, we entered the Turkish market following
our acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH and its assets in Turkey. We intend to continue our geographical
expansion by consolidating our presence in these and other markets, with a particular focus on specialty
closures for the spirits market, including added-value safety and luxury closures.

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the global spirits
closures market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% between 2016 and


10


-----

2019, reaching approximately 37 billion closures in 2019, of which approximately 18 billion units in our key
focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine and Mexico.
According to this study, the market for safety closures represented approximately 38% of the global spirits
closures market in 2019, while 42% was represented by roll-on closures. Despite the negative impact from
the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a 9% decrease in the size of the spirits closures market in our
key focus regions in 2020, a strong rebound is expected in 2021, with a full recovery predicted to occur
between 2021 and 2022, on a country-by-country basis. In particular, it is expected that the global spirits
closures market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.5% between 2021 and
2024, mainly driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, which are expected to grow at a
compound annual growth rate of approximately 4% and 5%, respectively, between 2021 and 2024.

We expect significant growth for the specialty closures segments in emerging markets. In recent years,
these markets have experienced an increase in the consumption of branded spirits. We believe this has
resulted in a greater demand for sophisticated anti-counterfeiting systems (such as our non-refillable safety
closures) by the producers of such spirits and we expect such demand to continue to grow. In addition,
producers are increasingly using safety closures as a marketing tool to create a premium brand image
through the use of exclusive packaging.

We believe that our leading position means that we are well placed to benefit from the expected
future growth in the safety closures market worldwide, including in emerging markets. We aim to take
advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence in these markets. We intend to achieve
this by strengthening our relationships with drinks producers and consolidating our presence and
infrastructure in the relevant countries.

**_Position the Group to benefit from expected growth in the market for wine closures and bottled water_**

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the aluminum
screwcaps for wine closures market grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% between
2016 and 2019, as a result of evolving consumer habits and the ability of screwcaps to preserve product
quality while having a low incidence on the price and costs of packaging. The screwcap market has also
demonstrated a higher resiliency to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the
overall closures market, showing a strong rebound in 2021 to date, which we expect will continue, and an
expected growth at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% between 2021 and 2024. We
believe that aluminum winecaps today account for approximately 23% of all bottled wine worldwide and
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth in this industry, especially as large
regions such as North America and Europe move towards greater usage of aluminum winecaps.

We believe we are one of the top producers of aluminum winecap closures, with a market share by
volume of units sold in 2019 of approximately 30%. We expect growth in the wine closures market to
continue due to increasing end-consumer preference for aluminum closures rather than cork. We believe
that our leading position in this market means we are well placed to benefit from this growth. We aim to
take advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence this end-market, by strengthening our
relationships with wine producers, particularly those which are also active in the spirits market, by
developing new and aesthetically attractive closures, including closures with safety elements and innovative
features, and by consolidating our operations in the countries and regions where wine closures are
purchased in large volumes.

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the market for
closures for bottled water, measured by closures unit, grew at a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 5% between 2015 and 2019, and is expected to grow further a compound annual growth rate
of approximately 6% between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by growth in population and increased shift
towards healthier beverages. In particular, the premium market for glass water bottles is expected to grow
at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7% over the same timeframe. We believe we are
currently recognized as a key closure producer in the premium market for glass water bottles, particularly
following our acquisition of Closurelogic, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures
mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, in 2020. Going forward, we intend
to take advantage of these strong growth trends in the glass-bottle closures market by leveraging our core
business technology in metal screw caps for spirit closures as well as our expertise in tamper-evident
systems.

**_Carry out further selected acquisitions in core and adjacent markets_**

During the last 10 years, we have grown both organically and through strategically identified
acquisitions. In doing so we have increased the number of geographical markets in which we operate (for
example, we established our presence in Australia, Bulgaria, France, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine,
Belarus, Germany and Turkey) and expanded our presence in new segments and the types of products
which we offer. More recently, in 2018, we acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a
long-standing presence in the Scottish market, and in 2020, we acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German
manufacturer specialising in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral
water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we also acquired a minority stake in
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London focusing on
integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions. In the first quarter of 2021, we
increased our stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. from 20% to 30%. We believe that we have been
successful at identifying and integrating acquired companies and at exploiting the synergies offered by such
acquisitions. Going forward, we intend to continue to identify appropriate expansion opportunities where
we consider it would help us grow in new geographical markets with high levels of alcohol consumption
that we view as underpenetrated including, for example, South Africa and certain countries in Asia. In
addition, we intend to continue to identify appropriate acquisitions and other development opportunities
that would allow us to consolidate our position in the market for aluminum and plastics closures, and
diversify our business through the expansion in the market for closures made of alternative materials such
as cork as well as in adjacent product markets, such as food and beverages, including water, beauty and the
pharmaceutical industries.

**_Further improve operational efficiency by optimizing manufacturing and the supply chain_**

The optimization and automation of our manufacturing processes and the investment in new
equipment for our technologically advanced plants is one of our core areas of focus and going forward we
expect to continue to invest in innovative technologies for supply chain management in order to optimize
our production and supply chain network efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of our production
processes, we aim to (i) modernize and automate our production processes on a wide-scale through our
flexible automation project, including for small and medium-sized product batches, which we believe will
enable us to respond promptly to evolving market needs; (ii) continue to advance our production processes
by implementing systems to monitor and improve our entire production cycles (the “continuous
improvement” program) and our multi-injection project aimed at eliminating the assembly stage of the
manufacturing process; and (iii) hedge part of the risks of price fluctuation in the purchase price of
aluminum through forward purchases on the London Metal Exchange through the use of hedging
depending on the commodity price environment. We endeavor to leverage key focus platforms across the
Group and improve profitability of selected sites opportunistically.

**_Continue prudent financial management, focusing on liquidity, deleveraging, Net Working Capital and hedging of_**
**_raw materials_**

We believe that the Group has benefited from prudent financial management throughout its history,
with a particular focus on cost reduction and cash flow management. We intend to use our cash flow
generation capacity, and our Revolving Credit Facility, to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity and Net
Working Capital in order to enable us to respond to unexpected changes in economic conditions. We will
continue to monitor our capital expenditures carefully in order to benefit from favorable economic
conditions and be able to take advantage of opportunities for acquisitions, and to continue to implement
the Group’s strategy, particularly in emerging markets. We will also continue to carefully monitor
fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, both aluminum and plastics, and changes in prevailing currency
exchange rates. We intend to manage raw material price fluctuations by hedging our exposures where
appropriate as well as currency fluctuations by matching revenue to expenditure in each currency where
possible.

(the “Adherence Agreement”), pursuant to which Space Holding S.r.l. undertook (also for its partners) to
tender 3,656,250 ordinary shares (equal to 5.2% of the fully diluted share capital of the Issuer and 4.6% of
the fully diluted voting rights exercisable in shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer) in the Mandatory Offer
(as defined below).

On March 25, 2021, SPSI announced the launch of a mandatory tender offer on the ordinary shares of
the Issuer (the “Mandatory Offer”) as it had met the relevant legal conditions pursuant to Articles 102 and
106 of Italian legislative decree n. 58 of February 24, 1998 (the “Italian Financial Act”) by holding a total
amount of 33,493,940 ordinary shares representing 49.9% of the Issuer’s share capital, and 44.6% of the
voting rights exercisable at the shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer, equivalent to 47.8% of the fully diluted
share capital of the Issuer and 42.6% of the fully diluted voting rights exercisable at the shareholders’
meeting of the Issuer.

On May 8, 2021, SPSI published the offer document (“Offer Document”), which was approved by
CONSOB on May 6, 2021. The Mandatory Offer was then launched in respect of all of the ordinary shares
of the Issuer net of the 33,493,940 ordinary shares already held by SPSI, consisting of 32,212,276 ordinary
shares, representing 46.0% of the fully diluted share capital of the Issuer and 40.9% of the fully diluted
voting rights exercisable at the shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer. In addition, following conversion of
4,322,438 Class B special shares into ordinary shares during the Offer Period (as defined below), the
Mandatory Offer was increased to up to 36,534,714 ordinary shares, representing 52.2% of the share
capital of the Issuer and the fully diluted voting rights exercisable at the shareholders’ meeting of the
Issuer.

SPSI also announced the launch a voluntary tender offer (the “Voluntary Offer” and, together with
the Mandatory Offer, the “Offers”), pursuant to Article 102 of the Italian Financial Act, in respect of the
warrants (named the “Market Warrant Guala Closures S.p.A.”) (the “Market Warrants”), listed on the
Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato Telematico Azioniario) net of the 6,769,340 Market Warrants already held
by SPSI, consisting of 12,598,053 Market Warrants.

The Offers remained open from May 18, 2021 until June 7, 2021 (the “Offer Period”) and settled on
June 14, 2021. SPSI paid €8.20 per ordinary share tendered in the Mandatory Offer and €0.30 per Market
Warrant tendered in the Voluntary Offer. Following completion of the Mandatory Offer on June 14, 2021,
SPSI held a total amount of 66.478.903 ordinary shares representing 94.9% of the Issuer’s share capital
and voting rights. In addition, following completion of the Voluntary Offer, SPSI held 16.809.156 Market
Warrants, representing 86.8% of the Issuer’s total Market Warrants.

**_The Sell-Out, Squeeze-Out and Delisting_**

As a result of SPSI holding more than 90% and less than 95% of Guala’s share capital, pursuant to
Article 108, paragraph 2 of the Italian Finance Law and taking into account that the purpose of the
Mandatory Offer was to achieve the Delisting of Guala, on June 11, 2021, SPSI announced that it would
purchase shares from any minority shareholders at a price of €8.20 per ordinary share tendered making a
request to such effect (the “Sell-Out”). The Sell-Out commenced on June 18, 2021 and will be completed
on July 8, 2021. If, as a result of the Sell-Out, SPSI comes to own at least 95% of the share capital of
Guala, SPSI will then exercise its right to purchase from minority shareholders all of their residual shares
in Guala (the “Squeeze-Out”) pursuant to Article 111, paragraph 1 of the Italian Finance Law. Following
completion of the Sell-Out, Guala’s ordinary shares and Market Warrants will be delisted from the
_Mercato Telematico Azionario organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (the “Delisting”). Upon_
completion of the Sell-Out and the Delisting, the Market Warrants will no longer be exercisable by their
respective holders, except in case of re-listing of the Issuer’s ordinary shares on the Italian Stock Exchange
(Mercato Telematico Azioniario).

**_The Refinancing_**

As a result of the Offers, the results of which were announced by SPSI on June 7, 2021, the change of
control provision in our Existing Notes was triggered and the Issuer will be required in accordance with the


13


-----

provisions of the indenture governing the Existing Notes to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes
to repurchase any or all of their Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal

Issuer elects to redeem all of the outstanding Existing Notes at par prior to the date on which the Issuer is
required to make such an offer. There is committed financing in place in order to fund the redemption, if
required. The Issuer intends to redeem the Existing Notes in full using a portion of the proceeds from the
Offering.

In addition, the change of control provision in our Existing Revolving Credit Facility was triggered
and lenders representing €67 million of commitments thereunder have agreed to waive their right to
request the full repayment of outstanding amounts and cancel their commitments thereunder. On April 26,
2021, we cancelled €13 million of commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and repaid
€2.7 million of outstanding amounts thereunder that were owed to lenders that did not waive their right to
request the repayment of outstanding amounts thereunder. We also made a repayment of €0.35 million on
May 24, 2021 and a repayment of €0.25 million on June 7, 2021. As a result of the above, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility has a total aggregate amount of
€67 million and an aggregate principal amount outstanding of €13.6 million.

We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the Offering to redeem the Existing Notes and pay
accrued interest thereon, and repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. See
also “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization”. In connection with the Transactions, we will cancel the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility, including any accrued
and unpaid interest thereon. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility”.

**Sources and Uses of Proceeds**

The gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be €500.0 million and will be used to redeem the

**Recent Developments**

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

Our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended
March 31, 2021 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the outbreak of the pandemic in
March 2020, we promptly undertook all actions necessary to minimize the social and occupational health
and safety and financial impacts of the pandemic by defining and implementing flexible and timely action
plans. Among other things, we invested in personal protective equipment and implemented a series of
social distancing, cleaning and other health and safety measures to ensure the safety of the employees at
our production facilities. At the same time, we successfully transitioned a portion of our corporate
employees to remote working over a short period of time. To manage our cost structure, reduce our use of
cash and further preserve our liquidity position during the pandemic, we implemented several COVID-19
crisis management initiatives including, among others, the reduction of temporary workers and other
short-term cost reduction measures such as the reduction of marketing and travel expenses, which limited


15


-----

the negative impact on our profit margins. At the same time, we focused on reducing our personnel
expense, including by placing certain employees on temporary furlough schemes, and took advantage of
government support programs, including salary subsidies, in the United Kingdom and in countries across
Europe, such as Italy and Spain. We also benefited from certain changes in tax rules introduced as a result
of COVID-19 in most of our countries of operations, such as deferrals of certain tax payments and
temporary reductions in social contribution payments. Since we manufacture some of our products for
customers in the food and beverage industry, which is considered essential and ensures the continued
supply of basic necessities, our supply chain, including raw materials supply and logistics, has generally not
been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our manufacturing plants were fully or partially
exempted from business closure and lockdown orders in most of our countries of operations. As a result,
despite a temporary halt of all or part of the operations at our facilities in certain countries, particularly in
Asia, in certain South American countries and in South Africa during the first phase of the pandemic, we
were able to maintain operations, at different degrees of capacity and for certain production lines, at most
of our facilities in Europe and the Americas. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Position and Results of Operations— Principal factors affecting our results of operations—General_
_macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”._

The restrictions and business closures implemented in our countries of operations in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business marginally in the first quarter of 2020 and more significantly
during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted in lower sales volumes, particularly in the spirits
end-markets. However, the various measures we implemented in the response to the pandemic and our
focus on making our business more resilient and sustainable, coupled with the diversified nature of our
end-markets and customer base and our global presence, have allowed us to maintain strong performance
in 2020. Following the economic recovery starting in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we were able to
benefit from the gradual lifting of various restrictions on the HORECA industries as well as the tourism
sector, and our sales volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, while our net revenue in 2020
decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019, our Net Revenue at
Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to €603.8 million from
€606.5 million in 2019. While for the year ended December 31, 2019, we reported a profit of €14.7 million,
for the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a loss of €5.9 million. In addition, while our Adjusted
EBITDA in 2020 decreased by €15.6 million, or 13.7%, to €98.0 million from €113.5 million in 2019, our
Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by €9.3 million, or 8.2%, compared to
2019. We estimate that in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in volumes that
negatively impacted our net revenue for the period by approximately €42 million. We estimate that this
reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 by approximately
€15 million.

In the first three months of 2021, many governments across the world re-introduced restrictive
measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans and mandatory social
distancing for both individuals and businesses, as well as required closures of non-essential businesses,
particularly in the HORECA industries as well as the travel sector. Although we and our suppliers and
customers have implemented appropriate measures under these restrictions, we believe that the
restrictions currently in place have not had the same adverse impact on our business as those restrictions
implemented in connection with the first wave of the pandemic in the first and second quarter of 2020. In
the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the
HORECA industries had a significant negative effect on the European water and beverage sector
(particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany), which heavily relies on on-premises consumption, and we
estimate that this resulted in a reduction in volumes compared to the same period in 2020, which adversely
impacted our net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 by approximately €8 million. We estimate that this
reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted EBITDA by approximately
€1 million in the first quarter of 2021. However, this reduction in volumes in the first quarter of 2021 was
more than offset by increased sales volumes generated outside of Europe, particularly in the Americas,
where revenues grew steadily in the spirits and wine markets, and in Asia, where revenues grew despite the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes outside of Europe also benefitted from customers
increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises channels such as
supermarkets and e-commerce. As a result, while our net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 decreased by
€7.6 million, or 5.2%, to €138.3 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020, our Net Revenue
at Constant Exchange Rates for the first quarter of 2021 increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9% to

-----

€147.2 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. While for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, we reported a loss of €6.3 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, we
reported a loss of €0.5 million. In addition, while our Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021
increased by €0.2 million, or 0.8%, to €24.3 million from €24.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, our
Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates for the first quarter of 2021 increased by €2.5 million, or
10.4%, compared to the same period in 2020.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we reported a loss of €0.2 million. Overall, we estimate
that in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in sales
of approximately €48 million and a negative impact on our Adjusted EBITDA of approximately
€15 million. More recently, a resurgence in infections in India during April and May 2021 resulted in the
implementation of new restrictions in the country and the renewed shutdown of one of our facilities, which
is having a negative impact on our sales volumes in the region. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, all of our plants are operational.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving rapidly and we are unable to predict how the outbreak
and related government responses may affect our business in the future. We continue to monitor the
situation to ensure the safety of our employees, react to any operational developments, logistics
disruptions and macroeconomic fluctuations and assess the ongoing impact of developments on our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We expect our operations to continue to
be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for the foreseeable future and will continue to take the necessary
steps to protect our employees and mitigate the risk to our business.

_Our estimates regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are_
_mainly related to estimates of volume loss deriving from (i) the temporary closure of, or temporary decrease in_
_production volumes at, our production facilities, (ii) loss of orders from customers for which we are the_
_exclusive supplier and for products whose destination markets were impacted by the various lock-down_
_measures implemented on a country-by-country basis, (iii) bans on alcohol sales imposed by local authorities_
_and (iv) supply chain issues such as, among others, restrictions on import/export, customs duties and freight._
_These estimates also take into account estimates of increases in sales volume due to (i) higher customer_
_demand for safety stocks in order to avoid possible supply chain issues and (ii) increased sales in certain end-_
_products markets (including the wine and spirits market) through supermarkets as a result of the increase in off-_
_premise consumption. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to calculate the impact_
_of the COVID-19 pandemic on our net revenue and our Adjusted EBITDA are accurate, this presentation is for_
_illustrative purposes only and does not represent the results that we would have achieved had the COVID-19_
_pandemic not occurred (which might have been significantly different from the ones we indicate herein). Neither_
_our independent auditors or any other independent auditors or consultants have audited, reviewed, compiled or_
_performed any procedures with respect to this information and, accordingly, investors are strongly cautioned_
_against undue reliance on this information when evaluating an investment decision. These data are inherently_
_subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of our results of operations_
_for any historical or future period and may not be comparable to our Financial Statements or the other_
_financial information included in this Offering Memorandum._

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an
_adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, which may be_
_material”._

**_Preliminary financial results for the five months ended May 31, 2021_**

On a preliminary basis, for the five months ended May 31, 2021, we estimate our net revenue will be
in the range of €235 million to €245 million as compared to approximately €229 million from the five
months ended May 31, 2020. In addition, we estimate our Adjusted EBITDA for the five months ended
May 31, 2021 will be higher than our Adjusted EBITDA for the corresponding period of 2020.

_This information reflects certain estimates of our management but involves a number of risks and_
_uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those set forth in our estimates and_
_from past results, performance or achievements. Such estimates are based on results that are not for an entire_
_fiscal period and have not been subject to our normal quarter-end closing and review procedures and_
_adjustments. Such results should not be viewed as a substitute for full interim financial statements prepared in_
_accordance with IFRS and reviewed by our auditors. In the course of preparing and finalizing financial_

_statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the preliminary estimates for the five months ended May 31,_
_2021 will be subject to change and we may identify items that will require us to make adjustments to our_
_preliminary estimates described above. For these or other reasons, the actual results for this period may differ_
_materially from these preliminary estimates. In addition, such results do not purport to indicate our results of_
_operations for any future period beyond the five months ended May 31, 2021. The preliminary financial data_
_included in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management. Our_
_independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such_
_unaudited preliminary financial information for the purpose of its inclusion herein and accordingly, they have_
_not expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering_
_Memorandum._

_In light of the foregoing, prospective purchasers of the Notes are strongly cautioned not to place undue_
_reliance on the above estimates and such estimates should not be regarded as an accurate prediction of actual_
_financial results. See “Forward-Looking Statements” “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other_
_Financial Measures” and “Risk Factors”._

Italian Commission for listed companies and the stock exchange), updated as of June 18, 2021. SPSI holds 94.9% of the Issuer’s
share capital and voting rights. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, 86.9% of SPSI’s share capital is held by SPSH and
the remaining 13.1% is held by the Co-investors and Alantra. 92% of SPSH’s share capital is held by Investindustrial. The freefloat represents the remaining percentage of the Issuer’s share capital and voting rights, equal to 5.1%. See “The Transactions”
and “Principal Shareholders” for further information.

(2) On June 14, 2021, SPSI completed the Offers, consisting of (i) the Mandatory Offer on all of the ordinary shares of the Issuer

e 106 of the Italian Financial Act, and (ii) the Voluntary Offer in respect of the Issuer’s Market Warrants listed on the Italian

counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) will receive
the proceeds received in the event of certain distressed disposals
and/or enforcement of the Collateral, in priority to holders of
the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security” and
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for
further information.

_pari passu to the Notes, and the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to grant security over the
Collateral in connection with future issuances of their
indebtedness, including any additional Notes, as permitted

validity and enforceability. For more information, see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

the Trustee will be party, and each Guarantor will upon the date
on which it grants its Notes Guarantee, become party, to the
Intercreditor Agreement, which sets out, among other things,
the relative priorities of their entitlement and certain other
matters relating to the administration of the Notes Guarantees
and security interests. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . All payments paid by or on behalf of the Issuer, any Guarantor
or any surviving entity under or with respect to the Notes or any
guarantee under the Notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding
or deduction is required by law in any “relevant taxing
jurisdiction”, the Issuer, the Guarantors or surviving entity, as
the case may be, will pay such additional amounts as may be
necessary to ensure that the net amount received after such
withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount that
would have been received if such taxes had not been required to
be withheld or deducted, subject to certain exceptions. See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”.

Subject to and as set out in “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”, the Issuer will not be liable to pay any_
additional amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to any
withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be
amended, or supplemented from time to time) or pursuant to
Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as the same
may be amended, or supplemented from time to time) where the
Notes are held by a person resident in a country that does not
allow for satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (as per
the Ministerial Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance

of September 4, 1996 as amended, supplemented and replaced)
or once effective, any other decree that will be issued in the
future under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239 of April 1,
1996) and otherwise in the circumstances as described in
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”.

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . Prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to
redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “make-whole”
premium. At any time on or after June 15, 2024, the Issuer may

In addition, prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem, at its

Optional Redemption for Taxation
Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the
Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of
control”, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash of 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. A change of
control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control”._

Certain Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders
of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of
the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders,
the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption”._

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture will contain covenants that, among other things,
limit the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                     - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                     - make certain other restricted payments;

                      - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                      - impose restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                      - dispose of its assets

the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants”._

Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will
not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws

to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We have
not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes
(including by way of an exchange offer).

Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . . If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue
price by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily defined
de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be
issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax_
_Considerations”) generally will be required to include such OID_
in gross income as ordinary income as it accrues on a constant
yield basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally in
advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID
is attributable and regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See
“Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”._

redeem the Existing Notes and pay accrued interest thereon, to
repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, for
general corporate purposes and to pay fees and expenses
associated with the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds”.

No Established Market for the
Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be new securities for which there is no existing
market. Although the Initial Purchasers have informed us that
they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that
a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

(1) EBIT refers to profit/(loss) before income taxes and financial income and financial expense as shown in our consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. In evaluating EBIT, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBIT is subject to
certain limitations. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other financial measures”. EBIT is not a measurement
of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider EBIT as an alternative to (a) operating income or net
income (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or

(2) We define EBITDA as EBIT before amortization and depreciation as shown in our consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. In evaluating EBITDA, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBITDA is subject to certain limitations. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other financial measures”. EBITDA is not a measurement of performance or
liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to (a) operating income or net income (as
determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and

(3) Adjusted EBIT refers to EBIT as adjusted to remove the effects of certain non-recurring items described in the table in
footnote (3) that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBIT is not a
measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBIT as an alternative to
(a) operating income or net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance,
(b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any
other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles. For more information on
non-recurring and non-core items, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Non-recurring and non-core income and expense”. The_

(4) Adjusted EBITDA refers to profit/(loss) before income taxes, financial income and expense, depreciation and amortization as
further adjusted to remove the effects of certain non-recurring items described in the table below that we do not consider to be
indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of performance or liquidity under
IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to (a) operating income or net income (as determined in
accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing
activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS
or generally accepted accounting principles. For more information on non-recurring and non-core items, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes is subject to a number of risks. Prospective investors should consider carefully_
_the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum prior to making_
_any investment decision with respect to the Notes. Each of the risks discussed below could have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects which, in turn, could have_
_a material adverse effect on the principal amount and interest which investors will receive in respect of the_
_Notes. In addition, each of the risks discussed below could adversely affect the trading or the trading price of the_
_Notes or the rights of investors under the Notes and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their_
_investment._

_Prospective investors should note that the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. We have_
_described only those risks that we currently consider to be material and there may be additional risks and_
_uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, that might also have a_
_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our international operations are subject to various risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

As of March 31, 2021, we operated 30 production facilities, three sales offices and five research and
development centres in 25 countries across five continents, including in the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland,
India, Mexico, Spain, Ukraine, Germany, United States, Canada, Australia, France and South Africa. We
distribute and sell our products in these and other countries. Our international subsidiaries (i.e., those
incorporated outside of Italy) generated 87%, 88% and 88% of our consolidated net revenue in 2019 and
2020, and in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. In the twelve months ended March 31,
2021, 41% of our net revenue was generated by our subsidiaries located outside of Europe.

As part of our business strategy, we will continue to seek to expand our sales and market share in
various international markets, including by acquiring new companies to enable us to expand our product
offering. The economies of some of the countries in which we operate in Asia, Latin America and Africa
differ from the economies of Western Europe and in some cases present a greater risk profile. Many of
these countries have implemented measures aimed at improving the business environment and providing a
stable platform for economic development. However, the political, economic and legal reforms necessary
to complete such a transformation may not be implemented fully or may not be successful, and the
governments of these countries may implement policies, measures, controls or other actions which could
restrict our business operations or harm our financial results. The risks inherent in the countries where we
operate include, but are not limited to:

   - political, social and economic instability;

   - fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations;

   - changes in government policies and regulations, including more stringent regulation on the sale of
alcoholic beverages, the packaging of alcoholic beverages or packaging in general, or in respect of
labor laws;

   - tariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers;

   - varying tax regimes that could harm our results of operations, including withholding and other taxes
on remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries;

   - longer account receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

   - foreign exchange controls or restrictions on profit repatriation;

   - nationalization or expropriation of property without fair compensation;

   - recessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets;

   - the introduction or application of more stringent restrictions on investments;

   - the possibility of natural disaster, war, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or other so social conflicts;

35


-----

   - epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, ineffective and varying responses from local
governments and competent authorities;

   - completion, including unfair competition, in certain markets in which we compete;

   - changes in the interest rate environment; and

   - fluctuations in local economic growth.

We are exposed to these risks in all of our foreign operations to some degree, and such exposure
could be material to our financial condition and results of operations in emerging markets where the
political and legal environment is less stable. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject
to material adverse developments with respect to our international operations, nor can we assure you that
we will be able to develop and implement systems, policies and practices to anticipate these risk before
they arise or to insure effectively against or manage these risks adequately as and when they arise, or that
we will be able to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations without incurring additional
costs or at all. If we are not able to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

**_The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition,_**
**_liquidity, and results of operations, which may be material._**

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global commerce has been far-reaching and will continue
to be disruptive in the near future. In response to COVID-19, many countries around the world, including
where we manufacture and sell our products, implemented a variety of measures to reduce the spread of
the virus, including travel restrictions and bans, social distancing required for both individuals and
businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. These
restrictions have resulted, among other things, in significant disruptions to business operations, supply
chains and customer activity and demand, service cancellations or reductions and other changes. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, these restrictions have also disrupted our supply-chains, decreased customer
demand for some of our products, particularly in the HORECA industries and the tourism sector, required
us to transition a portion of our workforce to working from home and adversely impacted our ability to
arrange for transport of our raw materials and products. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused
significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which
has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment.
As a result, we focused on reducing our personnel expense, including by placing certain employees on
temporary furlough schemes, and took advantage of government support programs, including salary
subsidies, in the United Kingdom and in countries across Europe, such as Italy and Spain. Were a
recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it
may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks of
COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may occur,
their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty
the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or
other measures implemented by national or local authorities.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted demand for our products, particularly in the second
and third quarter of 2020, and we may not be successful in allocating resources to address rapidly shifting
demand among our product lines. The decline in our sales volumes was primarily due to the fact that the
HORECA industries worldwide came under significant pressure as a result of the various restrictions
implemented by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including alcohol sale bans and
travel restrictions which resulted in a drop in consumption of spirits and wines especially in the
on-premises and travel shops/duty free channels in certain geographies) and the related negative effects on
the overall economic conditions in our key geographical markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. While in
the fourth quarter of 2020 demand for our products recovered, this recovery was not sufficient to fully
offset the decline that we experienced during the second and third quarter of 2020, and our total sales
volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 remained below 2019 levels. As a result, we estimate that in
2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in volumes that negatively impacted our net
revenue for the period. We estimate that this reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted
our Adjusted EBITDA in 2020. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions implemented in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the HORECA industries continued to have a significant negative
effect on the European water and beverage sector (particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany), which
heavily relies on on-premises consumption, and we estimate that this resulted in a reduction in volumes

36


-----

compared to the same period in 2020, which adversely impacted our net revenue for the first quarter of
2021. We estimate that this reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted
EBITDA in the first quarter of 2021. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19”.

The COVID-19 pandemic also partly contributed to the decrease in trade receivables from
€104.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to €92.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and €97.2 million as of
March 31, 2021, which, in turn, resulted in a reduction in our use of without-recourse factoring from
€28.2 million as of December 31, 2019 to €26.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and €20.8 million as of
March 31, 2021. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a further decrease in our trade
receivables which, in turn, could negatively impact our ability to use without-recourse factoring
arrangements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs.

More recently, a resurgence in infections in India during April and May 2021 resulted in the
implementation of new restrictions in the country and the renewed shutdown of one of our facilities, which
is having a negative impact on our sales volumes in the region. If the COVID-19 pandemics leads to
continued or renewed shutdowns, including in connection with, or as a consequence of, the worsening of
the recent outbreak India or elsewhere, or if economic disruption from COVID-19 continues, demand for
our products and our net revenue may continue to be negatively affected. The ultimate impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to control the spread of the virus are uncertain and may materially
restrict or hinder our ability to operate our facilities, due to measures we may need to take to assure the
health and safety of our employees, lack of available workforce, disruptions in the supply of key raw
materials and services or restrictions due to governmental actions. In addition, compliance with social
distancing, cleaning and other health and safety measures implemented in response to COVID-19 in the
various countries in which we operate may be burdensome and could result in the incurrence of additional
costs and penalties.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance will
depend on future developments, including the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and further
restrictive actions taken by various governmental authorities in response to new strains of the virus,
termination of government support programs and the timing of recovery of the overall economy, all of
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. While certain governments have initiated vaccination
programs against COVID-19, such programs are progressing slowly in certain countries and there can be
no assurance on if and when the population of those and other countries will be fully immunized, including
as a result of new strains of the virus which may be characterized by higher transmission rates. Therefore, it
remains unclear if or when the pandemic will cease and whether previously-lifted measures to reduce the
spread of COVID-19 may be reinstated.

There can be no assurance that the outbreak of COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or
other contagious diseases will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience
material adverse impacts to our businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s global economic
impact, including any related recession. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our
business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening
many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. For more details on how COVID-19 has
impacted, and may continue to impact, our business, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of
_COVID-19”._

**_Our business is subject to fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials._**

Our costs for raw materials were €239.3 million, or 42%, of our net revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2021. As a result, fluctuations in raw materials prices have a direct impact on our
production costs. The principal raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are aluminum and
plastic resin, which accounted for €110.9 million (46% of total costs for raw materials) and €61.2 million
(25% of total costs for raw materials), respectively, of our raw materials purchases in the year ended
December 31, 2020. On average, 15% of our aluminum costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 and in
the three months ended March 31, 2021 were related to purchases of aluminum ingots on the London
Metal Exchange, both through spot transactions and forward contracts, while the remaining aluminum
costs consist primarily of costs incurred in processing and converting ingots into coil and which are typically
tied to fixed price contracts and incurred with the aim of making the aluminum ready for our production
processes. Volatility in the prices of core aluminum and plastics affects our gross margins and operating
results. Additionally, volatility in the price of aluminum may affect demand for our products by

37

discouraging wine producers from switching to screwcaps by making it more expensive compared to
alternative closures such as cork and synthetic cork. Plastic resins are subject to substantial price
fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors including changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and
other petrochemical products from which resins are produced. In the first half of 2021 to date, the price of
raw materials has been generally increasing and the availability of raw materials has been decreasing,
including as a result of the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic in certain countries. For example, in the
first three months of 2021, the average prices of plastic resins (HDPE Europe) increased by 10.7% and
aluminum prices increased by 12.4%, in each case compared to the first three months of 2020. Instability in
the world markets for petroleum and natural gas and unavailability of raw materials, including as a
consequence of the worsening impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in certain countries, such as India, could
materially adversely affect the price and supply of raw materials and negatively impact our supply chain.

In the event that significant increases in raw materials and gas, oil and petrochemical prices occur in
the future, our margins may be negatively impacted. Most of our sales are either made to customers on the
basis of purchase orders or short-term contracts without cost pass-through clauses, providing us with no
assurance that we can pass on price increases to these customers, or pursuant to contracts that generally
allow only periodic price adjustments, which could delay our ability to pass on price increases to these
customers, if at all. In addition, we may not be able to rely on an uninterrupted supply of raw materials
from our regular vendors in the countries in which we operate, or from alternative sources in the event of a
local or international shortage of the raw materials used by us, or we may encounter a shortage or
discontinuation of certain types of materials purchased from one or more of our suppliers.

While at present we do not hedge plastic resin purchases, as derivative instruments are not available
in the markets, we have historically hedged a portion of our total aluminum purchases through forward
contracts with brokers operating on the London Metal Exchange. In particular, we historically hedged the
majority of our aluminum purchases, respectively. However, the use of forward contracts to reduce the
impact of fluctuating aluminum prices may lead to an adverse effect should the price of aluminum move in
the opposite direction to that which the forward contract was intending to hedge.

Additionally, global trade and the introduction of import duties or tariffs may increase the costs
incurred by the Group for the supply of our principal raw materials. In recent years, the United States
introduced tariffs on certain metals produced in certain countries, including aluminum. While these tariffs
did not significantly affect our activities, we could be materially adversely impacted if these tariffs were to
significantly increase or if reciprocal tariffs were introduced in other countries in which we operate or from
which we obtain supplies. Similarly, a global trade war could significantly increase the costs of our key raw
materials and/or limit the availability of such materials from some markets. Any of these and/or the
foregoing could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 15%, 13%, 9% and 5% of our net revenue from sales in
U.S. dollars, Pounds Sterling, Indian rupees and Australian dollars, respectively. These currencies have
experienced considerable volatility against the euro in recent years. To prepare our consolidated financial
statements, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into euro. Consequently,
increases and decreases in the value of the euro against these other currencies will affect the amounts
attributed to these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in
their original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period
to period. For example, our reported results of operations were significantly impacted by negative
translation effects of the appreciation of the euro in 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. In 2020, our Net
Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates was €603.8 million (as compared to net revenue of €572.0 million).
In addition, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was
€147.2 million (as compared to net revenue of €138.3 million). The foregoing impact on our results of
operations is mainly due to the translation effect of non-euro revenues generated during the periods and
the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the Pounds Sterling as well as emerging market
currencies such as the Indian rupee, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Argentinian peso and the Mexican peso.
Given our presence and continuous focus in non-Eurozone markets, this risk is expected to increase over
time.

In addition, our key raw materials such as plastic resin and aluminum have underlying global
commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollars and we process a significant portion of such
materials at our Magenta plant in Italy, incurring related costs in euro. At the same time, our customer
contracts are typically payable in the currency of the country where the contract is signed, even if the
customer may sell spirits or wine for a worldwide consumer base. Therefore, to the extent we incur
expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as the related revenue, exchange rate fluctuations
could cause our expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Principal factors
_affecting our results of operations—Fluctuations in currency exchange rates”. Any of these developments_
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_A decrease in the consumption of spirits and/or wine could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

We sell most of our products to producers of spirits and wine. Sales to spirits and wine producers
represented 82% of our net revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Demand for most of our
products is determined largely by the extent to which end-users consume spirits or wine, which in turn is
partly affected by consumers’ disposable income, evolving customer habits and lifestyles, industry trends
and population growth rates, among other things. In addition, luxury closures, which often include a high
value-added component in their design and technology, may be particularly susceptible to consumer
perceptions regarding brand value or wider societal trends, particularly in established markets. To the
extent the brands for which we provide closures become less popular or experience a fall in consumption,
our sales may likewise suffer. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a negative effect
on the HORECA industries, and, in turn, led to decreased demand for products in the spirit market, which
are typically consumed at bars and restaurants, and the water and beverage market, which relies heavily on
on-premises consumption. Travel restrictions also negatively impacted sales of spirits through the duty free
channel. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021,
our net revenue from sales to producers of spirits decreased by €55.4 million (or 13.8%) and €2.4 million
(or 2.7%) compared to, respectively, the year ended December 31, 2019 and the three months ended
March 31, 2020, primarily due to lower demand and on-premises consumption by customers in the United
Kingdom, India, Poland, Italy, Spain and Colombia, which resulted in lower sales volumes of spirits. In
addition, in the first quarter of 2021, our net revenue from sales in the water and beverages market
decreased by €5.1 million (or 29.1%) compared to the first quarter of 2020.

Changes in levels of taxation and other governmental controls over the production, sale or marketing
of spirits and wine, in certain countries in which we operate, such as in India, Russia, Scotland, Australia,
South Africa, Turkey and some South American countries, may lead to a decreased supply of spirits and
wine, and an associated decrease in demand for our closures. A decrease in the consumption of alcoholic
beverages and a corresponding drop in the sale of spirits and wine could have a negative effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic, certain countries in which we operate, including India and South Africa, introduced alcohol sale
bans which had a negative impact on our sales volumes in 2020. Regardless of actual levels of end-use
consumption, a perception among producers of spirits and wine that demand may be about to fall could
lead to a decision by such producers to reduce their stocks of spirits and wine, which could in turn lead to
reduced demand for our closures. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may not be able to protect our intellectual property against competitors or maintain its value._**

Our future success depends largely on the development and maintenance of our intellectual property
rights. As of March 31, 2021, we held over 170 active patents and other IP rights in respect of our products
with approximately 29% of our sales in 2020 covered by patents. Third parties may challenge our
intellectual property rights, produce counterfeit products that imitate our products, or come to know our
trade secrets due to breaches of confidentiality agreements or otherwise. We defend our intellectual
property rights whenever necessary before any competent authority and in any jurisdiction. We may spend
significant resources monitoring, protecting and enforcing these rights and we may not be successful in our
efforts to do so. The risk that we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights is likely to
increase as we expand into new geographic areas, particularly emerging markets, including in Asia, where
IP rights are less robust that more developed markets, and diversify into new product sectors, including our

39


-----

new “Internet-of-Closures” smart family products. If we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property
rights, our brands, sales volumes and market share could be negatively impacted, which would have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our products are protected by patents and other IP rights for a limited period of time and therefore
we periodically lose IP protection when those protections expire. We cannot assure you that upon the
expiration of any of our patents or other IP rights, our competitors will not commence manufacturing
products using similar technologies to those protected by our current patents or exploiting intellectual
property that was previously protected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may fail to realize the anticipated business growth opportunities, revenue benefits, cost synergies, operational_**
**_efficiencies and other benefits anticipated from, or may incur, unanticipated costs associated with future_**
**_acquisitions._**

We have historically expanded our business through acquisitions, along with organic growth, and we
may evaluate other potential opportunities that fit our investment criteria. For example, in 2018, we
acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a long-standing presence in the Scottish market,
which supplies closures to some landmark scotch whisky brands. In addition, in 2020 we acquired
Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the
glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we also
acquired a stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London.
We may seek out and consummate further acquisitions in the future where we believe doing so would
further our strategic plans and offer growth potential. In particular, we may identify expansion
opportunities that would help us grow in new geographical markets with high levels of alcohol
consumption that we view as underpenetrated including, for example, South Africa and certain countries
in Asia. In addition, we may identify acquisitions that would allow us to consolidate our position in the
market for aluminum and plastics closures, and diversify our business through the expansion in the market
for closures made of alternative materials such as cork as well as in adjacent product markets, such as food
and beverages, including water, beauty and the pharmaceutical industries. However, there can be no
assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or complete any
future acquisitions. In the event we were able to identify acquisition opportunities, any such transactions
would involve significant risks, including the diversion of management’s attention from other business
concerns and effects on our business relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, we cannot
assure you that we will be successful at integrating the newly acquired businesses, that they will perform as
anticipated or that we will realize the anticipated synergies, efficiencies and other benefits. These types of
challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and
results of operations. We may not be able to effectively manage the combined operations and assets or
realize any of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.

Furthermore, there may be liabilities associated with the businesses we attempt to acquire, or we may
finance acquisitions with debt which could in turn increase our leverage. The obligations and liabilities of
an acquired business may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of such business
and there is a risk that such historical financial statements may contain errors. We may also become
responsible for liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence procedures in connection with our historical acquisitions and any future acquisitions.

We have typically required the sellers in past acquisitions to indemnify us against certain undisclosed
liabilities. However, we cannot be certain that the indemnification rights that we have obtained, or will
obtain in the future, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset
the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any of these liabilities,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We are subject to continued increases in energy and freight costs._**

In addition to our dependence on primary raw materials, due to the energy intensive nature of our
industrial processes, we are also dependent on a number of different energy sources, including fuel oil,
electricity and natural gas. If, for any reason, certain of our energy supply contracts were terminated in a
country where we have major operations, or were not renewed upon expiration, or if market conditions
were to substantially change resulting in a significant increase in the price of fuel oil, electricity or natural

40


-----

gas, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable suppliers or suppliers capable of providing fuel oil,
electricity or natural gas on terms or in amounts satisfactory to us. As a result of any of these events, our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.

We are also dependent on third parties for the transportation of our raw materials, as well as the
products we manufacture and sell. In certain jurisdictions, we are exposed to import duties and freight
costs. Freight costs are influenced by carrier availability and fluctuating oil prices. Energy and freight costs
represented 21% of our overall raw materials costs in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.
Accordingly, the cyclical nature of such commodity pricing, energy and freight costs presents a potential
risk to our margins. Moreover, an increase in the selling prices for the products we produce resulting from
an attempt to pass through increased energy or freight costs could have an adverse impact on the volume
of units we sell and decrease our revenue.

**_Consolidation in the spirits industry, the concentration of our customers and concentration of end-point_**
**_distribution networks could undermine our competitive position._**

The spirits market has experienced significant consolidation in the past fifteen years. For example, in
early 2018, multinationals Diageo plc and Bacardi Limited purchased Gerber Spirit Company (the
producer of Casamigo tequila and mezcal) and Patrón Spirits International AG, respectively, and in 2019,
Campari Group acquired the French company Rhumantilles (the producer of Trois Rivières, La Mauny
and Dusquene rum brands). Consolidation among our customers has resulted in increased price pressure.
A further reduction in the number of customers could lead to increased price competition among closures
suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and profitability. In each of the year
ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, approximately 30.4% of our net
revenue was generated from sales to our five largest customers, two of which contributed over 20% of our
total net revenue in the same periods. We could lose revenue and market share if, following the
consolidation of one or more of our customers with another company, a competitor were to become the
primary closures supplier of any such resulting consolidated company. Alternatively, if that new company
were able to extract more favorable terms from us, we could lose revenue and market share. If we lose
customers because of, among others, pricing, our customers preferring our competitors to us, other
methods of competition from our competitors or our customers’ shutdowns or insolvency, our revenue,
operating results and financial position may be negatively affected. For instance, as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our customers temporarily halted their operations, reduced orders or
postponed their demand, which resulted in a decrease in sales volumes in the year ended December 31,
2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. If in the future the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic was to continue or worsen, our customers may have to halt their operations, reduce or postpone
orders, any of which would result in further decreases in our sales volumes.

End-point distributors are also consolidating. For example, U.S. wine distributors Republic National
Distributing Company merged with Breakthru Beverage Group in 2018. More recently, Coca Cola
European Partners acquired major bottler Coca Cola Amatil in Australia in 2021, creating Coca Cola
Europacific Partners, the largest Coca Cola bottler in the world. Consolidation of our end-point
distributors may result in increased pricing pressure on spirits and wine producers who may in turn lead
our direct customers to seek to price their closures more aggressively.

The majority of our supply contracts have a duration of only one year, and there is no obligation on
our customers to purchase specified quantities during that period. There are also some clients to whom we
sell customized and exclusive closures; in such cases we have multi-year, renewable contracts as the
product is customized to that particular customer. We are reliant on a continuing series of contract
renewals and/or purchase orders for our products. Thus, the loss of any of our major customers could
significantly reduce our number of purchase orders, including those received at short notice and
consequently cause our revenue to fall without providing us with sufficient time to replace the leaving
customer with a new customer or adjust our stock levels appropriately by changing the amounts of our
purchases from suppliers. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are affected by seasonality in certain of our businesses, notably screwcaps for wine closures._**

Some of our product lines are subject to seasonal variations. Sales of spirits tend to increase in the
holiday season, and therefore sales of our safety and roll-on closures for spirits are generally higher during
the second half of each calendar year. Demand for certain beverages, particularly wine and mineral water,

41


-----

and consequently the related caps and closures for such beverages, may be affected by adverse weather
conditions, especially during the summer months when prolonged periods of unseasonably cool or wet
weather in a particular market may affect sales volumes and, therefore, the results of our operations. In
addition, wine growers are subject to the risk of a poor year or vintage which may, because of reduced
demand for their products, reduce overall demand for our screwcaps for wine closures, one of our main
product lines. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_If we fail to introduce new and innovative products, adapt to developments in technology or respond to changes in_**
**_consumer requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer._**

We believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to introduce new and innovative
products and to continuously update existing products to provide our customers with high quality,
aesthetically appealing and technologically sophisticated products. Our success also depends on our ability
to react to changing consumer demands, preferences and habits in a timely manner. If we fail to keep pace
with product development, anticipate consumer preferences, meet consumer demands or understand
consumer habits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our businesses are subject to frequent and sometimes significant changes in technology and if we fail
to anticipate or adequately respond to such changes, or do not have sufficient capital to invest in these
developments, our profits may decline. Our future financial performance will depend in part upon our
ability to implement and utilize technology successfully to improve our business operations. We cannot
predict all the effects of future technological changes. The cost of implementing new technologies could be
significant, and our ability to finance these technological developments may be adversely affected by our
debt servicing requirements or our inability to obtain the financing we require to develop or acquire
competing technologies.

In addition, our revenue and market share may suffer if any products or services that we plan to
introduce fail to achieve market acceptance or experience technical difficulties. Introducing new products
or features requires a high level of financial and managerial commitment to research and development. In
the last three years, we made significant investments in product development and intend to continue to do
so in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the investments we have made in product
development and technology will generate expected returns by enabling us to increase or maintain market
share. If we fail to maintain our level of investments in research and development, or fail to generate
expected returns on those investments, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_If we are unable to effectively manage our inventory in line with customer and market needs and demands, it_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We are exposed to the risk of not being able to dispose of all of our inventory. In order to meet our
customers’ needs, including due to seasonality, we build-up inventory of products and develop new
products to meet market changes and demands. Some finished and semi-finished products that we have in
stock may become obsolete before being sold or we may realize a slower turnover than expected. Where
the quantity of finished and semi-finished products in stock exceeds the demand from our customers, we
may need to dispose of unsold or obsolete goods. Inventory not sold is written down in relation to their
presumed possible use or future realization, and by including specific provisions in our accounts amending
the value of the inventory where necessary. A significant impairment of inventory may result in a charge to
our income statement. Although we have measures in place designed to monitor the obsolescence of our
products and to minimize latent inventory levels, if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively in
line with customer and market demands, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Loss of, limited use of, or relocation of one or more of our key production facilities could have material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

While we manufacture most of our products in a large number of diversified facilities, and maintain
insurance covering these facilities, a loss of the use of all or a portion of any of, or limited use of, our key
production facilities due to an accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, pandemics,
issues with energy supplies, delays in obtaining replacement equipment or otherwise, whether short or
long-term, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of

42


-----

operations. For example, in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to
halt operations at some of our facilities in the first and second quarter of 2020. In particular, we had to
temporarily shut down all our facilities in India, and partially close some of our facilities in South Africa,
where we had to suspend production for over one month due to a ban on the production of closures for
spirits. In addition, we entirely converted some of our production lines in Colombia to make closures for
disinfectants between March and May 2020. These total or partial closures and conversion had a negative
impact on our sales volumes and net revenue in 2020, including as a result to costs incurred to adapt the
business line to the production of new goods. Although we have appropriate insurance coverage in relation
to material damage to property and the interruption of manufacturing resulting from natural or accidental
events, amongst others, there is no guarantee that such coverage will be sufficient to compensate for
damage and cost incurred by us. In addition, our existing insurance policies do not cover any losses arising
from business interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—We may incur liabilities that are not
_covered by insurance”._

In addition, we occasionally relocate manufacturing production and close down facilities or move
parts of those facilities to other sites where it makes operational sense to do so for production efficiency
reasons. For example, in the first quarter of 2018, we decided to close the secondary site of our facilities in
Scotland (in the Broomhill Industrial Estate, Kirkintilloch) with a progressive transfer of the equipment
and machinery to our main site (in the Old Mill Industrial Estate, Kirkintilloch). In 2019, we moved some
of our production volumes from our facility in India to our start-up in Kenya. If we were unable to manage
such closures and relocations efficiently or effectively, it could lead to disruption in our production
capacities and ability to meet customer needs, thereby causing an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Moreover, consolidation of facilities and production process could
heighten the potential impact associated with any loss or restriction on use of our key facilities.

**_Employee slowdowns, work stoppages, labor disputes, strikes and similar actions could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

A significant number of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are
represented by works councils covering locations in various countries in which we operate. The work of our
employees, including the transportation and delivery of raw materials to our production facilities and of
our products to our customers is critical to our business. In many cases, before we take significant actions
with respect to our production facilities, such as workforce reductions or closures, we must reach an
agreement with the labor unions and employee works councils at such facilities. Any work stoppages
resulting from employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level of customer service.
In addition, we may become party to labor disputes with certain of our employees, including in connection
with termination of their employment relations with us, and from time to time we may carry out collective
dismissals. Such collective dismissals may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our
employees and we may be required to pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims.
Any disputes with our employees or work stoppages resulting from strikes or other labor action could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In Italy, dismissals
for economic reasons are generally prohibited until June 30, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
pursuant to Italian Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020 (Legge di Bilancio 2021) and Italian Law Decree
No. 41 of March 22, 2021 (Decreto Sostegni). All workers performing their activity in Italy are covered by
mandatory social security insurance. This system is financed by contributions from employees and
employers, calculated as a percentage of the employee’s gross remuneration. These contributions
represent a relatively high surcharge on labor costs. Also, in Italy, national insurance contributions to
INAIL (the National Institute for Accidents at Work), which covers all professional risks, are mandatory.
In addition to these social security measures, employers must set aside in their financial statements (or pay
into supplementary pension funds) a mandatory severance payment (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto or
TFR), which is deferred remuneration equal to 1/13.5 of any remuneration paid to the employees in
connection with the employment relationship. Any changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or
regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations, including in connection with the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational
flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees and their representatives, difficulties
in maintaining compliance with applicable employment regulations or prolonged labor disputes,
slowdowns, strikes or similar actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

43


-----

**_Increased competition or an industry-wide imbalance between supply and demand could reduce our sales and_**
**_profitability._**

While competition in the safety closures business is limited to a relatively small number of major
producers, we believe that the standard and screwcaps for wine closures businesses are more competitive,
due to the commoditized nature of the products. As a result, product pricing and innovative technology are
key competitive factors. Our main global competitors in the closures market for spirits are Amcor, Alpast,
Alcopack, Berry Global Group, Torrent and Bernicap, with most of our remaining competitors being
either local or regional companies supplying primarily only single regions of the world.

In addition, our profitability is heavily influenced by the supply of, and demand for, closures. We
cannot assure you that the manufacturing capacity for closures in any of our markets will not increase
further in the future, nor can we assure you that demand for closures will meet or exceed supply. If
manufacturing capacity for closures increases and there is no corresponding increase in demand, including
as a result of restrictive measures implemented in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or if
there is a decrease in demand but manufacturing capacity remains constant, the prices we receive for our
products could materially decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Concerns about the effects of climate change may have an impact on our business._**

Concerns about global warming and carbon footprints, as well as legal and financial incentives
favouring alternative fuels, are causing an increased use of sustainable, non-fossil fuel sources for
electricity generation. Electricity generation companies are competing in the same markets as us for the
same raw materials that we use in some of our production process (such as fuel oil, electricity and natural
gas) driving prices for such materials upwards, especially during the winter in the Northern hemisphere.
Any resulting additional costs or supply shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may incur substantial costs, be subject to litigation and/or harm our reputation if our products are defective._**

Our products may not operate properly or may have defects, particularly when the first products of a
new product line or enhanced products within an existing product line are introduced. If our customers or
end-consumers were to bring claims against us alleging defects in the manufacture or design of our
closures, we could incur substantial costs in responding to such complaints or become involved in litigation.
If any of our products were found to be defective, we could be required to pay substantial damages and
incur significant costs associated with product recalls or experience harm to our brand and reputation. In
the course of our development of more sophisticated product designs tailored to consumer demands,
preferences and habits, we may face material product liability claims or product recalls in the future and
may not be able to dispose of any such claims successfully or institute any such product recalls at
acceptable costs.

Although we currently hold insurance coverage for these types of liabilities in amounts we believe to
be adequate, our coverage may not be adequate to insure against all product liability claims that may arise.
As a result of the factors above, product defect claims or product recalls may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to costs and liabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards and_**
**_regulations._**

We are subject to a broad range of environmental and health and safety standards, laws and
regulations in the countries in which we currently operate our production facilities as well as to various
supranational regulations. These laws and regulations impose increasingly stringent environmental
protection standards regarding, among other things, the use, storage and handling of hazardous materials,
discharge and disposal of factory waste, the remediation of environmental damage or contamination (in
particular, sites operated for many years may be more susceptible to potential incidents leading to
contamination), and safety standards relating to industrial installations and processes. We are also subject
to stringent health and safety standards relating to our employees or other third parties at our production
facilities.

The scope of such laws and regulations varies across the different jurisdictions in which we operate.
For example, our operations and properties must comply with the legal requirements in each jurisdiction,

44


-----

as well as EU and international legal requirements, including for example the EU’s so called “Machinery
Directive”. It is possible that we may face unforeseen regulatory breaches in other EU countries in
violation of applicable EU directives, regulations or laws and may incur other or more significant penalties
for failing to comply with the applicable domestic law implementing such other directives, regulations or
laws. Furthermore, such infringements could result in the need to implement potentially costly and
unexpected measures to correct any non-compliance. The cost of complying with the laws and regulations
across the different jurisdictions in which we operate, or the consequences of a failure to comply with
them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our products are subject to food and beverage packaging regulations that govern the
manufacture and marketing of plastic materials and goods that come into contact with, or can reasonably
be expected to contact with, food and beverages. Food and beverage packaging regulations limit the
substances that can be used in our products and regulate product purity and quality. These regulations
typically set out a list of authorized substances that may be used in the manufacture of such plastic
materials and establish a limit on the transfer of constituent elements from the plastic to food or
beverages. We may be required to change raw materials or production processes to comply with future
food and beverage packaging legislation or regulations addressing product and content safety in
jurisdictions where we manufacture and/or sell our products, which could result in increased production
costs. Changes in health and safety regulations in jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products
could potentially lead to a decrease in demand for our products due to our customers preferring to source
products from our competitors as a result of our failure to comply with such health and safety regulations.

Moreover, the regulatory framework in the countries in which we operate often evolve and we may
become subject to additional or different regulations and standards. Environmental and health and safety
regulations as well as future events, such as changes in laws and technology, the promulgation of new laws
or the development or the discovery of new facts or conditions could expose us to the risks of incurring
substantial costs and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our industry is complex and can involve litigation and disputes that could be damaging to our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

In the course of our business activities, from time to time, we are exposed to significant litigation and/
or regulatory proceedings, including but not limited to breach of contract, contractual disputes, debt
collection proceedings, intellectual property disputes, personal injury insurance and product liability
claims, employee disputes and consumer protection regulation. For example, we have been involved in
personal injury claims and other proceedings in relation to workplace accidents that occurred at our
manufacturing facilities. Significant litigation and/or regulatory proceedings may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or cause us significant
reputational harm due to, amongst other things, monetary costs, imposition of fines, penalties or of more
stringent regulatory requirements, or reputational damage. See also “—We may face liabilities and
_sanctions under Italian law with respect to Decree 231”._

In the event we were unsuccessful in any litigation, proceedings or other disputes, we could be
exposed to the risk that the provisions for associated costs and expenses may be insufficient or that, even if
we are not impacted monetarily, we could face the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements or
inspections and/or could suffer damage to our image and reputation, which in turn could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may incur liability and costs in connection with hazardous substances used in production or present at certain_**
**_of our facilities._**

We use a limited number of hazardous substances in our manufacturing activities. In the event that
any of these substances, such as aluminum or solvents, proves to be toxic, we may incur increased costs for
health related claims or the removal or re-treatment of such substances. Additionally, although we do not
currently use asbestos or its derivatives as raw materials in our manufacturing process, there is some risk of
asbestos exposure at certain of our facilities located in Italy, which could cause harm to persons, and costs
related to asbestos remediation and/or removal. In the past, asbestos containing materials (“ACMs”) were
commonly used as building materials such as insulation or tiling in industrial buildings. The use of ACMs
was standard practice throughout the world until the late 1970s when it began to be phased out. Given the
varying ages of our Italian production facilities, we have identified ACMs as being present at certain
facilities. As a result, we could be subject to personal injury claims relating to damages that certain of our

45


-----

employees may allege to have suffered. Should we face any such claims, we could incur significant costs
defending against such claims and could be required to pay potentially significant damage awards. Any of
these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially_**
**_adverse tax consequences._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions (including
Ukrainian, Polish, Brazilian and Argentinean tax laws, among others) as a result of the international scope
of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our
tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, we are regularly subject to the
examination of our corporate income tax arrangements by the Italian tax authorities (particularly with
respect to our financing and deductibility of interest) as well as the governing tax authorities in other
countries where we operate. We routinely assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We are also subject to inter-company
pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies pursuant to, for example,
purchase agreements, licensing agreements or other arrangements. Adverse developments in these laws or
regulations, or any change in position by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise
make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable
jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or
characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our
indebtedness, including the Notes, existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction
of interest expenses. We could also fail, whether inadvertently or through reasons beyond our control, to
comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of various of our financing
arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. For example, as a
result of the reclassification of the interest rate of the withholding tax applied to payments we made in
2018 to our former parent company, GCL Holdings SCA, relating to interests on certain financial
instruments, on April 29, 2021, we had to pay €0.5 million to the competent tax authorities using our
provision for tax risks set up as of December 31, 2020. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully
challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our intercompany loans or transactions, it could
result in the disallowance of deductions, limit our ability to deduct interest expenses, the imposition of
withholding taxes, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest on intercompany loans or
internal deemed transfers, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest or other
consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other
indebtedness.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our
business. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for insurance policies can increase
substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance policies may no longer be available, may be
available but not economically viable relative to the liability to be insured against or may be available only
for reduced amounts of coverage. While we maintain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate
against risks commonly insured against in the industry, there can be no guarantee that all such risks are
covered by insurance or that we will be able to obtain the levels of cover desired by us on acceptable terms
in the future. In addition, even with such insurance in place, the risk remains that we may incur liabilities
to customers and other third parties which exceed the limits of the insurance cover or are not covered by it
at all. Should such a situation arise, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or political conditions._**

General global economic conditions and macroeconomic trends can negatively affect overall demand
for our products and the markets in which we operate. For example, our business, financial condition and
results of operations were adversely impacted by the effects of the global economic crisis that commenced
in 2007-2008 and the Eurozone crisis that affected certain markets subsequently. In recent years, there

46


-----

have been challenging years in the world economy, due in part to political turmoil and/or upheaval in a
number of regions, the occurrence of terrorist attacks, and more recently, a looming trade war, which has
resulted in high currency volatility and tumultuous markets. Beginning in early 2020, global market and
economic conditions have been negatively impacted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
resulting in severe economic downturns in our markets. Disruptions in the overall economy and volatility
in financial markets could reduce consumer confidence and increase unemployment, negatively affecting
consumer spending and discretionary income, which could be harmful to our business, financial condition
and results of operations. In emerging markets in particular, where growth relies on a continued
distribution of wealth, development of retail and distribution infrastructure and a reduction of trade
barriers, our operations may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn, including as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. See also “—The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on
_our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, which may be material”._

Demand for closures in the principal end-use markets that we serve is primarily driven by consumer
consumption of the products for which we produce closures. General economic conditions affect
consumption in our end-use markets, including spirits, wines and other beverages. Downturns or periods of
prolonged economic weakness have resulted in the past, and could in the future result, in decreased
demand for closures. In particular, our business could be negatively affected by adverse economic
conditions that result in difficulties for any of our major customers, including due to the COVID-19
pandemic. The outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic remains
subject to unprecedented uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged and many national
governments have instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. The continuation or
worsening of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions or a renewed or future recession could result in,
among other things, decreases in market prices for our products, a loss of customers spending in the spirits
and wine industries and increased payment delays and/or bad debts as a result of our customers
experiencing financial difficulty. Any deterioration in financial markets could also impair our ability to
obtain financing in the future, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness to continue our
ongoing operations or fund liquidity needs.

According to Eurostat, the European Commission statistical agency, the real gross domestic product
(“GDP”) growth rate in the Participating Member States (which are countries that have adopted the euro)
has been sluggish in recent periods, growing at a rate of 1.9% in 2018 and 1.3% in 2019, and decreasing by
6.6% in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there are considerable divergences
between GDP growth among the constituents of the Participating Member States. Concerns over inflation,
unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, sovereign debt and the instability of the euro have
contributed to increased volatility in recent years and diminished expectations for the economies of the
Participating Member States going forward. A significant portion of our revenue is generated in the
Participating Member States as is a significant portion of our production, sourcing and financing activities.
The effects on the European and global economy of any exit of one or more constituents of the
Participating Member States from the economic and monetary union, the dissolution of the euro and the
possible redenomination of financial instruments or other contractual obligations from euro into a
different currency, or the perception that any of these events are imminent, are inherently difficult to
predict and could give rise to operational disruptions or other risks of contagion to our business, including
our financing activities, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. See also “—Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential
_re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone could have adverse consequences for us with_
_respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated”._

**_Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the recent exit of the United Kingdom from the European_**
**_Union may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We carry out a considerable part of our business in the United Kingdom and this has increased since
our acquisition of the Scottish company Guala Closures UCP in 2018. For the twelve months ended
March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom generated 17% of our net revenue.

Following the outcome of a referendum on EU membership, on March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom
formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the European Union (“Brexit”), and on
January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union on the basis of a previously negotiated
withdrawal agreement, which was adopted by the parliament of the United Kingdom on January 24, 2020.
On December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced that they had reached a
comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement in principle (the “EU-UK Trade and

47


-----

**Cooperation Agreement”). On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom implemented the EU-UK Trade**
and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021. Despite the
implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on
that date has, among other things, led to increased customs and health and safety checks at the border,
which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and
may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United
Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the European
Union.

Due to the size and importance of the United Kingdom’s economy, the uncertainty and
unpredictability concerning the United Kingdom’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe
after Brexit may continue to be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant
currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border
cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the
foreseeable future.

In particular, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the
relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union under the EU-UK Trade and
Cooperation Agreement will differ materially in practice from the past. Lack of clarity about future laws
and regulations in the United Kingdom as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to
replace or replicate could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. The economic
outlook could be further adversely affected by, among other things: (i) the risk arising from changes in laws
and regulations in the U.K.; (ii) the risk that movements in the U.K. pound exchange rates related to
Brexit could damage competitiveness or profitability; (iii) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and
any member of the EU may be subject to duties and tariffs; and (iv) the risk that goods moving between
the U.K. and any member of the EU will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks,
leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Any disruptions at English ports such as Dover
and Immingham, resulting in delays and supply disruptions, could have a material adverse impact on our
exports to the United Kingdom. Changes to the trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU are
expected to result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. If tariff rates are
levied on our exports from the European Union to the United Kingdom and customs-related costs
increase, we may face additional costs in our operations. Our results of operations may also be impacted if
we lose our import or local transport permits or if our end-market customers experience additional costs in
exporting goods to the United Kingdom.

As a result, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Civil disturbances, political instability and military action in Ukraine and Russia may impact and affect our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We have significant business operations in Ukraine, including an operating subsidiary and a
production facility, and also have sales into the Russian market. In the past years, significant civil
disturbances and political instability in Ukraine as well as the armed conflict in the region of Crimea,
including ongoing military action in some regions in Eastern Ukraine, have negatively impacted the
Ukrainian and Russian economies, the relations between these two countries and between Russia and
other countries where we operate. Escalating geopolitical tensions have had an adverse effect on the
Ukrainian and Russian markets, and there have been reports of increased capital outflows from Ukraine
and Russia. The ability of Ukrainian and Russian companies and financial institutions to obtain funding
from the international capital markets has also been hampered as a result of decreased demand for
Ukrainian and Russian credit exposure.

Ukraine is exposed to the risk of Hryvnia exchange rate fluctuations. Various fluctuations ranged
from 100% to 30%, since March 2019. The average exchange rate of the Hryvnia against the U.S. dollar
has depreciated in 2020 by 4.2% year-on-year and amounted to 26.96 Hryvnia for $1.00 in 2020 primarily
due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in local bond holdings by foreign investors.

Despite numerous failed ceasefires brokered with international assistance, supported by the presence
of international observers, the risk of further intensification of aggression against Ukraine in Eastern
Ukraine remains high and the full implementation of the terms of the existing ceasefire arrangements
remains challenging. Any continuing or escalating military action in Eastern Ukraine could have a further
material adverse effect on the Ukrainian and Russian economies and consequently affect (i) our ability to

48


-----

obtain local financing; (ii) our ability to collect accounts receivables; (iii) the ability of our Ukrainian
subsidiary to pay dividends; (iv) our ability to use our cash held in Ukraine; (v) the governments’ ability to
meet their payment obligations on amounts due to us, such as VAT refunds; (vi) the governments’ ability
to maintain critical transport infrastructure, such as rail networks; and (vii) Ukrainian and Russian
taxation rates applicable to us, all or any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

As a result of ongoing events involving Ukraine and Russia, the United States, the European Union,
the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions have imposed sanctions on certain Russian and Ukrainian
persons and entities, including certain Russian banks, energy companies and defense companies, and have
imposed restrictions on exports of various items to Russia and Ukraine. Additionally, Russia has
introduced a ban on the import of certain goods and food supplies from the United States, the European
Union member states, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Norway. In 2019, Russia has also
introduced a ban on the import of certain goods, including closures, from Ukraine, which has negatively
impacted sales volumes of our Ukrainian subsidiary. Any overall decline in the Russian or Ukrainian
economy and weakening of the Russian ruble or the Ukrainian hryvnia that ultimately has any impact on
the closures industry or our destination markets and the supply of energy and raw materials in the longterm could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Disruptions to the operations of computer or data processing systems may have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

The operation of our production facilities as well as the sales, marketing and service activities depend
on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication
and data processing systems. Computer and data processing systems and related infrastructure (data
center, hardware and wide and local area networks) are generally exposed to the risk of disturbances,
damage, electricity failures, computer viruses, fire, other disasters, cyber-attacks and similar events.

Disruptions to, or interruptions in, operations involving these systems may occur in the future. Any
significant interruption or slowdown of our current or future information systems as a result of a system
security failure could adversely affect our ability to efficiently maintain our production processes and to
ensure adequate controls. Disruptions to or interruptions in operations could lead to production downtime
which, in turn, could result in lost revenue and thus adversely impact our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our IT systems capture a large amount of customer data, and theft of sensitive data and our inability
to protect trade secrets and personal identifiable information of our employees, customers or suppliers
could have an adverse effect on our business, customers, suppliers and employees. Although
administration and production networks are separated, an interruption in the operations of computer or
data processing systems could adversely affect our ability to efficiently maintain our production processes
and to ensure adequate controls. Disruptions to or interruptions in operations could lead to production
downtime which, in turn, could result in lost sales. We also depend on the hosting company’s infrastructure
and any interruption, disruption or security breaches at the hosting company’s data center may have an
adverse effect on our operations. If one or more of these risks materializes, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We collect and process personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate law and_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We collect, store and use personal data in the ordinary course of our business operations. We are
therefore subject to data protection legislation (including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU
2016/679) (the “GDPR”)). The GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately
binding across all Member States of the European Union, is a privacy regime regarding the protection of
natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. The
GDPR obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about
European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large
number of obligations, which relate, for example, to (i) the processing of personal data including
transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of
the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to
identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others,
transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR obligates

49


-----

companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy
implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data. We
work to continue to be fully compliant with our obligations under the GDPR and have engaged an external
data protection officer who, among other things, advises on our compliance obligations and assists us in
ensuring that our software systems safely process personal data, which mainly relates to our employees.

Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties, including fines of up to 4% of
total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity
of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by
supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Non-compliance or technical defects
resulting in a leak or the misuse of such data could also result in damage to our reputation and otherwise
harm our business. In addition, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage and we
cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities
in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Should one or more of these risks materialize, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Laws and other factors restricting the exchange of currencies or the expatriation of funds limit the ability of our_**
**_subsidiaries in Argentina and Ukraine to make funds available to us which may have an adverse impact on our_**
**_ability to manage our cash flows._**

We have faced fund repatriation issues in Argentina and Ukraine and may not be able to repatriate
the funds held by our Argentinean and Ukrainian subsidiaries, or any additional cash flows generated by
our operations in these countries, on a timely basis or at all. In addition to Argentina and Ukraine, we may
also be subject to similar restrictions on the exchange of currencies or expatriation of funds in other
jurisdictions where we operate. Such restrictions may delay or prevent our ability to manage our cash
flows, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. The National Bank of Ukraine is empowered to establish policies for and to regulate currency
operations in Ukraine and has the power to establish restrictions on currency operations and repatriation.
Although the National Bank of Ukraine eased certain currency control restrictions since 2016, it may use
further currency control measures in the future preventing us from adequately facing relevant currency
risks and depleting our foreign exchange reserves, including mandatory currency conversions, the
limitation of the amount of dividends payable in favor of non-Ukrainian shareholders and the limitation on
making investments abroad. See also “—Civil disturbances, political instability and military action in Ukraine
_and Russia may impact and affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” above._

**_We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations applicable_**
**_in the countries in which we operate or in which we may operate in the future._**

Due to the international scope of our operations, we, our partners and competitors must comply with
certain anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, European Anti-Bribery Conventions and other similar
worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making
improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business.

We operate in certain parts of the world that lack a developed legal system or have experienced
widespread corruption. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as Colombia, we also
regularly contract with state-owned distilleries which involves compliance with state tender laws and
related regulations. Under certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict
with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite
our compliance policies and training efforts, we cannot assure you that prohibited acts under these policies
will not be committed by our employees.

Furthermore, due to the global nature of our operations, we may use local agents or subcontractors to
understand unfamiliar environments and differences in cultural, legal, financial and accounting
complexities and obligations, or to carry out a portion of the activities called for by a particular contract.
There is a risk that such agents or subcontractors may be involved in illegitimate activities in local markets
that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately supervise them or maintain an adequate compliance
program, we may be liable for their actions.

Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset
seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or
restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively

50


-----

impact our reputation and consequently, our ability to win future business. On the other hand, any such
violation by our competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair advantage when bidding for
contracts. The consequences that we may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract new management and other personnel,_**
**_could impact our business._**

We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to operate our businesses and on
our in-house technical experts to develop new products and technologies and to service our customers. The
loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that
rely heavily on engineering and technology is intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to
attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion
of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research and development activities successfully or
develop and support marketable products.

**_We may face liabilities and sanctions under Italian law with respect to Decree 231._**

Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation, status with
regulators and our customers, and our business prospects. We face a number of risks related to compliance
with applicable law, including with respect to industrial accidents, which may be due to our employee’s
activities or omissions and which may constitute criminal conduct in certain circumstances. In particular,
we are exposed to the risk of sanctions under Decree 231, which provides for the liability of Italian
companies as a consequence of certain crimes committed by directors, managers and/or employees in the
interest of and to the advantage of such company.

In particular, pursuant to Decree 231, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in
Italy or abroad including, among others, bribery, money laundering, corruption (including among private
individuals), fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market abuse, certain tax violations, certain
environmental violations and workplace safety violations in our interest or for our benefit, by individuals
having a functional relationship with us at the time the relevant crime was committed, including third party
agents, partners or intermediaries, unless we were able to prove that such individuals fraudulently violated
such internal control model and it was for us impossible to avoid such violation. In such circumstances, we
may be subject to fines, confiscation of profits or legal sanctions (applied as interim measures during the
investigations), including, subject to certain conditions being met, provisional measures, the termination of
authorization, permits, licenses, concessions and financing arrangements, including facilitated financing,
suspension of our operations, or prohibitions on contracting with public authorities. Any of the foregoing
events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Decree 231 also provides that the company is exempted from liability if it can prove that it has
adopted and effectively implemented a model of organization, management and control capable of
preventing the commission of the covered offenses. The Issuer has adopted an organizational and
management model in compliance with the Decree 231 as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

However, adoption of organizational and management models does not in itself exclude the
applicability of the sanctions provided for in the Decree 231. In the event of an offense covered by the
Decree, the judicial authority is called upon to evaluate the model adopted and its implementation. If the
judicial authority considers that the adopted model was not suitable for preventing such offense, if the
model had not been effectively implemented or if there had been insufficient supervision of and
compliance with the model, the company would still be subject to sanctions, such as pecuniary fines,
suspension or revocation of licenses and permits or even disqualification from the public administration
registry and prohibition on contracting with Italian public authorities. Any of these liabilities, individually
or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We face certain risks associated with having minority shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries._**

Certain of our subsidiaries have minority shareholders who may have different interests, and any
disagreements with such minority shareholders may affect the successful implementation of our business
plans with respect to those subsidiaries. For example, 30% of the respective share capital in Guala
Closures Ukraine LLC, “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A., Guala Closures Bulgaria A.D. and Guala

51


-----

Closures BY LLC is held by certain minority shareholders who, directly or indirectly through related
parties, are also managers of those companies and may own certain rights in respect of those companies,
including intellectual property rights. While there are shareholder agreements in place for most of our
subsidiaries with minority shareholders that mitigate against such problems, any significant disagreements
between our Group management and those minority shareholders with respect to the identification and
achievement of strategic and operation objectives or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations and financial condition of those companies.

We have granted put options to minority shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries. These minority
shareholders have the right to exercise those put options in certain circumstances, such as the termination
of such shareholders managerial position without just cause, our failure to comply with the relevant
shareholders’ agreement or articles of association of the relevant subsidiary, certain change of control
circumstances or where it is not possible to validly adopt shareholder resolutions of the relevant subsidiary
in the event of a shareholders’ deadlock. If one or more put options were exercised, we would have to pay
an amount of money to the relevant shareholder or shareholders in proportion to the performance of the
relevant subsidiary and such payment could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations
and financial condition of the relevant company. In our consolidated financial statements, the potential
right of the minority shareholders to exercise their respective put option right if certain conditions are met
is recognized as a liability based on the discounted estimated value of the put option at its estimated time
of exercise. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of such liability was €28.7 million.

In addition, the presence of minority shareholders at the levels of certain operating subsidiaries that
are cash generative, such as Guala Closures Ukraine LLC and “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A.,
effectively dilutes the net income available to be upstreamed to Guala Closures International B.V. by way
of dividend as such minority shareholders are entitled to their pro rata share of such dividends and
therefore the amount of cash available to be upstreamed to the Issuer via distribution and/or dividend that
can be used to service the Issuer’s indebtedness or used to execute the Issuer’s strategy is proportionally
lower than if such subsidiaries were wholly owned.

See also “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—As of March 31, 2021, we have recorded a financial
_liability in the amount of €28.7 million in respect of a put option relating to 30% of the share capital of our_
_Ukrainian, Polish, Bulgarian and Belarusian subsidiaries”._

**_Potential future impairments of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_conditions and results of operation._**

Our goodwill is a significant asset. As at March 31, 2021, the book value of our goodwill amounted to
€505.2 million, while our total intangible assets amounted to €830.2 million. We evaluate goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually, or earlier in the case of a triggering event.
Goodwill impairment is indicated and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired when their carrying
amount exceeds their estimated recoverable amount, which is the greater of their value in use and their
fair value less cost to sell. A decrease in expected cash flows of the (group of) cash generating units,
changes in market conditions, loss of key customers and a change in our imputed cost of capital may
indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. Weakness in the global economy, including due the
prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, also may cause us to make impairment charges, which,
depending on the amounts impaired, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential re-introduction of individual currencies_**
**_within the Eurozone could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that_**
**_are euro-denominated._**

The COVID-19 pandemic and other developments in recent years in the Eurozone have had a
negative impact on economic conditions globally and in Europe. As a result, the financial markets and the
supply of credit has been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by renewed fears surrounding the
sovereign debts or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe (including Italy), the possibility of further
downgrading of, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies
and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro.

If the Eurozone debt crisis was to be repeated, it is possible that one or more countries may default on
their debt obligations or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency. If such an event
were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized market dislocation,
which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, especially as a

52


-----

substantial portion of our operations are in Europe. In addition, the departure of one or more countries
from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, among other things, exchange rate control laws. These
potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect
our trading environment or the value of the Notes and could have adverse consequences for us with
respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, because we have a substantial
amount of debt denominated in euro, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be
materially affected.

Furthermore, the Indenture will contain covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate
activities. Certain of these covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of
additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to significantly
decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by those covenants would become tighter, further restricting
our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_The Offers may entitle our customers and certain other business partners to terminate their agreements as a result_**
**_of change of control provisions._**

The Offers may result in a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Group,
including in certain leases, as employment, customer, supplier and other agreements. These counterparties
will be entitled to terminate their agreements with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their
termination rights, which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
of operations.

**_A portion of the Issuer’s outstanding ordinary shares may continue to be held by minority investors._**

Following completion of the Offers, as of June 18, 2021, SPSI owned 94.9% of the Issuer’s
outstanding ordinary shares and voting stock. Because SPSI holds less than 95% of the Issuer’s ordinary
shares and voting rights, the threshold necessary to effect a Squeeze-Out under Italian law has not been
reached as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. As a result, on June 18, 2021 SPSI commenced the
Sell-Out, which will be completed on July 8, 2021. If and until such time as such threshold is reached and
the Squeeze-Out has been completed, third-party minority shareholders will continue to hold a portion of
the Issuer’s outstanding ordinary shares and voting rights, which will also limit the amount of Collateral as
the Issuer Share Pledge will only be granted in the event that SPSI acquires, directly or indirectly, 100% of
the voting share capital of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out are legal
proceedings, which could potentially be time consuming, may be challenged by one or more minority
shareholders. We expect that these procedures could be completed by the end of July, but may take longer
if, under certain circumstances, there is a challenge to the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out by any minority
shareholder. Further, following the completion of the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out, minority
shareholders may challenge the results of such procedures before courts. The Issuer is not currently aware
of any challenge made by minority shareholders with respect to the Sell-Out and Squeeze-Out procedure.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_We will depend on payments from other Group companies and in particular its subsidiaries to make payments on_**
**_the Notes._**

While the Issuer conducts certain industrial operations of its own in Italy and owns the shares it holds
in its direct subsidiaries, repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including under the Notes, is however still
in part dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash available to the Issuer, by dividend
distributions, debt repayment, loans or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted
by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their ability to make distributions or
advance upstream loans to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including
the Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and
contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

The Indenture governing the Notes will limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur contractual
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, such limitations
are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions or adverse taxation effects. In the event that
we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. We do not expect to
have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to our_**
**_debt, including the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

Upon completion of the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness
with significant debt service requirements. As of March 31, 2021, our current and non-current financial
liabilities amounted, respectively, to €24.4 million and €504.4 million, for a total amount of €528.9 million,
and, excluding unamortized transaction costs and the put option liability in respect of non-controlling
investors and financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants, our total financial liabilities amounted to
€500.9 million. As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing our As Adjusted Total Financial
Debt would have been €525.7 million (excluding unamortized transaction costs, the put option liability in
respect of non-controlling investors and financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants).

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for you as a holder of the Notes,
including:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and our other debt and liabilities;

   - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital,
capital expenditures, acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry conditions;

   - exposing us to interest rate increases on indebtedness under the Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility and other indebtedness that we may incur;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation
to cash flow;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry;

   - restricting us from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

   - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise
equity capital in the future, and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance and results of
operation, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and
other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and
meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of
assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We may not be able to effect any such refinancings or asset
dispositions on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or we may not be permitted by the terms of
our debt instruments, including the Notes, to do so. Any of these or other consequences or events could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes.

**_Despite our significant leverage, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts_**
**_of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future,
including secured indebtedness and drawings under our €80.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Although
the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and
under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the
related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture
will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, which could lead to liquidity_**
**_constraints._**

Our ability to make scheduled interest payments when due on our indebtedness and to meet our other
debt service obligations, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, or to refinance our
debt, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to

54


-----

successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as those factors discussed in these “Risk
_Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may, among
other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit
Facility, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material
assets. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on
commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under
the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. We intend to use the Revolving Credit Facility for liquidity
and working capital purposes, and if we are unable to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility in the future
or refinance any of our other debt when needed or when it would be most beneficial to do so or if we are
unable to procure a replacement liquidity line for working capital and capital expenditure purposes, our
financial condition may be adversely affected and our ability to implement our business strategy may be
impaired and. Additionally, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross
default or cross acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient
funds to repay all of our debts, including the Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risk and shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

Following the Offering, any debt borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility, will bear interest at
variable rates, generally linked to the EURIBOR market benchmark. To the extent that the interest rates
on such indebtedness were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase,
reducing our cash flow. While we may attempt to manage this risk through entering into hedging
arrangements, there will be no requirement under the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement to procure such hedging. As a result, there can be no assurance that any current or future
hedging contracts we enter into will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of interest
rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our risk management practices and procedures will
operate successfully.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital_**
**_needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  - make certain investments;

   - engage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;

   - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

   - consolidate or merger with other entities; and

   - impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants”. The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our_
future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may
be in our interest.

In addition, we will be subject to similar and other the affirmative and negative covenants contained in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. A breach of any of those covenants or other restrictions could
result in an “event of default” under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of any event of
default under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on
acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit
Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit
Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross

55


-----

default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors
under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that
our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all
other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to
repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could
proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_As of March 31, 2021, we have recorded a financial liability in the amount of €28.7 million in respect of a put_**
**_option relating to 30% of the share capital of our Ukrainian, Polish, Bulgarian and Belarusian subsidiaries._**

The Group conducts its activity in Ukraine through its subsidiary, Guala Closures Technologia
Ukraine LLC, in Bulgaria through its subsidiary, Guala Closures Bulgaria AB, in Poland through its
subsidiary, “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A. and in Belarus through its subsidiary, Guala Closures BY
LLC. 30% of the share capital of each of such entities is owned by minority investors that are also
managers (or General Manager in respect of “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A.) of such companies.
Pursuant to certain joint shareholders’ agreements established between the minority investors and Guala
Closures International B.V., Guala Closures International B.V. granted certain put options to such
minority investors in respect of the shareholdings held by them in the relevant subsidiaries. The potential
right of the minority shareholders to exercise their put option rights if certain conditions are met is
recognized as a liability in the Issuer’s Financial Statements on the basis of the discounted estimated value
of such put option at its estimated time of exercise. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of such liability was
€28.7 million and such value is determined based on a number of parameters (equity or the five years
business plan and on certain financial market assumptions such as discounted cash flow, capitalized at the
estimated put option exercise date, net of the expected dividend yields, discounted to present value using a
credit risk-adjusted discount rate). The relevant manager is entitled to exercise the put in a number of
circumstances, including at retirement, if such manager’s position at the relevant subsidiary is terminated
without cause or a change of control in the Group which involves a local competitor of the relevant
subsidiary (or a group that operates in the relevant country) or as a result of change in a certain percentage
of the members of the board of directors of the relevant subsidiary.

If any of these put options are exercised, depending on the performance of the relevant subsidiary, we
may be required to fund a significant payment in cash to the minority investors in such subsidiary, which
could require debt financing or otherwise impact our liquidity position. See note 24 to our Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations”._

**Risks Related to the Notes and Notes Guarantees**

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture will be jointly and severally guaranteed, within 180 days from the Business Day
falling immediately after the Issue Date, on a senior basis by either (a) Guala Closures Australia Holdings
Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Australia Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Ibérica, S.A.U., Guala Closures International
B.V., Guala Closures U.K. Limited, Guala Closures México, S.A. de C.V. and Guala Closures Servicios
México, S.A. de C.V. or (b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will have
guaranteed the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as of such date. For the twelve months ended
March 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors generated 39.7% of the Group’s net revenue and 31.8% of
the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and as of March 31, 2021, represented 47.3% of the Group’s total assets
(after giving effect to consolidation adjustments). Unless an entity is a Guarantor, the Issuer’s subsidiaries
will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that
purpose. As of March 31, 2021, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer had approximately
€13.9 million in third party financial liabilities outstanding, including €9.7 million of lease liabilities
recognized under IFRS 16, all of which is expected to remain outstanding following the Refinancing. See
“—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—As of March 31, 2021, we have recorded a financial liability in the
_amount of €28.7 million in respect of a put option relating to 30% of the share capital of our Ukrainian, Polish,_
_Bulgarian and Belarusian subsidiaries” above._

Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including
lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a

56


-----

direct or indirect shareholder. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to
the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved, or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

   - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or
any Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

If any of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the relevant series of Notes incurs
additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share in any proceeds distributed in
connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of such
non-Guarantor subsidiaries ahead of the holders of the relevant Notes. While the covenant described
under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on indebtedness” contains restrictions on
the incurrence of indebtedness at the level of the relevant Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries, such
restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions and would not limit the incurrence of obligations that do
not qualify as indebtedness under the Indenture. If we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations
that are not considered indebtedness under the Indenture, including structurally senior indebtedness, the
related risks that we now face, as described above and elsewhere under “—Risk related to our indebtedness”
above, could intensify.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain additional debt that we_**
**_incur in the future may be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes in priority to the Notes._**

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from any enforcement of the
Collateral securing the Notes will be required to be applied in satisfaction of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility as well as certain additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future,
including certain hedging agreements, respectively, in priority to the repayment of any outstanding
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. As such, in the
event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, you may not be able to recover on the
Collateral if the then-outstanding liabilities under such “super priority” indebtedness are greater than the
proceeds realized in the event of any enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
obligations under the Notes are secured on a first ranking basis with security interests over the Collateral
that also secure our obligations with respect to the Super Senior Liabilities. The Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor
Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct
the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

The Security Agent may refrain from taking enforcement action unless instructed to do so in
accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If the transaction security has become enforceable in accordance with its terms and either (i) the
holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in
respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain
non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than
50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured
**Creditors”) or (ii) the creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior**
Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) wish to issue enforcement instructions they
shall deliver a copy of those instructions to the Security Agent and the other agents, trustees and hedge
counterparties.

The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions (provided they are consistent
with the enforcement principles contained in the intercreditor agreement) received from (i) the Majority

57


-----

Senior Secured Creditors; (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as
to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of
the initial enforcement notice or if the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged
within six months of the initial enforcement notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the first date
on which the Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge
**Date”); (iii) if an insolvency event (other than an insolvency event directly caused by enforcement action**
taken by or at the request or direction of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, or (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the
Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the transaction security or on the expected realization of proceeds of any enforcement of transaction
security and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions which they reasonably believe to be
consistent with the enforcement principles as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and necessary or
advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objective before the Security Agent has
received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has been
indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) from any such instructing group that it may
in its discretion require (which may be greater than that contained in the Secured Debt Documents (as
defined below)) for any cost, loss or liability (together with applicable VAT) which it may incur in
complying with those instructions.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the
voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount
of indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral consisting of the shares of any
of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Guarantee and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the
Notes and the Guarantee may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens”._

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents
or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security
Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have
agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited
remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes in the event of a default. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens”._

**_The Notes will not be initially guaranteed by the Guarantors or secured by the Collateral, and provision of the_**
**_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral is subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain other limitations._**

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed, subject to and in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, within 180 days from the Business Day falling immediately
after the Issue Date, on a senior basis by either (a) Guala Closures Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, Guala
Closures Australia Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Ibérica, S.A.U., Guala Closures International B.V., Guala
Closures U.K. Limited, Guala Closures México, S.A. de C.V. and Guala Closures Servicios México, S.A.
de C.V. or (b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will have guaranteed
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as of such date. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to
limitations under applicable laws and may be released under certain circumstances. The Notes and the
Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis (subject to the operation of the Agreed Security

58


-----

Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens) as follows: (i) within ten
Business Days of (and excluding) the date on which SPSI acquires, directly or indirectly, 100% of the
voting share capital of the Issuer, SPSI (or such other entity as elected by SPSI to be the direct parent
entity of the Issuer) will grant a share pledge in respect of the shares it owns in the Issuer; (ii) within 20
Business Days of (and excluding) the Issue Date, the Issuer shall grant a Dutch law-governed share pledge
over the shares that it holds in Guala Closures International B.V.; and (iii) within 180 days from the
Business Day falling immediately after the Issue Date, (x) each Guarantor shall grant: (a) a share pledge in
respect of its shares in the capital of each other Guarantor owned by it, to the extent it is wholly owned;
and (b) a receivables security assignment in respect of material, structural, long-term, documented
receivables owed to it by any other Guarantor, which in the case of Mexican Guarantors will be
documented via a non-possessory pledge agreement limited to such receivables; and (y) Guala Closures
International B.V. will grant a pledge over the shares it holds in “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A. There
can, however, be no assurance that we will be successful in granting such guarantees or procuring such
liens within the time periods specified. Furthermore, Guala Closures Me´xico, S.A. de C.V. and Guala
Closures Servicios Me´xico, S.A. de C.V. (the “Mexican Guarantors”), which generated 8.0% of the
Group’s net revenue and 10.0% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31,
2021 and, as of March 31, 2021, represented 8.8% of the Group’s total assets (after giving effect to
consolidation adjustments), are party to the BBVA Bancomer Facility Agreements as described under
“Description of Other Indebtedness—BBVA Bancomer Facility Agreements”, which contain certain financial
covenants and otherwise limit the ability of the Mexican Guarantors to incur certain indebtedness
or guarantees. As a result, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes Guarantees of the
Mexican Guarantors may be required to be limited to an amount that would not cause a default under the
BBVA Bancomer Facility Agreements or the Mexican Guarantors may not be required to provide Notes
Guarantees or Collateral.

**_The Notes offered hereby will be effectively subordinated to certain creditors who benefit from security over certain_**
**_assets that will not be pledged as collateral for the Notes._**

While the Indenture will provide for a negative pledge, it will allow the Issuer and our restricted
subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, to incur secured indebtedness that will be effectively senior to
the Notes to the extent of the value of the assets that secure that indebtedness. In particular, as of
March 31, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, €4.2 million under the BBVA Bancomer
Facility Agreements of other debt secured on assets of the Mexican Guarantors that do not constitute
Collateral and the Yes bank loans and facilities will remain outstanding. In the event of any distribution or
payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration,
reorganization, or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, the proceeds from the sale of assets securing
any secured indebtedness will only be available to discharge other indebtedness, including the Notes, once
such secured claims have been paid in full. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less, rateably, than
holders of our other future indebtedness secured over assets other than the Collateral.

**_The providers of the security interests securing the Notes will have control over the Collateral._**

The Transaction Security Documents will allow the relevant provider of the security interest securing
the Notes to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and
dispose of any income from, the relevant Collateral. So long as no “default” or “event of default” under
the Indenture would result therefrom, the relevant security provider, may, among other things, and subject
to the terms of the applicable Transaction Security Document, without any release or consent by the
Security Agent or the Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to certain of the Collateral
such as selling or otherwise disposing of such Collateral.

Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts
payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on
the Collateral.

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral on the
relevant dates described under “Description of the Notes—Security”. The Collateral may also secure
additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility and the
Intercreditor Agreement either on a pari passu basis or junior basis. Your rights to the Collateral may be
diluted by any increase in debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the
Notes.

59


-----

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions,
defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral
securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral
will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale,
economic conditions where operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the
Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the
Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure
you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not
be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that
entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in more than one
country, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit the realizable
value of the Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the
various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of
rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and
duration of the proceedings.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of
priority security interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are
first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security
Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be
affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent may be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in Collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the
consent of a third party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that the
Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets, including interaction
with other shareholders of the relevant companies. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the
ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may decline significantly.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be_**
**_released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral will be released automatically, including among others:

  - as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”;

   - in connection with any sale or other disposition of property or assets constituting Collateral (other
than the pledge of the Issuer’s share capital, if granted), if the sale or other disposition does not
violate the “Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” covenant or other applicable
provisions under the Indenture;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or defeasance or
discharge of the Notes, as provided under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and “Description
_of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

   - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) or
certain other transactions not prohibited by the Indenture;

  - upon achievement of the conditions described under “—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants and Release of Security Interests on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”; and_

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement, or
otherwise in accordance with the Indenture.

See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens”.

-----

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Collateral may be released and retaken
including connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes. In certain
jurisdictions, including Italy and Poland, such a release and retaking of collateral may give rise to the start
of a new hardening period in respect of the Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors,
insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the
grant of the Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of
the Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_Your rights in the Collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests_**
**_in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the
grantor of the security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to
the claims of the Notes if we are not required to take any relevant actions as a result of the Agreed
Security Principles or if we fail or are unable to take the actions we are required to take to perfect any of
these liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral
securing the Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against
third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the
same Collateral. The Security Agent will not have any obligation to take any action or steps of any kind to
perfect any of these liens.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Notes Guarantees will_**
**_be released automatically, without your consent or any action on the part of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantee will terminate and release automatically,
including, among others:

   - in connection with any disposition of a Guarantor that does not violate the Indenture, Intercreditor
Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement;

   - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary or any event occurs after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes or
defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and
“Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

   - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary (as defined under “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Definitions”), so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the_
extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with
respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility or
Public Debt (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) at the time;

   - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
additional intercreditor agreement;

  - as may be permitted by the provision described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and
_Waivers”;_

   - upon the release of the guarantee of the other indebtedness that triggered the grant of the relevant
Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described below under “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”; and_

   - as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited by the covenant described under
“Description of the Notes—Merger and Consolidation”, a Permitted Reorganization and certain other
transactions not prohibited by the Indenture.

**_Enforcement of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may be difficult and involve long recovery times._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy, the Guarantors are incorporated or organized (as
applicable) under the laws of Australia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Scotland and Spain and the Collateral

61


-----

will be governed by the laws of Australia, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, Scotland, Spain and Poland, as
applicable. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any
of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of a future Guarantor. Your
rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and will thus be subject to the laws of a
number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically
complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of
creditors’ rights.

The bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the Issuer’s jurisdiction of organization,
the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of each of the Guarantors and the jurisdictions the laws of
which govern the security interest in the Collateral may be materially different from, or conflict with, each
other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of creditors’ rights, priority of creditors,
the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application
of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should
apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes and to realize any
recovery under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral securing
the Notes give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the
Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes
priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the
Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors
(including unsecured creditors) on such Collateral.

Furthermore, the Collateral will consist of a pledge over the shares of the Issuer (only if SPSI
acquires, directly or indirectly, 100% of the voting share capital of the Issuer), and pledges over shares and
other capital stock and certain structural intercompany receivables of the Guarantors and the shares and
other capital stock owned by the Group in “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A. In connection with the
enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt obligations, any sale of such
entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which could result in a taxable
capital gain to such entities. The Indenture will not prohibit the Guarantors from incurring additional debt
claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledges over the shares of the applicable
Guarantors may result in the release of the debt obligations of the relevant Guarantor. Such release is
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital
gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge.

**_It is possible that some of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be enforceable._**

In certain jurisdictions, the creation of security interests to secure the obligations of a third party may
be limited under applicable law. As a result, enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes in certain
jurisdictions may be subject to certain statutory limitations or defenses or to limitations contained in the
terms of the Transaction Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory
requirements. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for a more detailed description of the various_
limitations on the security in each relevant jurisdiction.

In addition, under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and
indicated in the relevant security document. Due to the difficulty of clearly identifying and keeping track of
the names of the individual holder of the Notes over time, there might be the risk that beneficial owners of
the Notes who are not identified as beneficial owners in the Italian collateral may not be able to validly
enforce the security. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all noteholders_**
**_with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the outstanding Notes._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider
matters affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders of
_Notes”, the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of noteholders will be one_
or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding

62


-----

Notes. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%) to bind all holders of the Notes, including
noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and noteholders who voted in a manner
contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may
include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or
interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or
reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the
quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or the majority required to pass a resolution, and change
the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact noteholders’ rights and may
have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an
extraordinary resolution amending the economic terms and conditions of the Notes typically requires the
consent of not less than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision
to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the
Notes, the Issuer and/or others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the
consequence that the majority voting threshold is be reduced from 75% to 50%.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on the Issuer’s_**
**_indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as
amended and supplemented) allows for the full tax deductibility for Italian corporate income tax of
interest expenses incurred by an Italian company in each fiscal year up to the amount of the interest
income of the same fiscal year, as evidenced by the relevant annual financial statements. A further
deduction of interest expenses in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of fiscal
EBITDA (i.e. risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”) determined according to the
tax rules for the calculation of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL and of interest
income exceeding the interest expenses not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expenses in a
fiscal year can be carried forward, respectively, for the following five fiscal years and without time limits.
Interest expenses not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years
and deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expenses
that exceeds interest income is lower than 30% of ROL (utilized on the basis of the FIFO method). The
carried forward ROL determined according to accounting rules under the previously applicable limitation
provision could be offset only with interest expenses incurred on loans granted before June 17, 2016, to the
extent that their maturity and their total amount committed have not been changed as of that date. In the
case of a tax group, interest expenses not deducted by an entity within the tax group due to lack of ROL
can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies within
the tax group.

Based on the above rules, the Issuer (or the Group) may not be able to deduct for Italian tax purposes
all interest expenses borne in each relevant fiscal year. Furthermore, any future changes in Italian tax laws
or in their interpretation or application, including any possible further limitation to the use of the ROL of
the Issuer and/or of the Group may result in the Issuer’s inability to fully deduct its interest expenses or
further reduce the amount which it can deduct.

In addition, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout
transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition
financing. On March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E clarifying, as a
common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in LBO transactions are generally deductible
for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in art. 96 Presidential Decree no.917 of
December 22, 1986. The Circular Letter also indicates that shareholder loans may be re-characterized as
capital contributions. Such re-characterization has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, based on the
economic circumstances of the borrowing Issuer and under the substance-over-form approach as provided
by OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The re-characterization provides that the: (i) interest incurred on
any former or future shareholder loans are not deductible and (ii) interest payments made in respect of
said shareholder loans may be subject to withholding tax on dividends.

In addition, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would
not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any
financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and
conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing
transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest
expenses arising from such financing does not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the

63


-----

relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as such not compliant with the “inherence”
principle set out under Italian tax law). Italian tax laws and pronouncements of the tax authorities are
subject to change and positions that the Group takes for tax purposes may be challenged. In the past the
Group has faced tax audits and investigations in respect of its financing which had resulted in the payment
of fines by the Issuer.

Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including
any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the tax treatment of
interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable
legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense or (iii) a change in the interpretation
and application by Italian tax authorities of Italian tax law may result in our inability to fully deduct our
interest expense, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the
Offering to make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle, we may be unable to fully deduct our
interest expenses or be subject to significant penalties or other consequences that could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise
make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes generally will not be entitled to a gross-up for any Italian withholding taxes, unless the Italian_**
**_withholding tax is caused by a failure of the Issuer to comply with certain procedures._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is Italian resident for tax purposes and therefore
payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will
be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments in respect of the Notes will be made free and
clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is required by
law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will
result in the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts as they would have received in respect of such
Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required. The Issuer is not liable to pay any additional
amounts to holders of the Notes under certain circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is
required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (“Decree 239”) or pursuant to
Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree 461”), except where the procedures required
under Decree 239 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due to the actions or
omissions of the Issuer or its agents. In such circumstances, investors subject to Italian withholding tax will
only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes” and “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian tax considerations”._

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree
239 or Decree 461 where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country or territory which
allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian tax authorities as contained (I) as at the
date of this Offering Memorandum in the Ministerial Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance of
September 4, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time and replaced, (the “White List”), or
(II) once effective, in any other decree or regulation that will be issued in the future under Article 11(4)(c)
of Decree 239 to provide the list of such countries and territories (the “New White List”), including any
country or territory that will be deemed listed therein for the purpose of any interim rule and such holder
complies with certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover,
holders of Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree 239 or Decree 461 after the date hereof,
including any change in the White List (or the New White List once effective). Holders of the Notes
resident in such countries or territories but that do not satisfy the conditions set forth by Decree 239 (as
amended or supplemented) or Decree 461 (as amended or supplemented), as well as certain categories of
holders of the Notes who are resident in Italy, will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the
Notes. The regime provided by Decree 239 and Decree 461 and in particular the exemption from imposta
_sostitutiva, which is in principle granted to holders of the Notes resident in countries that allow for_
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, is also subject to certain procedural requirements being
met. Should the procedural requirements not be met, Italian imposta sostitutiva may apply on the
payments of any interest under the Notes to foreign investors resident in countries that allow for
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian tax
_considerations”._

64


-----

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements to apply the Italian tax regime provided by Italian_**
**_Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 in respect of the Notes will be met by the relevant foreign_**
**_intermediaries._**

The regime provided by Decree 239 and in particular the exemption from withholding tax in principle
granted to holders of the Notes resident in countries included in the White List (or in the New White List
once it is effective) applies if certain procedural requirements are met. It is not possible to assure that all
non-Italian resident investors can claim the application of the withholding tax exemption where the
relevant foreign intermediary fails to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities
under the procedures set for applying the exemption regime. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_Italian tax considerations”._

**_The ability of our Group’s operating subsidiaries to upstream dividends for debt service is reduced by the presence_**
**_of minority shareholders or will result in leakage._**

The Issuer is dependent upon distributions from operating subsidiaries in the form of intragroup loan
payments of interest and principle, service arrangements and dividend distributions in order to service its
debt, including the Notes. However, due to the presence of minority shareholders at various operating
companies and sub-holding subsidiaries, including Guala Closures Ukraine LLC, “Guala Closures DGS
Poland” S.A., Guala Closures Bulgaria A.D. and Guala Closures BY LLC, dividends upstreamed from
such entities will result in dividend leakage as the minority shareholders of the various subsidiaries will
receive their pro rata share of dividends, reducing the amounts received by Guala Closures International
B.V., our main international holding company, and therefore available for debt service at the level of the
Issuer and/or to fund continuing operations.

**_The Notes Guarantees of the Guarantors may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or_**
**_defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each of their Notes Guarantees will be
limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of
each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s
corporate interests, the burden of such Notes Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor,
such guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general
statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and/
or incur civil or criminal liability.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be
subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in
the terms of the Notes Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable
to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation
of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a
Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law
applicable to it.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a
bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on
any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited
or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to
that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables
of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

Furthermore, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes Guarantees of the
Mexican Guarantors may be required to be limited to an amount that would not cause a default under the
BBVA Bancomer Facility Agreements or the Mexican Guarantors may not be required to provide Notes
Guarantees or Collateral. See “—The Notes will not be initially guaranteed by the Guarantors or secured by
_the Collateral, and provision of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral is subject to the Agreed Security_
_Principles and certain other limitations” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—The BBVA Bancomer_
_Facility Agreements.”_

-----

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Notes
Guarantees, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for additional important information._

**_The grant of collateral to secure the Notes might be challenged or voidable in an insolvency proceeding._**

The grant of collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee,
liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is
deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a
greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the
grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that
the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the relevant series of Notes would lose the benefit of
the relevant security interest. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and
_the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

Further, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security
interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the
Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the
non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified
period (the “suspect period”). In this regard, a longer period might apply to any collateral governed by
Italian law which be granted after the Offering. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the
debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value
(i.e. to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the
consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g. payment in kind) or
security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of
knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action,
(ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of
knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action during the
suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and
payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the
secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency,
whereby the insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of
the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw back action.

Under Article 64 of Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”),
all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the
two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In
addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules
of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU.

If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be
able to recover any amounts under the related Transaction Security Documents.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent or, in Italy, in favor of the Security Agent
acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article
2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. The Indenture will provide, along with the Intercreditor
Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on
behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may not have
direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of the
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral and in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement.

66


-----

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken,
including Italian law. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow the direct appropriation
of certain pledged assets but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply.
There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdiction as to whether obligations to beneficial
owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security
document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of
certain jurisdiction (including the Republic of Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other
jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such
security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations
in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any
Guarantor owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable
(“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests will be granted to the
Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal
Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in
the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of
the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of
the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security
interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests
and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the
Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities
and bond issuances, has not been tested under certain of these jurisdictions (including under Italian law),
and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct
are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

The Collateral governed by Italian law will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will
be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting also in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil
Code. Under such provision (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and
guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of
a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the
name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial
proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available
case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a
_rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on_
behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically
identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

**_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests in_**
**_accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby
may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security interest has been
granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were
to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness or the assignment
of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable
hardening period may run from the moment such new security is amended, granted or perfected. If the
security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable
in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See
also “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

The Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will provide that the collateral securing the Notes
may be released and retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the

67


-----

Notes. In Italy and certain other jurisdictions such as Poland, such a release and retaking of collateral may
give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of the applicable collateral.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you_**
**_as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer, and within 180
days from the Business Day immediately after the Issue Date will be guaranteed by the relevant
Guarantors. The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and the relevant Guarantors are incorporated
or organized (as applicable) under the laws of Australia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Scotland and Spain.
The Collateral will be governed by the laws of these jurisdictions, as well as Poland. In the event of
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under
the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of
jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency
and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi- jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and
costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’
rights.

The insolvency, administration and other similar laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not
be as favorable to you as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar,
including in the areas of creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest
and the duration of insolvency proceedings. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and
provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory
provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than
the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a result, enforcement
of rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and
be complex and costly for creditors.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments
obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer and
the enforceability of a Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests
in the Collateral, including the pledge to be granted over the shares of the Issuer upon acquisition by SPSI
(or such entity as elected by SPSI to be the direct parent of the Issuer) of 100% of the voting share capital
of the Issuer (the “Security Interests”). A court may also, in certain circumstances, avoid the security
interests and/or guarantee, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, where the relevant
company providing the security interests and/or guarantee, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security
Interests, is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and
insolvency law is only a brief overview and describes certain generally applicable terms and principles
which are defined under and subject to the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency
statutes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such
limitations and considerations.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany
obligations generally, as preferences, transactions at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the
Security Interests provided by such security provider;

   - direct that holders of the Notes return any amount paid under a guarantee or any security interest
in the Collateral, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, to the relevant

68


-----

Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s
creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes and any Notes Guarantee or Security
Interest is found to be preferences, transactions at an undervalue, a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is
otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the
Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Notes Guarantee or the
Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or Security
Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being
set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and the Collateral under the Security Documents
will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making
a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire guarantee,
including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, may be set aside, in which case the entire
liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Notes Guarantees were issued, or Security Interests
created, the Guarantors or security provider:

   - knew or should have known that the transaction was to the detriment of the creditors;

   - issued such Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interests with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over
others;

   - issued such Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interests in a situation where a prudent
businessman, as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider, would have contributed
equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Notes
Guarantee or Security Interests knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider
was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made;

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the relevant
Notes Guarantee or Security Interests, on the basis that the relevant Notes Guarantee or Security
Interests were incurred or created for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security
provider’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Notes Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became
insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for
which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to
incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when
they would become due;

   - the Notes Guarantee or Security Interest was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor
or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor
or security provider; or

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law.

The criteria on which insolvency is evaluated differs between jurisdictions, but a Guarantor or security
provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a guarantee
or created a security interests if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

   - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

   - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining
whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Notes Guarantees were issued
or the Security Interests were created that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor or a security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or a security provider was insolvent on the date its

Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

The interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. Our
shareholders may have an interest in pursuing divestitures or other transactions that in their judgment
could enhance their investment, though such transactions may not enhance the value of the Notes or your
position as a creditor.

Following completion of the Offers, as of June 18, 2021, SPSI, a vehicle indirectly held by
Investindustrial and certain other Co-investors, held 94.9% of the Issuer’s share capital and voting rights,
and is our controlling shareholder. In addition, SPSI’s ownership interest in the Issuer may increase
following the completion of the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out. See “The Transactions” and “Principal
_Shareholders”. Furthermore, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, eight out of nine members of_
the Issuer’s board of directors were drawn from the slate filed by SPSI. See “Management”. As a result,
SPSI and Investindustrial have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect the
Group’s legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change the Group’s management and
to approve other changes to the Group’s operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring
action by the shareholders. The interest of SPSI and Investindustrial may conflict with your interests as
holders of the Notes. SPSI may have their own respective interests in paying dividends or pursuing other
transactions related to their equity stake in the Issuer that, in their judgement could enhance their
investment, though such transactions may not enhance the value of the Notes or your position as a
creditor.

Investindustrial is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold,
directly or through its affiliates, interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Group.
Investindustrial and its affiliates, including SPSI, may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are
complementary to the Group’s business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to the Group. In addition, Investindustrial and its affiliates, including SPSI, may hold interests in
our suppliers or our clients. Investindustrial and its affiliates, including SPSI, could also have an interest in
pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of the Group’s business
or sales of the Issuer’s shares which would result in changes to the Issuer’s shareholding structure),
financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity
investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the
currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may
be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro
against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could
cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a
loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such
investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency
other than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign
exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”._

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by
the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any
given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, downgrade or withdrawal

70


-----

at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value
and trading of the Notes.

**_We may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase your Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the_**
**_Indenture. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding_**
**_Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” of
the relevant Issuer. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer is
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that
the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding
Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement or other
then-existing contractual obligations of the Issuer would allow the Issuer to make such required
repurchases. A change of control may result in an obligation to mandatorily prepay and cancel all or part
of the Revolving Credit Facility, an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Revolving Credit
Facility, and other indebtedness or trigger a similar obligation to offer to repurchase loans or notes
thereunder. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such
indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of
control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. If an event constituting a “change of
control” (as defined in the Indenture) occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited, under certain
financing arrangements or otherwise, from repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the
creditors under such indebtedness to the purchase of Notes or may attempt to refinancing the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will
remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require
third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure
you that we would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the
Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other
indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other
similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership. Except as described under “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain a provision that requires us to offer to_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or
similar transaction. Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a
change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if a specified
consolidated net leverage ratio is met. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”.

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes (with certain exceptions) a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole
to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”,
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a
whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer
is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. In addition, a change of control will not be deemed
to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such
event.

In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw the Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have

71


-----

the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at
a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer (excluding any early tender
fee). See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_Transfers of the Notes are restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws of the United States as well as any other jurisdiction. The
Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities
laws or any other jurisdiction. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes in the United States except
pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement, and
you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. The
Notes and the Indenture governing the Notes contain provisions that restrict the Notes from being offered,
sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or other exemptions under the U.S. Securities Act. In addition,
by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any
investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of less than €100,000. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other
country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the
United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and each of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the
United States, and our business is conducted entirely outside the United States. Almost all of the directors
and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States.

Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain courts in New York
in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to
effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and
the Guarantors. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their
respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United
States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in
light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be
subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Enforcement
_of Civil Liabilities”._

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the global notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form, or definitive registered notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in
very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners of the Notes. The
nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the
global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in
respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or, if applicable, from

72


-----

a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will
be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “event of default” under the Indenture, unless and until
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

   - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The trading market for the Notes may attract
different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The liquidity of a trading
market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and
is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will
be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes,
regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there may not be an active trading
market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a
fair value, if at all.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future, which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange upon their issuance, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become, or remain listed. If
the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Issuer can no longer maintain such listing
or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or
maintain such listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, provided, however, that it
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another
recognized stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.

In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing the
Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange in
accordance with the Indenture, failure to obtain approval for the listing or the delisting of the Notes from
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange, as applicable,
may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive
two of the following ratings: “BBB-” or better from S&P, “Baa3” or better from Moody’s or “BBB-” or
better from Fitch, and no event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day until the
reversion date, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the relevant Notes. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”. If these_
covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make
payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such
rating will be maintained.

**_Holders may be required to provide information under OECD Common Reporting Standard._**

The EU Savings Directive adopted on June 3, 2003, by the EU Council of Economic and Finance
Ministers (as subsequently amended) on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments has
been repealed from January 1, 2016 to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Directive and the new
automatic exchange of information regime implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on
Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU).

Drawing extensively on the intergovernmental approach to implementing the United States Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to address
the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for
financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of
financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting
financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual basis, financial
information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of
common due diligence and reporting procedures.

Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and
the amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated
December 28, 2015, which has entered into force on January 1, 2016, implemented Law 95/2015 and
provides for the exchange of information in relation to the calendar year 2016 and subsequent years. In the
event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as meant in the
Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be required to
provide additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the
Italian implementation of the CRS.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”, such change in the Issuer could result in a taxable
exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders (as
defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would recognize
any gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed) and
would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
addition, if the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the IPO pushdown is less than the principal
amount of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated
as issued with OID. Please see “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”._

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or
equal to a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued with OID
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) generally will be required to include such OID in gross income as_
ordinary income as it accrues on a constant yield basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally in
advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of such U.S.
Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Offers**

On December 8, 2020, SPSI and its direct parent, SPSH, entered into certain Co-Investment
Agreements with the Co-Investors. In addition, on December 8, 2020, SPSI entered into the Adherence
Agreement, pursuant to which Space Holding S.r.l. undertook (also for its partners) to tender 3,656,250
ordinary shares (equal to 5.2% of the fully diluted share capital of the Issuer and 4.6% of the fully diluted
voting rights exercisable in shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer) in the Mandatory Offer.

On March 25, 2021, SPSI announced the launch of the Mandatory Offer on the ordinary shares of the
Issuer as it had met the relevant legal conditions pursuant to Articles 102 and 106 of the Italian Financial
Act by holding a total amount of 33,493,940 ordinary shares representing 49.9% of the Issuer’s share
capital, and 44.6% of the voting rights exercisable at the shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer, equivalent to
47.8% of the fully diluted share capital of the Issuer and 42.6% of the fully diluted voting rights exercisable
at the shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer.

On May 8, 2021, SPSI published the Offer Document, which was approved by CONSOB on May 6,
2021. The Mandatory Offer was then launched in respect of all of the ordinary shares of the Issuer net of
the 33,493,940 ordinary shares already held by SPSI, consisting of 32,212,276 ordinary shares, representing
46.0% of the fully diluted share capital of the Issuer and 40.9% of the fully diluted voting rights exercisable
at the shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer. In addition, following conversion of 4,322,438 Class B special
shares into ordinary shares during the Offer Period, the Mandatory Offer was increased to up to
36,534,714 ordinary shares, representing 52.2% of the share capital of the Issuer and the fully diluted
voting rights exercisable at the shareholders’ meeting of the Issuer.

SPSI also announced the launch the Voluntary Offer pursuant to Article 102 of the Italian Financial
Act, in respect of the Market Warrants listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato Telematico
_Azioniario) net of the 6,769,340 Market Warrants already held by SPSI, consisting of 12,598,053 Market_
Warrants.

The Offers remained open from May 18, 2021 until June 7, 2021 and settled on June 14, 2021. SPSI
paid €8.20 per ordinary share tendered in the Mandatory Offer and €0.30 per Market Warrant tendered in
the Voluntary Offer. Following completion of the Mandatory Offer on June 14, 2021, SPSI held a total
amount of 66.478.903 ordinary shares representing 94.9% of the Issuer’s share capital and voting rights. In
addition, following completion of the Voluntary Offer, SPSI held 16.809.156 Market Warrants,
representing 86.8% of the Issuer’s total Market Warrants.

**The Sell-Out, Squeeze-Out and Delisting**

As a result of SPSI holding more than 90% and less than 95% of Guala’s share capital, pursuant to
Article 108, paragraph 2 of the Italian Finance Law and taking into account that the purpose of the
Mandatory Offer was to achieve the Delisting of Guala, on June 11, 2021, SPSI announced the Sell-Out,
pursuant to which it would purchase shares from any minority shareholders at a price of €8.20 per ordinary
share tendered making a request to such effect. The Sell-Out commenced on June 18, 2021 and will be
completed on July 8, 2021. If, as a result of the Sell-Out, SPSI comes to own at least 95% of the share
capital of Guala, SPSI will then commence the Squeeze-Out pursuant to Article 111, paragraph 1 of the
Italian Finance Law. Following completion of the Sell-Out, the Delisting will occur. Upon completion of
the Sell-Out and the Delisting, the Market Warrants will no longer be exercisable by their respective
holders, except in case of re-listing of the Issuer’s ordinary shares on the Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato
_Telematico Azioniario)._

**The Refinancing**

As a result of the Offers, the results of which were announced by SPSI on June 7, 2021, the change of
control provision in our Existing Notes was triggered and the Issuer will be required in accordance with the
provisions of the indenture governing the Existing Notes to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes
to repurchase any or all of their Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount of such Existing Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, unless the
Issuer elects to redeem all of the outstanding Existing Notes at par prior to the date on which the Issuer is
required to make such an offer. There is committed financing in place in order to fund the redemption, if
required. The Issuer intends to redeem the Existing Notes in full using a portion of the proceeds from the
Offering.

In addition, the change of control provision in our Existing Revolving Credit Facility was triggered
and lenders representing €67 million of commitments thereunder have agreed to waive their right to
request the full repayment of outstanding amounts and cancel their commitments thereunder. On April 26,
2021, we cancelled €13 million of commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and repaid
€2.7 million of outstanding amounts thereunder that were owed to lenders that did not waive their right to
request the repayment of outstanding amounts thereunder. We also made a repayment of €0.35 million on
May 24, 2021 and a repayment of €0.25 million on June 7, 2021. As a result of the above, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility has a total aggregate amount of
€67 million and an aggregate principal amount outstanding of €13.6 million.

We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the Offering to redeem the Existing Notes and pay
accrued interest thereon, and repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. See also “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization”. In
connection with the Transactions, we will cancel the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and will enter into
the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility”.

Existing Notes and pay accrued interest thereon, repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility, including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and pay fees and expenses associated
with the Refinancing.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses. Actual amounts will vary from
estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the amount of interest expense due on the

**Overview**

We believe that we are the world’s leading producer of high value added closures for the spirits and
wine industry. Through ongoing development and technological innovation, we believe that we are the top
producer of non-refillable safety closures for the spirits industry with a market share by volume of units
sold worldwide of more than 60%, the leading global producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures
with a market share by volume of units sold of approximately 30%, and Europe’s largest producer of rollon aluminum closures for wine, spirits and olive oil, in each case, in 2019. In aggregate, as of March 31,
2021, we operated from 30 production facilities, five research and development centers and three sales
centers across 25 countries in five continents, and we produced and sold approximately 17 billion closures
across than 300 models and in more than 100 countries in 2020.

Our product lines include: Safety closures, Luxury closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine
closures. We serve customers in several geographies and across four key end-markets: Spirits, Wine, Water
and Beverages, and Oil and Condiments.

IFRS, but have been prepared on the basis of IFRS amounts, and should not be considered as an
alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to recurring
profit from operations, income from operations or net income as indicators of our operating performance
or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are used by different
companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those
companies. You should exercise caution in comparing EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported
by us to EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of other companies.

-----

We believe that EBIT and EBITDA is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our
indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us.
We believe that Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant measures for assessing our
performance because they are adjusted for certain items which, we believe, are not indicative of our
underlying operating performance and thus aid in an understanding of profit.

We define EBIT as profit (loss) before taxation and financial income and expense as shown in our
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The most directly reconcilable line item is Profit. In
evaluating EBIT, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, EBIT is subject to certain limitations. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other financial measures”. The following is a
reconciliation of Profit to EBIT for the periods indicated:

us and are not recognized measures under IFRS. Although we do not believe that these measures are a
substitute for IFRS measures in light of the significant translation effects of movements in exchange rates
due to the international nature of the Group’s business, we believe that computing Net revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA results for any given period at constant exchange rates is the most appropriate means
to compare our current results of operations against the previous year. Non-IFRS measures may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the our operating results as reported
under IFRS.

Net Working Capital refers to inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables. Net Capital
Expenditure refers to Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less Proceeds
from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Net Working Capital and Net Capital Expenditure are not measures of liquidity under IFRS or U.S.
GAAP and have limitations as an analytical tool, some of which include that they do not deduct cash flows
used in other financing activities, and they do not deduct certain other items settled in cash. Such measures
should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our
business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Other companies in the
industries in which we operate may calculate Net Working Capital and Net Capital Expenditure, or other
similarly titled measures differently than us, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

**Factors affecting the comparability of operations**

**_Transactions in 2018_**

On July 31, 2018, following the 2018 Business Combination, Space4, acquired a 67% stake in
pre-merger Guala and BU Lux, the business unit of GCL, and on August 6, 2018, pre-merger Guala
merged by incorporation into Space4. On December 12, 2018, through its Luxembourg subsidiary GCL
International S.à r.l., the Group completed the purchase of Guala Closures UCP. As a result of the above,
the Issuer’s income statement and statement of cash flows information for the year ended December 31,
2018 include seven months of operations of Space 4, prior to the business combination with pre-merger
Guala, and five months of operations of the Group. The financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was restated to reflect the effects of the completion of the purchase price accounting
related to the following business combinations: (i) the Group from the date of the 2018 Acquisition
(July 31, 2018) and (ii) Guala Closures UCP from the date of acquisition (December 12, 2018). The
financial effects of the purchase price accounting included in non-recurring expense related to: (i) the fair
value recognition of inventories at July 31, 2018 and (ii) the gain from the net assets acquired as part of the
Guala Closures UCP business combination compared to the consideration transferred. The financial
effects ceased in 2018. See note 6.1 to the 2019 Audited Financial Statements for further information on
the 2018 Business Combinations, the Guala Closures UCP business combination and the purchase price
accounting in connection therewith. As a result, given the impact of the 2018 Business Combinations and

**_Changes to Accounting Standards_**

_Application of IFRS 16_

The Issuer has applied IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. The application of IFRS 16 increased
our current and non-current financial liabilities as a result of the recognition of €17.0 million in lease
liabilities. Other operating expenses decreased by €5.4 million from the reduction in lease liabilities due to
the application of IFRS 16, while financial expenses in respect of lease liabilities increased by €0.1 million.
The application of IFRS 16 had a positive effect of €5.4 million on Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The application of IFRS 16 contributed to €5.8 million in amortization and
depreciation for the same year. The reclassification of the finance lease assets that were recognized as
property, plant and equipment under IAS 17 in previous years and now recognized as “right-of-use assets”
under IFRS 16, which has replaced IAS 17, resulted in a decrease of property, plant and equipment by
€12.2 million. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Changes to Accounting
_Standards—Application of IFRS 16” and note 2(c) “Changes in accounting standards” to the 2019 Financial_
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Acquisitions, divestments and other transactions affecting our scope of consolidation and comparability of our_**
**_results of operations_**

During the periods under review, we completed several acquisitions, divestments and other
transactions through which we changed the size of our operations and which enabled us to expand into
new geographical markets and product markets. In general, such transaction impact the comparability of
our results of operations from period to period. In addition, following an acquisition, we may be required
to, or may elect to, make significant investments in the acquired assets or companies.

The following is a description of the key acquisitions, divestments and other transactions completed
during the periods under review.

   - In February 2021, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. subscribed a capital
increase of its associate SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based
in London and focusing on integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions,
for an amount of £1.4 million (equivalent to €1.6 million), increasing the Group’s investment in
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd to 30% of its fully diluted share capital. As the company is associated
with the Group, it does not fall within the scope of full consolidation.

  - In September 2020, the German company Guala Closures Deutschland finalized the acquisition of
the investment in Guala Closures Turkey as part of the Closurelogic business, after certain
previously-agreed conditions were met.

   - The investment in GCL Pharma S.r.l. was sold in April 2020.

   - In February 2020, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalized the subscription
of a 20% interest in the fully diluted share capital of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd.

   - In February 2020, our German subsidiary, Guala Closures Deutschland, acquired the assets of
Closurelogic, a German manufacturer specialized in the production of aluminum closures mainly
for beverages and mineral water in glass bottles.

   - In January 2020, the Group acquired a non-controlling interest in Guala Closures France S.a.s. via
capital increase.

   - Guala Closures East Africa’s new facility was officially inaugurated in Kenya in November 2019 and
the company was set up to provide spirits producers in Kenya and the wider east African market
with anti-counterfeiting closures featuring the latest technologies.

   - In January 2019, Guala Closures India Pvt Ltd paid €0.6 million as Axiom’s contingent
consideration, as originally set out in the 2017 acquisition contract and in April 2019, Guala
Closures India merged Axiom Propack.

   - In June 2019, Guala Closures Iberica’s assets were transferred to Guala Closures UCP. In addition,
in 2019, the remaining assets were sold to third parties and Guala Closures Iberica’s PET facility in
Alcalà De Henares (Madrid) was definitively closed.

   - In June 2019, the Dutch subsidiary Guala Closures International B.V. approved the establishment
of a new company in Belarus. The new Minsk facility commenced operations in 2019, continuing
the development project to better serve the greater Russian market.

**Principal factors affecting our results of operations**

**_General macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

We are impacted by global economic conditions, including in consumer spending resulting from,
among other factors, reduced consumer confidence, falling gross domestic product, rising unemployment
rates and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Since early 2020, the worldwide outbreak of
COVID-19 and the consequent restrictive measures implemented by the public authorities of the affected
countries has had an enormous social impact and a significant impact on general economic performance
and on consumption and investments, leading to general uncertainty. We acted immediately to implement
all actions necessary to minimize the social and occupational health and safety and financial impacts by
defining and implementing flexible and timely action plans. From the outset, we worked tirelessly to ensure
the utmost health and safety for our employees, customers and suppliers. We immediately implemented a
series of protective measures for our personnel, investing in personal protective equipment to ensure that
activities are carried out in accordance with best practices in terms of occupational safety.

Our priority is and will remain ensuring the safety of our employees and business continuity. We
quickly and responsibly took all steps and safety measures identified by the authorities in the various
markets, introducing new protocols, work practices and safety precautions. These safety and prevention
measures introduced at the onset of the pandemic remain in place and are continuously updated to comply
with the new directives issued by the competent authorities. We also liaise continuously key business
partners such as suppliers and customers has been further ramped up with the aim of ensuring business
continuity. Specific business continuity plans have been prepared with our key customers. In addition to
the measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as the distribution of disposable masks and
gloves, social distancing between workers, measuring body temperature when entering the workplace and
the sanitisation of all premises every two weeks, we entered into a COVID-19 insurance policy with AON,
a leading insurance company, covering all our workers worldwide. As part of our focus on the communities
in which we operate, we also began production of polycarbonate face shields in Luxembourg, which are
sold to businesses in order to finance the free supply of such face shields to healthcare structures in Italy,
Spain, France and Luxembourg.

To contain the spread, the governments of the various countries introduced increasingly restrictive
measures aimed at limiting movement and contact between people, as well as shutting down—sometimes
entirely—production activities in sectors classed as non-essential, allowing only essential activities and
production to continue, including those of the food, drinks and pharmaceuticals sector in which the group
operates, along with logistics services and transport. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of
our production facilities are operational.

Most of our production facilities continued to operate during the entirety of lockdown measures
imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which we operate in compliance with the
regulations for each country, as the type of activity carried out was classified among those that, except for
temporary bans imposed by local governments, could continue to operate during lockdowns. In particular,
all of our facilities in Europe remained operational in 2020 during the pandemic. Our facilities in Italy,
Spain and France were considered part of the essential supply chain, and remained operational throughout
the respective lockdowns. Our facilities in the United Kingdom and the newly acquired facility in Germany
also continued to operate throughout the lockdown at reduced capacities. The facilities in Eastern Europe
(i.e., Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Belarus) continued to operate at full capacity. Our facilities in Asia
are among those that were most affected by the policies implemented by their respective governments to
contain the spread of the virus. Our facilities in India stopped operations on March 22, 2020 because of the
country’s total lockdown imposed by the local government and resumed operations on April 27, 2020 at
reduced capacity because of the national ban on the sale of alcohol until early May and the shuttering of
bars and restaurants until September, while the Chinese facility stopped during the period between
January 24, 2020 and February 14, 2020. Production at our facilities in the Americas was able to continue
during the entire pandemic, with the exception of Argentina where production was suspended for a limited

84


-----

period of time (March 20, 2020 to April 1, 2020), pending authorization to continue activities necessary for
the essential supply chain. Our facilities in California (U.S.) and Mexico continued to operate as they are
essential to the supply chain, and at sustained rates due to the growth in volumes for brands focused on
off-premises and e-commerce sales, which accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chilean
facility also continued to operate at full capacity and, in Brazil, operations never stopped since the
government authorities have not implemented any lockdown measures. In Colombia, during the lockdown
period from March 20, 2020 to May 11, 2020, production was converted to produce closures for
disinfectants. The production of closures for spirits subsequently resumed, although sales volumes were
depressed by the closure of public places of business by local government order until September, 2020. In
Oceania, our facilities in Australia and New Zealand continued to operate as they are considered part of
essential supply chains. In Africa, our facility in Kenya continued to operate and no local lockdowns were
imposed on manufacturing activities, while the facility in South Africa was partially operational and, during
the lockdown period from March 26, 2020 to April 30, 2020, only produced for the Water & Beverage and
Pharma markets, which the South African government had classified as part of the essential supply chain.
Conversely, production was suspended for the spirits market during that period.

Our business was only marginally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020,
when the impact was limited to operations in India, China, Argentina and South Africa, where operations
were ordered to temporarily shut down, as described above. In the second quarter of 2020, the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic was significant, with a loss of sale volumes mainly in our operations in: (i) India,
where the government imposed a full lockdown of the country between March 22, 2020 and April 27, 2020
and banned the sale of alcohol from the end of March to the start of May with the shuttering of bars and
restaurants until September 2020; (ii) the United Kingdom, where operations are mainly geared more
towards global brands and the duty free market; (iii) South Africa, where the partial closure of the
facilities between March 26, 2020 and April 30, 2020 meant that it was only possible to produce limited
quantities for small niches of the mineral water and beverage markets and the pharmaceutical sector since
the sale of alcohol was banned from March 27 to June 1, 2020 and from July 12 to August 17, 2020; (iv)
Colombia, where production was converted during the March 20 to May 11, 2020 lockdown to produce
closures for disinfectants and public places of business remained shuttered until September 2020; (v) Spain
and Italy, which were the European countries hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second
half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business, but less so than in the second
quarter and the effects remained mostly concentrated in India, Spain, Italy and Colombia.

In terms of our end-markets, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt most heavily in the
spirits market, being the sector with the greatest exposure to consumption in the distribution channel
represented by bars and restaurants, where net revenue decreased by €55.5 million, or 13.8%, from
€402.3 million in 2019 to €346.8 million in 2020 and Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates decreased
by €31.5 million, or 7.8%, from €402.3 million in 2019 to €370.7 million in 2020. Severe social distancing
restrictions resulted in the almost complete closure of the on-premises channel in the second quarter of
2020 and, in certain countries, in the third quarter as well. The strict limits to travel also adversely affected
sales through the duty free channel. Restrictive measures were eased towards the end of the second
quarter of 2020, with local governments gradually lifting shuttering orders on the HORECA industries in
the third quarter of 2020, but certain restrictions continue to remain in place in certain geographies. Near
the end of 2020, as cases rose again in Europe, local authorities ordered new containment measures, which
included another round of restrictions on the HORECA industries and the travel sector.

We were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic both in terms of decreased sales volumes and in terms
of additional costs to ensure the safety of facilities and employees and lower production efficiency as a
result of ensuring compliance with safety and social distancing requirements. These were partly offset by
measures to contain personnel expense, lower travel expenses and government assistance. We incurred
costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which primarily relate to purchasing personal
protective equipment (“PPE”) for employees, sanitization and the adaptation of work areas to comply with
social distancing requirements. In response to the decrease in sales volumes, we began introducing
measures to contain personnel expense in the second quarter of 2020 in order to limit the effect on the
profit margin, which resulted in a decrease in personnel expense, mainly in those European countries hit
the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the United Kingdom, where the furlough schemes
introduced by the government of the United Kingdom allowed us to reduce production on commensurate
basis with the lower sales volumes, and in Spain and in Italy, where production was optimized by
scheduling holiday leave for employees, concentrating production on the weekdays, avoiding production
during the weekend and curtailing bonuses. In India and South Africa, where the extremely severe April

85


-----

lockdowns imposed by the respective governments resulted in a shutdown of approximately one month,
personnel expense did not decrease in proportion to the drop in volumes as we also bore the personnel
expense during the shutdown period, pursuant to local regulations. We were, however, able to reduce
personnel expense in these countries, primarily due to the lower use of temporary workers in India and to
fewer overtime hours worked, the greater use of holiday leave and the decrease in employee numbers in
South Africa. In China, personnel expense fell as a result of the government’s reduction in social security
contributions and the smaller workforce as seven employees resigned during our suspension of between
January 24 and February 14, 2020. In Colombia, which was the country where our operations were
impacted the most in the South American region, we were able to achieve savings on personnel expense
due to the use of holiday leave and the relief granted by the Colombian government which suspended
social security contributions for two months. We also received assistance to decrease personnel expense in
the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Argentina, reductions in social security contributions in China and
liquidity support measures, particularly the postponement of the deadline for payment of indirect taxes
such as VAT in the United Kingdom and the reduction of the VAT rate from 19% to 16% in Germany
from July to December 2020.

Following a more challenging second quarter in 2020, sales on a like-for-like basis and at constant
exchange rates recovered in the third quarter and grew in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the economic
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to ease. As a result, while our net revenue in 2020 decreased by
€34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019, our Net Revenue at Constant
Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to €603.8 million from €606.5 million in
2019.

In the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in
the HORECA industries had a significant negative effect on the European water and beverage sector
(particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany), which heavily relies on on-premises consumption, and we
estimate that this resulted in a reduction in volumes impacting our net revenue by approximately €8 million
in such period. However, this loss was more than offset by increased sales volumes generated outside of
Europe, particularly in the Americas, where revenues grew steadily in the spirits and wine markets, and in
Asia, where revenues grew despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes outside of
Europe also benefitted from customers increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand
on off-premises channels such as supermarkets and e-commerce. As a result, while our net revenue for the
first quarter of 2021 decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, to €138.3 million from €145.9 million for the first
quarter of 2020, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates for the first quarter of 2021 increased by
€1.3 million, or 0.9% to €147.2 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020.

We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our operations. See also “Risks
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact_
_on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, which may be material and” and_
“Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19”.

**_Volume/Mix and Selling Prices_**

Our sales are impacted by changes in the volumes sold based on the different sales mix in product
families and customers from one year to another. Certain of our products generate higher sales prices per
unit volume and increases in sales of those products impact our average sales price volume unit sold. In
particular, we generate the highest sales prices from sales of our specialty closures. In the periods under
review, we have focused on increasing our portion of sales from products that have higher sales prices in
order to support our margins. This policy contributed to the positive volume/mix effect of €12.0 million in
2020 and €7.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. We calculate the volume/mix effect by consolidating period-on-period decreases and increases
in sales volumes and changes in product mix (by product families and customers). In our calculation of the
volume/mix effect, we also include the currency effect generated by the translation of sales invoiced in a
currency other than the local reporting currency, by using the exchange rates of the relevant prior period.

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange rates_**

We operate worldwide and have significant non-euro denominated assets, liabilities, revenue and
costs. The Group is exposed to currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar,
pounds sterling, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish złoty against the euro, our
Group’s reporting currency, as well as against the local reporting currency of each of our subsidiaries. In

86


-----

the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 15%, 13%, 9% and 5% of our net revenue from sales in
U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, Indian rupees and Australian dollars, respectively. We also have exposure to
other currencies such as the Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Argentine peso, South African
rand and New Zealand dollar. Certain of these currencies have experienced considerable volatility against
the euro in recent years which has affected our results of operations.

For example, our reported results of operations were significantly impacted by negative translation
effects of the appreciation of the euro in 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. By way of example to
illustrate and quantify the impact of currency exchange rates on our results of operations that was
significant over the periods under review, if we applied the average exchange rate of the currencies
relevant to our business for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020, our
Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates was €603.8 million (as compared to net revenue of
€572.0 million as reported) and our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates was €104.2 million (as
compared to Adjusted EBITDA €98.0 million as reported), respectively. In addition, our Net Revenue at
Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €147.2 million (as
compared to net revenue of €138.3 million as reported) and our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange
Rates was €26.6 million (as compared to Adjusted EBITDA €24.3 million as reported), respectively.

The foregoing impact on our results of operations is mainly due to the translation effect of non-euro
revenues generated during the periods and the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the British
pound sterling, the Indian rupee, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Argentinian peso and the Mexican peso. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures”.

_Transaction risk_

Our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to purchases of raw materials such as plastic
resin and aluminum which have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollars
and are used to varying degrees in the production of all of our products. Our other fixed costs, such as
energy, personnel and services related to production are typically denominated in the currency of the
relevant production facility (e.g., euro for Italy, złoty for Poland, Brazilian real for Brazil, etc.).
Additionally, our customer contracts are typically payable in the currency of the country where the
contract is signed, even if the customer may sell spirits or wine for a worldwide consumer base. By locating
production in many countries where our customers are based, we seek to match our operating costs with
operating revenue in each of the major currencies in which we operate. To the extent that we have
incurred expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as related revenue, exchange rate
fluctuations have in some cases caused our expenses to increase or decrease as a percentage of total
revenue. We also utilize of derivatives to manage movement in aluminum commodity prices. See “—Costs
_for raw materials”._

_Translation Risk_

Our currency translation risk is primarily related to the recognition of revenue generated by
subsidiaries during our period-end consolidation and reporting. To prepare the consolidated financial
statements of the Group, we translate assets, liabilities, total revenue and expenses into euro at applicable
exchange rates. To determine the applicable exchange rate, we use the average exchange rate for
statement of comprehensive income items for the period in which we are reporting and the spot
period-end exchange rate for balance sheet items. See note 2(d) to the 2020 Financial Statements, as well
as the other financial information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and “—Critical
_accounting policies” below. Both revenue and expenses that are denominated in foreign currency are_
converted into euro at the spot rates of the days on which they are recorded. In order to assist
management to identify trends and compare performance across regions and business units, we report Net
Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates and Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates basis which is
prepared translating the results of a given period in a particular local currency applying the average
exchange rate of the local currency in the same period of the previous year.

**_Costs for raw materials_**

€263.7 million of our costs in 2019, €243.4 million of our costs in 2020 and €61.5 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2021 were related to raw materials. Raw material costs accounted for 43.5% of
our net revenue in 2019, 42.5% of our net revenue in 2020 and 44.4% of our net revenue in the three
months ended March 31, 2021. The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are plastic

87


-----

resins and aluminum. We used a total of 35,481 tons of aluminum in 2020 and consumed more than 43,000
tonnes of different types of plastic (PE, PP, PS, PC, PET, etc.). Plastic resins and aluminum accounted for
€15.9 million and €26.5 million, or approximately 26% and 43%, respectively, of the cost of all raw
materials purchased in the three months ended March 31, 2020; €61.2 million and €110.9 million, or
approximately 25% and 46%, respectively, of the cost of all raw materials purchased in 2020 and
€79.1 million and €110.7 million, or approximately 30% and 42%, respectively, of the cost of all raw
materials purchased in 2019.

Raw materials prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Plastic resins are
subject to substantial price fluctuations resulting from shortages in supply and changes in the prices of
natural gas, crude oil and other petrochemical products from which resins are produced as well as other
factors. Aluminum prices generally exhibit less fluctuation than plastic resins. The price of aluminum has
trended upward in recent years. Aluminum prices on the demand-side are driven by end users from the
construction, transportation (mainly automotive) and consumer (largely packaging) industries.

As we do not typically enter into long-term committed contracts with customers, our contractual
arrangements with customers do not contain pass-through mechanisms that would allow or require us to
make periodic adjustments in prices to account for commodity price fluctuations. As a result of the
foregoing dynamics, generally, any increase in the prices of our raw materials has a direct impact on our
production costs and operating margins unless we are able to raise prices. We believe that the relevant raw
material prices to illustrate price trends are the LME/ton price for aluminum and for plastic resins, the
high density polyethylene (“HDPE”) price and polypropylene and homopolymer price in Europe and the
HDPE price and polystyrene price in India. See “Industry Overview”.

By way of illustration, in the first three months of 2021, the average prices of plastic resins (HDPE
Europe) increased by 10.7% and aluminum prices increased by 12.4%, in each case compared to the first
three months of 2020. In 2020, the average prices of plastic resins (HDPE Europe) decreased by 12.1%
and aluminum prices decreased by 6.5%, in each case compared to 2019, and in 2019, the average prices of
plastic resins increased (HDPE Europe) by 1.7% and the price of aluminum decreased by 9.7% in each
case compared to 2018. These increases and decreases contributed to corresponding changes in our total
costs. We manage this exposure vis-à-vis customers through proactive renegotiation of prices with
customers when raw material prices put pressure on our margins and rely on our long track record of
delivering innovative new products and extracting efficiencies through reduction of raw material use to
maintain, and even modestly raise, prices during low-commodity periods. Sales of closures are based on
contracts and/or purchase orders that mean that at least part of any increase in the prices of raw materials
can be transferred to our customers, when the contracts provide for periodic price adjustments. If this is
not possible, we are able to manufacture similar closures due to our technological expertise using different
materials mix that ensures, nonetheless, product quality. Given our wide product range, we can offer
customers various solutions (using different materials) and to direct their choices to the higher value
added luxury lines, thus better absorbing any raw material price increases without significantly affecting
margins.

We also employ commodity derivatives for aluminum to hedge a certain portion of purchases. On
average, 15% of our aluminum costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 and in the three months ended
March 31, 2021 were related to purchases of aluminum ingots on the London Metal Exchange, through
forward contracts and spot transactions, while the remaining aluminum costs consist primarily of costs
incurred in conversion and processing which are typically contractually fixed for a short period of time. As
we typically purchase aluminum based on contracts that set prices by reference to the aluminum quotations
on the London Metal Exchange in U.S. dollars, which are converted into euro at the average exchange rate
at the month of purchase, we seek to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with aluminum price
fluctuations by entering into forward contracts with brokers operating on the London Metal Exchange,
whereby we purchase aluminum at a fixed price to protect our operating margins from price volatility. We
have not historically hedged the risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of plastics as these raw materials
are not listed on international markets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business is
_subject to fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials” and note 38(b) to the 2020 Financial_
Statements.

Other methods of commodity risk mitigation include the careful selection of our suppliers, in
particular for plastics, where we seek out suppliers that match our pricing, quality and reliability of supply
criteria. We have not experienced any significant difficulties over the past few years in obtaining sufficient
quantities of the raw materials required for our production. We also continually seek to implement
innovative product and process solutions aimed at reducing consumption of raw materials.

**_Demand and activity levels in the spirits and wine end-markets_**

We sell our products primarily to customers operating in the spirits and wine end-markets in various
geographies around the world. In the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended
December 31, 2020, these markets combined represented 84% and 81%, respectively, of our net revenue.
Accordingly, our sales volumes and results of operations depend to a significant extent on the level of
activity and industry trends in these end-markets.

For spirits producers, packaging and brand are key elements in product identification and
differentiation. As a result, demand in this end-market is primarily focused on high quality, customized
and reliable products that enable customers to better differentiate and position their brands against their
competitors. We believe that demand for safety closures in the spirits end-market will continue to grow,
particularly in emerging countries where premium brands are penetrating further and where the risk of
counterfeiting is higher.

Technological solutions, sustainability and zero-environmental impact packaging are also becoming
increasingly important in both the spirits and wine end-markets. Spirits and wine producers as well as their
end-customers are increasingly looking for products with fully integrated technological functionalities that
enhance product safety and customer experience, as well as products with a reduced impact on the
environment, that are recyclable and made with a higher share of recycled materials. We believe that these
will be the key growth and demand trends for our products in the spirits and wine end-markets going
forward.

**_The overall level of, and the interest rates payable on, our indebtedness_**

During the periods under review, we had significant debt service obligations related to the Existing
Notes. As of March 31, 2021, our current and non-current financial liabilities amounted, respectively, to
€24.4 million and €504.4 million, for a total amount of €528.9 million, and, excluding unamortized
transaction costs and the put option liability in respect of non-controlling investors and financial liabilities
related to the Market Warrants, our total financial liabilities amounted to €500.9 million. For information
relating to the interest rates payable on our financial indebtedness, see note 30 to the 2020 Financial
Statement and note 24 to the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. Prior to and following the
Refinancing, we had and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021,
As Adjusted Total Financial Debt would have been €525.7 million (excluding unamortized transaction
costs, the put option liability in respect of non-controlling investors, financial liabilities related to the
Market Warrants and any amounts that we may draw under the Revolving Credit Facility in connection
with the Refinancing). See “Capitalization”.

**_Seasonal factors_**

Our results of operations are affected by seasonal factors for certain product categories (specifically,
roll-on for wine closures and roll-on closures for mineral water), which generally results in an increase in
the sales volumes in the second half of each year and, especially, during holiday periods, which also vary
according to hemisphere. Our sales particularly correspond to variations relating to consumption and/or
production of wine in such regions. Accordingly, our quarterly results of operations will vary from quarter
to quarter due to these seasonal factors, and do not contribute evenly to the annual results.

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, from €145.9 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €138.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Our Net Revenue at

91


-----

Constant Exchange Rates increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9% from €145.9 million for the first quarter of
2020 to €147.2 million. The negative translation impact on net revenue in the first three months of 2021
was €(8.9) million, which was due to the appreciation of the Euro against almost all currencies with which
the Group operates. The change in the consolidation perimeter from the first quarter of 2020 to the first
quarter of 2021 impacted net revenue by €0.1 million, which represents the net effect from the
consolidation of Closurelogic’s assets acquired in February 2020 in Germany and in September 2020 in
Turkey (an increase in net revenue of €2.1 million) and the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020 (a decrease
in net revenue of €2.2 million). The contribution to turnover as a result of this change in the consolidation
scope as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 is not material.

The increase in Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021
was mainly due the positive volumes/mix effect of €7.3 million and the benefit of €1.8 million generated by
our price increase policy. The increase in sales volumes was concentrated in the Americas, where revenues
grew steadily in the spirits and wine markets, and Asia, where revenues grew despite the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. These trends more than offset the impact on our net revenue of approximately
€7.9 million as a result of an estimated reduction in sales volumes in the European water and beverages
sector, which has been negatively affected by the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany, as well as lower volumes in
Oceania.

An analysis of net revenue by product and geographical segment is as follows:

_Safety Closures_

Revenue from safety closures decreased by €1.6 million, or 2.9%, from €54.6 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 to €53.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was

-----

mainly due to a negative translation impact of €(5.1) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange
Rates from safety closures increased by €3.5 million, or 6.4%, to €58.2 million from €54.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volumes in the Americas
and Asia, which more than offset lower sales volumes in Europe.

_Luxury Closures_

Revenue from luxury closures decreased by €0.4 million, or 5.2%, from €7.7 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 to €7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was
mainly due to a negative translation impact of €(0.6) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange
Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from luxury closures increased by €0.2 million, or 2.5%,
to €7.9 million from €7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The slight increase was
mainly due to higher sales volumes in the Mexico, which were almost entirely offset by lower sales volumes
in Europe.

_Roll-on Closures_
Revenue from roll-on closures decreased by €4.6 million, or 9.4%, from €48.8 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 to €44.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, with a negative
translation impact of €(2.1) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months
ended March 31, 2021 from roll-on closures decreased by €2.5 million, or 5.2%, to €46.3 million from
€48.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to lower sales as a
result of the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
which mostly impacted the water & beverages market in Europe, particularly Italy, Spain and Germany.

_Roll-on for Wine Closures_

Revenue from the sale of roll-on for wine closures increased by €1.2 million, or 4.3%, from
€28.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €29.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, despite negative translation impact of €(0.8) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant
Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from wine closures increased by €2.1 million,
or 7.4%, to €30.1 million from €28.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was
mainly due to higher sales volumes in Poland, the Americas and Germany, where we started to operate in
February 2020, which were partly offset by lower sales volumes in Oceania and the United Kingdom.

_Other Revenue_

Other revenue decreased by €2.2 million, or 32.8%, from €6.7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, with a negative translation impact
of €(0.3) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021
from other closures decreased by €1.9 million or 29%, to €4.7 million from €6.7 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020.

_Net revenue by geographical segment_

The following table provides a breakdown of net revenue by main geographical segment (i.e., based
on the geographical location of the subsidiary of the Group that records the revenue rather than the
location of the customer) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021:

_Europe_

Net revenue from operations in Europe decreased by €11.1 million, or 12.2%, from €91.2 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €80.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, with
a negative translation impact of €(2.4) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three
months ended March 31, 2021 of this region decreased by €8.7 million, or 9.6%, to €82.5 million from
€91.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is mainly due to the negative
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first three months of 2021, due to the restrictions implemented
in the HORECA industries, especially in Spain, Italy and Germany. In particular, the total decrease in net
revenue generated in these three countries accounted for €8.8 million in the first three months of 2021.

_Americas_

Net revenue from operations in the Americas increased by €3.5 million, or 14.4%, from €24.3 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €27.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
despite a significant negative translation impact of €(4.9) million, recorded mainly in Mexico, Argentina
and Brazil. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 of this
region increased by €8.4 million, or 34.6%, to €32.7 million from €24.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to the positive net impact on sales volumes from the
COVID-19 pandemic in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was driven primarily by customers
increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises channels such as
supermarkets and e-commerce, particularly in North America, which more than offset the negative impact
on volumes due to the restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic, including in the in
HORECA industries.

_Asia_

Net revenue from operations in Asia increased by €0.5 million, or 2.9%, from €17.2 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a
significant negative translation impact of €(1.6) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the
three months ended March 31, 2021 of this region increased by €2.1 million, or 12.5%, to €19.3 million
from €17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to revenues
growing in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020
when they were already partially impacted by COVID-19. The estimated net impact of the COVID-19
pandemic in Asia was immaterial.

_Oceania_

Net revenue from operations in Oceania decreased by €0.8 million, or 8.8%, from €9.1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a
positive translation impact of €0.5 million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months
ended March 31, 2021 of this region decreased by €1.3 million or 13.8%, to €7.9 million from €9.1 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease in sales volumes
resulting from the slow-down of the domestic wine market, the steady increase in exports of bulk wine and
the recent reduction in wine exports to China. These factors have resulted in a supply surplus in the region,
which led to greater competition and downward pressure on sales prices. In light of these negative trends,

we started the process of reorganizing our business in Australia in order to align its ongoing costs with the
changed market conditions, including by reducing headcount.

_Africa_

Net revenue from operations in Africa increased by €0.3 million, or 7.3%, from €4.1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a
negative translation impact of €(0.4) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three
months ended March 31, 2021 of this region increased by €0.7 million or 17.8%, to €4.8 million from
€4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to the positive net
impact on sales volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to a negative impact in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This positive net impact was
mainly due to customers increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises
channels such as supermarkets and e-commerce, which more than offset the negative impact on volumes
due to the restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic, including in the HORECA industries.

Other operating income increased by €0.1 million, or 9.4%, from €1.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, mainly was due to an
increase in governmental assistance in Bulgaria related to the COVID 19 pandemic and a gain on sales of
non-current assets in Spain, partially offset by a decrease in other income.

**_Internal work capitalized_**

Internal work capitalized increased by €0.4 million, or 45.2%, from €0.8 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Internal work

ended March 31, 2020 to €61.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. As a percentage of net
revenue, these costs decreased from 45.0% in the three months ended March 31, 2020 to 44.4% in the
three months ended March 31, 2021, despite the upward trend in the cost of strategic raw materials, such
as plastic and aluminum. The increase in aluminum costs in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was
mitigated by the positive contribution of hedges.

Personnel expense decreased by €0.7 million, or 1.9%, from €34.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €33.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, mainly due to a decrease in
the cost of direct production personnel, particularly temporary workers, as a result of measures
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of net revenue, personnel expense
increased from 23.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2020 to 24.5% in the three months ended
March 31, 2021.

Other operating expense decreased by €0.4 million, or 15.9%, from €2.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This decrease was
primarily due to lower impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets, use of third-party assets
and other charges compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, which was partly offset by higher
accruals to provisions. The accruals to provisions mainly related to the provisions for company
reorganizations, with the highest balance relating to the Group’s ongoing reorganization in Australia
(€0.3 million) and the accrual to the provision for returns.

**_Amortization and depreciation_**

Amortization and depreciation decreased by €0.6 million, or 3.6%, from €16.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 to €15.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. As a
percentage of net revenue, amortization and depreciation increased from 11.2% in the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to 11.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Net financial expense decreased by €3.5 million, or 33.3%, from €10.6 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This decrease was
primarily the result of to the significant reduction in net exchange losses (€6.5 million), due to the strong
appreciation of the Euro compared to most of the other currencies in which the Group operates in the first
three months of 2021, and the €0.2 million decrease in net interest expense. These factors were partially
offset by a negative effect of €2.4 million due to the increase in the net fair value losses on market
warrants, a €0.8 million reduction in the net fair value gains on non-controlling investors’ put options, and
a €0.1 million decrease in the net fair value gains on currency hedges, which were nil in the three months
ended March 31, 2021, as the Group did not agree any such hedges during the reporting period.

March 31, 2020 to €1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily
due to the €1.1 million decrease in current taxes and the € 0.3 million increase in deferred tax assets.

Despite the increase in our income before taxes in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2020, our current taxes decreased mainly due to the reduction of
taxes that were payable by the Group’s subsidiaries in Eastern Europe and in India, which had lower
profitability in the first three months of 2021. In addition, in countries where we generated higher pre-tax
profits in the three months ended March 31, 2021, including Italy, we benefitted from the carryforward of
previous tax losses.

**_Loss for the period_**

Loss for the period of €6.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 decreased by €5.7 million,
or 91.3%, to a loss of €0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. As a percentage of net

revenue, loss decreased from 4.3% in the first three months of 2020 to 0.4% in the first three months of 2021.
This decrease was mainly due to higher EBITDA (€0.2 million), lower net financial expense (€(3.5) million),
lower amount of amortization and depreciation (€(0.6) million) as well as lower taxes (€(1.5) million).

**_EBIT_**

EBIT increased by €0.8 million, or 10.5%, from €7.1 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020 to €7.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. EBIT margin increased from 4.9% in the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to 5.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Americas, positive volume/mix effects and the increase in
average sales price in Europe, South America and Africa, coupled with the decrease in costs for raw
materials due to the profitable management of strategic raw materials procurement (particularly
aluminum purchases), as well as the achievement of economies of scale in the United Kingdom, Asia and
Latin America as a result of greater efficiency and the reorganization of our production factors. These
factors more than offset the reduction in sales volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the
end-markets that were most affected by the ongoing restrictions on the HORECA industries, particularly
the European water and beverage sector, as well as the higher purchase price of strategic raw materials,
such as aluminum.

Adjusted EBIT increased by €0.8 million, or 10.1%, from €7.8 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to the factors described above.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €0.2 million, or 0.8%, from €24.1 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €24.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a decrease of
€(2.3) million due to the negative translation impact following the appreciation of the Euro against nearly
all currencies with which the Group operates. Our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates
increased by €2.5 million, or 10.4%, in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same
period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Americas and positive
volume/mix effects (€0.8 million), an increase in average sales price in Europe, South America and Africa
(€1.8 million), the profitable management of strategic raw materials procurement (particularly aluminum
purchases), as well as the achievement of economies of scale in the United Kingdom, Asia and Latin
America as a result of greater efficiency and the reorganization of our production factors (€3.0 million).
These factors more than offset the reduction in sales volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the
end-markets that were most affected by the ongoing restrictions on the HORECA industries, particularly
the European water and beverage sector (€(1.1) million), as well as the higher purchase price of strategic
raw materials, such as aluminum (€(1.4) million).

Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was 17.5%, compared to
16.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

The most significant variations affecting the main statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income captions for the periods under review are described below.

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, from €606.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to €572.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates
in 2020 decreased by €2.7 million, or 0.4%, from €606.5 million in 2019 to €603.8 million. The change in the
consolidation perimeter from 2019 to 2020 impacted net revenue by €23.7 million, which represents the net
effect from the consolidation of Closurelogic’s assets in 2020 (an increase in net revenue of €30.9 million), the
sale of the Spanish assets of the PET division in the second half of 2019 (a decrease in net revenue of €1.2
million) and the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020 (a decrease in net revenue of €6.0 million). Excluding this
net effect, This decrease was primarily due to the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Following a
more challenging second quarter, sales on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates recovered in the
third quarter and grew in the fourth quarter.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a positive volumes/mix effect of €12.0 million and
price increases generated a benefit of €4.9 million. However, these positive effects were fully offset by the
estimated impact of a loss of volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An analysis of net revenue by product and geographical segment is as follows:

_Safety Closures_

Revenue from safety closures decreased by €52.4 million, or 20.4%, from €256.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €203.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative translation impact
of €(16.1) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates from safety closures in 2020 decreased by
€36.3 million, or 14.2%, to €219.8 million from €256.1 million in 2019, mainly as a consequence of the lower
sales following the outbreak of COVID-19, primarily due to its impact on the spirits market.

_Luxury Closures_

Revenue from luxury closures decreased by €3.1 million, or 9.5%, from €32.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative
translation impact of €(2.2) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates from luxury closures in
2020 decreased by only €0.8 million, or 2.6%, to €32.0 million from €32.8 million in 2019. The decrease in
revenue from luxury closures was mainly due to lower sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Roll-on Closures_

Revenue from roll-on closures increased by €21.7 million, or 12.1%, from €179.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative
translation impact of €(6.5) million. This increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets
in 2020, which increased revenue from roll-on closures by €26.3 million.

_Roll-on for Wine Closures_

Revenue from the sale of roll-on for wine closures increased by €7.6 million, or 7.0%, from
€108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €115.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, despite the negative translation impact of €(5.7) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange
Rates from roll-on for wine closures in 2020 increased by €13.3 million, or 12.3%, to €121.6 million from
€108.3 million in 2019, mainly as a consequence of the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in 2020, which
increased net revenue from roll-on for wine closures by €4.3 million, and the growth in sales in the United
Kingdom, Chile and North America.

_Other Revenue_
Other revenue decreased by €8.4 million, or 28.0%, from €30.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The reduction is mainly due to
the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020 and the sale of part of the PET business in 2019.

_Europe_

Net revenue from operations in Europe decreased by €12.9 million, or 3.6%, from €358.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €345.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a
negative translation impact of €(6.1) million. The decrease is mainly due to the sale of some of the Spanish
assets of the PET division to third parties and the sale of GCL Pharma S.r.l. in the second quarter of 2020
and a decrease in sales as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to
operations in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, which had a negative impact on our net revenue in
Europe. The decrease was only partially offset by the positive contribution of €30.9 million in revenue from
the acquisition of Closurelogic.

_Americas_

Net revenue from operations in the Americas increased by €2.7 million, or 2.5%, from €109.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €112.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, despite the
negative translation impact of €(18.4) million recorded, mainly in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Net
Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020 increased by €21.1 million, or 19.2%, to
€130.8 million from €109.8 million in 2019. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in this region led to
significant growth in sales in the North American spirits market following the increase in off-premises
demand and penetration in new businesses/customers, which had a positive impact, in Mexico due to
greater sales in the U.S. market, which had a positive impact of €0.7 million, and the increase in sales in
the Chilean wine market.

_Asia_

Net revenue from operations in Asia decreased by €20.7 million, or 25.8%, from €80.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue at
Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020 decreased by €16.7 million, or 20.8%, to €63.5 million from
€80.1 million in 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the drop in sales after the shutdown of facilities in
India and China during the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and operations that were at
less than full capacity in the subsequent months because of the contraction in domestic consumption
following the ban on the sale of alcohol between the end of March and the start of May and the shuttering
of bars and restaurants until September in India, causing an overall negative impact on sale volume in Asia
compared to 2019 of €17.2 million. In addition, the decrease was partially due to the transfer of some of
the volumes previously produced by our Indian subsidiary to the business start-up in Kenya.

_Oceania_

Net revenue from operations in Oceania decreased by €1.9 million, or 4.7%, from €40.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the
negative translation impact of €(1.1) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in
2020 decreased by €0.8 million, or 1.9%, to €39.3 million from €40.1 million in 2019. Sales in this region are
mainly tied to the wine segment which has in recent years has been impacted by exports of unbottled wine
that is then bottled in the country of destination. The delay in the bottling season due to the COVID-19
pandemic has partly eroded sales volumes in 2020.

_Africa_

Net revenue from operations in Africa decreased by €1.7 million, or 9.3%, from €18.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative
translation impact of €(2.2) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020
increased by €0.5 million, or 2.6%, to €18.8 million from €18.3 million in 2019. The decrease in revenue
was also due to operations in South Africa and, in particular, the partial suspension of production from
March 26 to April 30 following the lockdown imposed by the local authorities and the ban on the sale of
alcohol between March 27 and June 1 and between July 12 and August 17. Specifically, production of
closures for the spirits market in South Africa was suspended by the South African government and
production was only allowed for the water & beverage and pharma markets that were designated as
essential, causing an overall negative impact of €(2.5) million. Despite the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, operations in Kenya continue to grow at sustained rates, partly offsetting the downturn in South
Africa.

Other operating income increased by €0.6 million, or 13.1%, from €4.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €5.6 million for the year December 31, 2020, mainly due to higher government
grants received in 2020.

December 31, 2019 to €243.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, despite the effect of the

104


-----

change in the scope of consolidation which, in 2020, also included the operations of Guala Closures
Deutschland and Turkey, which increased costs for raw materials by €18.0 million, partly offset by a
decrease in costs of €2.8 million due to the deconsolidation of GCL Pharma following its sale and the sale
of the Spanish assets of the PET division to third parties.

As a percentage of net revenue, these costs decreased from 43.5% in 2019 to 42.5% in 2020, mainly
due to lower raw materials prices, particularly for aluminum and plastic.

Costs for services decreased by €4.1 million, or 3.7%, from €109.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €105.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the sharp
decrease in travel expenses due to travel restrictions and remote working as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the decrease in energy costs due to the lower volumes. The decrease was partially offset by
the change in the additional costs of Guala Closures Deutschland and Guala Closures Turkey, which were
consolidated in 2020.

Personnel expense increased by €4.6 million, or 3.6%, from €125.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €129.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly as a result of the net
impact from the change in the scope of consolidation from 2019 to 2020. Net personnel expense related to
the acquisition of Closurelogic net of the disposal of GCL Pharma increased personnel expense by
€7.2 million. Excluding this impact, personnel expense primarily due to the cost containment policies that
we implemented in the second and third quarters of 2020 to mitigate the impact of the lower sale volumes
on profitability following the global outbreak of COVID-19.

This resulted in a decrease in personnel expense, mainly in those European countries that experienced
more severe effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the United Kingdom, where the furlough
schemes introduced by the government of the United Kingdom allowed us to reduce production on
commensurate basis with the lower sales volumes, and in Spain and Italy, where production was optimized
by scheduling holiday leave for employees, concentrating production on the weekdays, avoiding production
during the weekend and curtailing bonuses.

In India and South Africa, where the extremely severe April lockdowns imposed by the respective
governments resulted in a shutdown of approximately one month, personnel expense did not decrease in
proportion to the drop in volumes as we also bore the personnel expense during the shutdown period,
pursuant to local regulations. We were, however, able to reduce personnel expense in these countries,
primarily due to the lower use of temporary workers in India and to fewer overtime hours worked, the
greater use of holiday leave and a decrease in in the number of employees in South Africa.

Other operating expense decreased by €2.0 million, or 18.5%, from €10.9 million for the year ended
December 21, 2019 to €8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to smaller accruals
to loss allowances, which primarily relate to accruals for company reorganization and returns. The
reduction mainly related to smaller accruals for company reorganization in 2020 following the accruals in
2019 for the reorganizations of the PET division, which impacted Guala Closures Spain of €1.6 million,
Guala Closures France of €0.9 million and Guala Closures UCP of €0.1 million. In 2020, accruals for
company reorganization mainly consisted of that by Guala Closures UCP, which in June began a
reorganization process entailing around 30 redundancies and a cost of €0.6 million, and the accrual of
€0.3 million for Closurelogic’s planned reorganization.

**_Impairment losses_**

Impairment losses increased by €2.8 million, or 463.9%, from €0.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Impairment losses in 2019

included €0.4 million related to the plant and machinery of Guala Closures France’s Saint Rémy facility
that was closed following the company reorganization and €0.2 million of leasehold improvements and
plants of Beijing Guala Closures in connection with the notice of potential early termination of the lease
for the building in which the Chinese subsidiaries operates. Impairment losses in 2020 included
€3.4 million to adjust the carrying amount of the Group’s proprietary patents to their value in use (i.e., the
present value of proprietary patents which arise from the forecasted future value included in the long-term
plans approved by the Group) following the adjustment of the sales estimates of the products covered by
these patents.

**_Amortization and depreciation_**

Amortization and depreciation increased by €1.8 million, or 2.9%, from €62.9 million in 2019 to
€64.7 million in 2020.

Net financial expense increased by €6.7 million, or 23.7%, from €28.4 million in 2019 to €35.1 million
in 2020. This increase is mainly due to the increase in net exchange losses in the amount of €4.5 million
following the significant appreciation of the euro against many of the currencies of the countries in which
we operate and the negative impact of fair value losses on market warrants of €2.6 million. These negative
effects in 2020 were partly offset by the following positive factors: (i) a €0.9 million decrease in net interest
expense compared to 2019; (ii) the positive impact of €0.8 million due to the fair value gains on currency
derivatives; and (iii) the positive impact of €0.2 million due to the fair value gains on liabilities to
non-controlling investors.

Income taxes decreased by €0.6 million, or 30.3%, from €2.1 million in 2019 to €1.5 million in 2020,
primarily due to lower current taxes, partly offset by the reduced reversal of deferred taxes. Current taxes
in 2020 decreased by €3.2 million as compared 2019 mainly due to our lower results because of the
COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in relation to our business in India. The reduction in current taxes in the
countries that experienced more severe effects from the COVID-19 pandemic was partly offset by an
increase in the current taxes payables by the Group where actual results increased in the year ended
December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, such as, for example, our operations
in Ukraine and United States.

The decrease in deferred taxes is primarily due to the smaller reversal of deferred taxes on the gains
recognized in connection with the purchase price accounting and, in particular, the one-time recognition in
2019 of the €4.0 million reversal of deferred taxes recognized on the gains that arose in connection with the
purchase price accounting for our operations in India following the reduction in the tax rate applicable in
India from 35% to 25%.

**_Profit (loss) for the year_**

Profit for the year of €14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €20.6 million,
or 140.4%, to a loss of €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of net revenue,
profit decreased from 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a loss of 1.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the following effects: the contraction in the EBITDA
(loss) by €12.7 million, the increase in net financial expense by €6.7 million, including €4.5 million for
greater exchange losses as the euro appreciated against the other currencies in the regions in which we
operate) and the increase in amortization and depreciation of with a negative impact of €1.8 million, partly
offset by lower taxes with a positive impact of €0.6 million.

**_EBIT_**

EBIT decreased by €14.5 million, or 32.0%, from €45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
to €30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. EBIT margin decreased from 7.5% of net revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 5.4% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. This
decrease was mainly due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in additional
costs and lower production efficiency to ensure the safety of facilities and employees and comply with
safety and social distancing requirements, which was only partly offset by measures to contain personnel
expenses, lower travel expenses and government assistance.

December 31, 2019 to €33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €15.6 million, or 13.7%, from €113.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the negative
translation impact of €(6.2) million following the appreciation of the euro against almost all other
currencies that we use in conducting our operations.

Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates decreased by €9.3 million, or 8.2%, in the year ended
December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to the negative impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales volumes decreased and we
incurred additional costs to ensure the safety of employees and the safe operation of our facilities,
including lower production efficiency to ensure compliance with safety and social distancing requirements.
This impact was partly offset by measures to contain personnel expenses, lower travel expenses and
government assistance in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 17.1%, compared to 18.7% for
the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the dilution effect caused by the consolidation of Closurelogic’s
assets that we acquired in 2020.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, our historical liquidity requirements have arisen
primarily from the need to meet our debt service requirements, to finance our operations and to fund
capital expenditures, product research and development and acquisitions. We expect that these will
continue to be our primary liquidity requirements.

In connection with the Offers, the results of which were announced by SPSI on June 7, 2021, the
change of control provision in our Existing Notes were triggered and the Issuer will be required in
accordance with the provisions of the indenture governing the Existing Notes to make an offer to holders
of the Existing Notes to repurchase any or all of their Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount of such Existing Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, unless the Issuer elects to redeem all of the outstanding Existing Notes at par prior to the
date on which the Issuer is required to make such an offer. There is committed financing in place in order
to fund the redemption, if required. We will apply the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to redeem
the Existing Notes and pay accrued interest thereon, to repay amounts outstanding under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, for general corporate
purposes and to pay fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds”. Our

109

primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings from financial institutions
under our credit facilities, particularly the €80.0 million Revolving Credit Facility that will be entered into
in connection with the Transactions.

As of March 31, 2021, our current and non-current financial liabilities amounted, respectively, to
€24.4 million and €504.4 million, for a total amount of €528.9 million, and, excluding unamortized
transaction costs and the put option liability in respect of non-controlling investors and financial liabilities
related to the Market Warrants, our total financial liabilities amounted to €500.9 million. As of March 31,
2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing our As Adjusted Total Financial Debt would have been
€525.7 million (excluding unamortized transaction costs, the put option liability in respect of
non-controlling investors, financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants and any amounts that we may
draw under the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the Refinancing).

From time to time we engage in the sale of our trade receivables on the basis of without-recourse
factoring arrangements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. The COVID-19
pandemic partly contributed to the decrease in trade receivables from €104.1 million as of December 31,
2019 to €92.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and €97.2 million as of March 31, 2021, which, in turn,
resulted in a reduction in the use of without-recourse factoring from €28.2 million as of December 31, 2019
to €26.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and €20.8 million as of March 31, 2021.

Our current and prospective liquidity is monitored constantly. We have not experienced any
significant changes in terms of collection or payment activities directly or indirectly related to the
COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that the available liquidity is adequate to cover current and prospective
operating needs and debt service obligations.

However, we face significant risks to our liquidity. For instance, our business may not generate
sufficient cash flows from operations or future debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including under the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to our Indebtedness—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt obligations”._

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity also include:

   - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a decline in EBIT from our operations, which could be
caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole;

   - the failure of our customers to make payments due to us;

   - a delay by our customers to make payments due to us;

  - any further significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses related
thereto; and

   - the need to fund maintenance capital expenditures.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduced or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; and/or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not accomplish any of the foregoing alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if
at all. In addition, the terms of the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and any future debt may limit our
ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

purchase price accounting procedure related to the acquisition of Closurelogic business by Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH
in February 2020.

_Cash Flows from (used in) Operating Activities_

Net cash flows from (used in) operating activities changed by €11.5 million from an outflow of €1.9 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to an inflow of €9.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) the €4.3 million increase in profit before taxation compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2020, (ii) the €11.1 million reduction in negative changes in trade
receivables, payables and inventory compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 and (iii) the €0.7
million decrease in taxes compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. These positive effects were
partly offset by the €3.6 million decrease in net financial expenses and the €0.3 million increase in gains on
the sale of non-current assets and the €0.2 million decrease in other operating items.

Net cash flows from operating activities decreased €9.5 million from €86.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the decrease
of: (i) €21.2 million of higher loss before taxation partially offset by higher net financial expenses of
€6.7 million and higher depreciation and amortization of €1.8 million; and (ii) €5.9 million in changes in
trade receivables, payables and inventory. These decreases were partly offset by the €3.2 million
improvement in cash flows for taxes, mainly due to the deferral of payment of indirect taxes such as VAT
in the United Kingdom as part of liquidity support measures introduced by the government of the United
Kingdom in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Cash Flows used in Investing Activities_

Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by €11.9 million from €22.6 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 to €10.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due
to lower outflows for M&A activities in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which consisted of
€1.6 million for the acquisition of an additional 10% in the share capital of the Group’s UK associate
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., compared to €12.2 million for the acquisition of Closurelogic’s business in
Germany and €0.9 million for the subscription of the first minority stake of 20% in the share capital of
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. in the three months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, cash flows used for Net
Capital Expenditure decreased by €0.5 million from €9.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020
to €9.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €1.9 million from €36.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to M&A
activities which generated net negative outflows of €6.2 million in 2020, including €12.4 million for the
acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in Germany and Turkey and €0.9 million to acquire the non-controlling
interest in the UK company SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., which was partly offset by the €7.1 million
generated by the sale of the equity investment in GCL Pharma as compared to outflows for M&A of only
€0.6 million in 2019 for the deferred payment of the Indian company Axiom Propack. In addition, cash
flows used for Net Capital Expenditure decreased by €3.7 million from €35.4 million in 2019 to
€31.8 million in 2020.

_Cash Flows generated (used in) Financing Activities_

Net cash flows generated (used) in financing activities changed by €25.2 million from an inflow of
€16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to an outflow of €9.1 million for the three months

111


-----

ended March 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to higher proceeds from new borrowings to support
the working capital increase and investing activities completed in the first three months of 2020.

Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by €14.3 million, from €43.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to
the higher proceeds from new borrowings related to the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in Germany
and Turkey and higher repayment of leases.

_Dividends_

Pursuant to Article 20.2 of the Issuer’s by-laws, the net profit resulting from the financial results will
be distributed among the Issuer’s shareholders, after deduction of the 5% to be allocated to the legal
reserve, until this reserve will have reached 1/5 of the share capital, pursuant to what is resolved by the
Board of Directors. Moreover, pursuant to Article 20.3 of the Issuer’s by-laws, the Board of Directors of
the Issuer may, during the course of a financial year, distribute interim dividends pursuant to the law in
force from time to time. In 2020, we made a distribution of dividends to non-controlling investors in the
amount of €6.9 million.

The ability of the Issuer to distribute dividends to its shareholders will be subject to any contractual
restrictions, including the restricted payments covenants in the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Contractual Obligations_**

The table below summarizes our actual material contractual obligations and commitments as of
March 31, 2021, net of capitalized transaction costs and excluding the financial liabilities related to the
Market Warrants as described under “Principal Shareholders” and financial liabilities to non-controlling
investors of €28.7 million in respect of certain put options.

**_Minority investor put options_**

We conduct our business activities in Ukraine through our subsidiary, Guala Closures Technologia
Ukraine LLC, in Bulgaria through our subsidiary, Guala Closures Bulgaria AB, in Poland through our
subsidiary, “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A. and in Belarus through our subsidiary, Guala Closures BY
LLC, and 30% of the share capital of each such entity is owned by a minority investor that is also a
manager (or General Manager in respect of “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A.) of such company. Guala
Closures International B.V. entered into shareholders’ agreements with each such minority shareholder. In
our consolidated financial statements, the potential right of the minority shareholder to exercise its put
option right if certain conditions are met is recognized as a liability based on the discounted estimated
value of the put option at its estimated time of exercise. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of such liability
was €28.7 million. See note 24 to our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Indebtedness—As of March 31, 2021, we have recorded a financial liability in the amount of_
_€28.7 million in respect of a put option relating to 30% of the share capital of our Ukrainian, Polish, Bulgarian_
_and Belarusian subsidiaries”._

**Contingent Liabilities and Commitments**

We are involved, from time to time, in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, arising in the
ordinary course of business. Except for potential liabilities for which we have accrued sufficient provisions,
as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are no such matters pending that our management
expects to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on a
view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. We consult legal counsel on matters related to
litigation. We also consult with experts both within and outside our company with respect to other matters
that arise in the ordinary course of business. Examples of such matters that are based on assumptions,
judgments and estimates are the amount to be paid to settle certain other liabilities. A liability is accrued if
the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable, or if both its occurrence and the amount it will cost are
estimable.

**Net Capital Expenditure**

Our capital expenditure and investments relate primarily to extending, upgrading and maintaining our
production facilities, research and development activities and investments in new technologies as well as
expenditures to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) law and regulations and
sustainability. We define Net Capital Expenditure as Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets less Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in our
Statement of cash flows. On average, our Net Capital Expenditure represents between 5.5% and 6.5% of
our net revenue.

For purposes of this presentation, we also present Growth Capital Expenditure (which includes
investments in NFC technologies), Maintenance Capital Expenditure and EHS and Sustainability Capital
Expenditure. Growth Capital Expenditure includes discretionary investments to expand our geographical
footprint or increase our manufacturing capacity and capabilities and cost savings and efficiency projects to
optimize our operations, equipment and footprint. Growth Capital Expenditure also includes certain
discretionary investments in the design, development and production of solutions with embedded NFC
technologies. Maintenance Capital Expenditure includes critical ordinary course investments in tangible
and fixed assets to ensure the continuing operation of our asset base. EHS and Sustainability Capital
Expenditure includes expenditures related to applicable EHS laws and regulations and sustainability.

(i) The comparative figures for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were restated to reflect the effects of the completion of the
purchase price accounting procedure related to the acquisition of Closurelogic business by Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH
in February 2020.

Net Capital Expenditure in the three months ended March 31, 2021, totalling €9.0 million, mainly
related to investments made to increase production capacity, develop new products, perform plant
maintenance and make EHS investments. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group
directed most capital expenditure specifically towards Europe (the facilities in Poland, Italy, Germany,
Ukraine and Bulgaria), Asia (particularly India) and in Africa (especially in Kenya). Net Capital Expenditure
in Italy was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, new product development and extraordinary
plant maintenance. Net Capital Expenditure in Poland was mainly aimed at increasing production capacity.
Net Capital Expenditure in Ukraine was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, plant safety and
extraordinary plant maintenance. Furthermore, in Europe, Net Capital Expenditure comprised investments
in new product development at our facilities in Bulgaria and our research center in Luxembourg, as well as
significant maintenance expenditure for our plants in the United Kingdom and Ukraine. Net Capital
Expenditure in Africa mainly related to extraordinary maintenance of our plants in South Africa and the
increase in production capacity of our plant in Kenya. Net Capital Expenditure in Oceania mainly focused on
Australia, where we invested in production efficiencies.

Net Capital Expenditure in 2020, totaling €31.8 million, mainly related to work on plant and
machinery to develop new products and expand production capacity and efficiency, in addition to
considerable investments in EHS and sustainability. During the year, the Group directed most capital
expenditure specifically towards Europe (the facilities in Italy, Poland and Ukraine), Asia (particularly
India) and South America (especially Mexico). Net Capital Expenditure in Italy was mainly directed at
increasing production capacity, new product development and extraordinary plant maintenance. Net
Capital Expenditure in Poland, was mainly aimed at increasing production capacity. Net Capital
Expenditure in Ukraine, was primarily aimed at increasing production capacity, plant safety and
extraordinary plant maintenance. Furthermore, in Europe, Net Capital Expenditure comprised
investments in new product development at the facilities in France and Bulgaria and the research center in
Luxembourg as well as for extraordinary maintenance on plants in the United Kingdom, Spain and
Germany. Net Capital Expenditure in Asia was targeted, in particular, at our Indian facilities where we
invested in extraordinary plant maintenance and new product development. Net Capital Expenditure in
the Americas was mainly focused on our Mexican facility, with projects for plant safety and extraordinary
maintenance. We also made smaller investments at all the other facilities across the region. In Africa, Net
Capital Expenditure related mainly to extraordinary maintenance on plants in South Africa and the
increase in production capacity at the facility in Kenya. In Australia and New Zealand, Net Capital
Expenditure mainly consisted of small maintenance expenditures.

Net Capital Expenditure in 2019 amounted to €35.4 million, mainly related to plant and machinery
and covered, although to differing extents, all five continents where the group operates. In particular,
capital expenditure was concentrated in Europe and mostly related to the facilities in Italy, Ukraine and
the United Kingdom. Net Capital Expenditure in Italy mainly related to the development of new products

and the increase in production capacity, with a particular focus on the mineral water market and the
extraordinary maintenance of facilities. Net Capital Expenditure in Ukraine mainly related to the
development of new products, the increase in production capacity and the safety of the production
facilities. Considerable Net Capital Expenditure in extraordinary maintenance and safety was made at the
facilities of Guala Closures UCP, acquired in December 2018. Net Capital Expenditure at the Polish
facility in 2019 related to the construction of the new warehouse and the development of production
capacity and the extraordinary maintenance of the plant and machinery used. At the French facility, Net
Capital Expenditure focussed on the reorganization of production with a new layout and new machinery.
Finally, in Europe, Net Capital Expenditure went to new product development and increasing the
production capacity of the our facilities in Spain and Bulgaria. We also continued to make capital
expenditures at the Luxembourg research department for the development of new products and in
streamlining and increasing production capacity. In Asia, substantial Net Capital Expenditure was
undertaken at our facilities in India, particularly in relation to the expansion of the Dharwad production
facility during 2019. In the Americas, Net Capital Expenditure mainly focused on the our facility in Mexico
with projects to cut production costs and increase production capacity and smaller capital expenditure was
also made in all the other facilities in the area. In Africa, most Net Capital Expenditure was directed at
Guala Closures East Africa’s Kenyan facility, where production began in February 2019. In Australia and
New Zealand only small investments of immaterial amounts were made for maintenance.

We expect that our Net Capital Expenditure as a percentage of our net revenue for the year ending
December 31, 2021 will be broadly in line with our Net Capital Expenditure for 2020.

**Net Working Capital**

The following table sets forth a breakdown of Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2019 and
2020, and as of March 31, 2020 and 2021:

December 31, 2020, which is in line with normal seasonal trends.

Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2020 amounted to €123.8 million, down €4.1 million on
December 31, 2019, despite the increase due to the change in scope.

_Q1 2021 vs 2020_

Compared to December 31, 2020, Net Working Capital days increased by 15 days as of March 31,
2021, which is in line with normal seasonal trends of the Group’s business. There were no significant

payment delays or deferrals on the part of customers because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade
receivables reflected the positive impact of the various group companies’ use of factoring without-recourse,
also related to the purchasing policies of our main customers. The impact of factoring without-recourse as
of March 31, 2021 amounted to €20.8 million, compared to €26.7 million as of December 31, 2020. The
decrease was due to an overall reduction in turnover with customers whose receivables are usually
factored.

_2020 vs 2019_

Compared to December 31, 2019, Net Working Capital days decreased by one at the end of 2020 due
to the special focus and steps taken by management. There were no significant payment delays or deferrals
on the part of customers because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade receivables reflect the positive
impact of the various group companies’ use of without-recourse factoring, also related to the purchasing
policies of our main customers. The impact of without-recourse factoring at December 31, 2020 amounts
to €26.7 million, compared to €28.2 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to an overall
reduction in turnover with customers whose receivables are usually factored.

The below chart summarizes Net Working Capital days for the periods indicated, calculated on the
last quarter sales figures.

**Off-Balance Sheet Commitments**

As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Financial
Statements. These policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by management using
information available at the time the estimations are made. The application of these estimates and
assumptions affects the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates given the uncertainty surrounding the
assumptions and conditions upon which the estimates are based.

A more detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by us in preparing our
consolidated financial statements is included in note 2 to our 2020 Financial Statements and our
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Accounting for business combinations_**

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of
activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In
determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the
set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether
the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.

The Group has an option to apply a “concentration test” that permits a simplified assessment of
whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or
group of similar identifiable assets. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured
at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs
are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in the profit or loss statement.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to
pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then
it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent
consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of
the contingent consideration are recognized in the profit or loss statement.

If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by
the acquirer’s employees (acquirer’s awards), then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s
replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement awards compared with the
market-based measure of the acquirer’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to
pre-combination service.

117


-----

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

As of each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets, except
for inventories and deferred tax assets, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any
such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash
generating units (“CGUs”). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups
of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount.

Impairment losses are recognized in the profit or loss statements. They are allocated first to reduce
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the
other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. With respect to other assets, an impairment
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been
recognized.

**_Income taxes_**

Income taxes comprise current and deferred tax. They are recognized in profit or loss except to the
extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other
comprehensive income.

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year
and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates
enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from
dividends as well as any tax arising from dividends and any interest and penalties imposed by the tax
authorities following their review of the tax position of previous years which found a difference in tax due.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is not recognized for:

temporary differences in the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, to the
extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future;

taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related
tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to
temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in
which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and
liabilities. The income tax related to dividends are recognized when the dividend is approved.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of
uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its

118


-----

accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors,
including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and
assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become
available that causes the Group to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities;
such changes to tax liabilities will affect tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.

**_Provision_**

Provisions include certain or probable costs and charges, the amount or due date of which is unknown at
the end of the financial year. A provision is recognized when (i) a company has a present obligation (legal
or constructive) as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow from the company of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and (ii) a reliable estimate can be
made of the obligation. The provisions are stated as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle
the obligation at the reporting date or to transfer it to a third party at that date. If the impact of
discounting the time value of money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected
future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value
of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as interest expense.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

During the periods under review, we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be principally
exposed to market risk from changes in the prices of raw materials, foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. We monitor and manage those risks as an integral part of our overall risk management
which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce their potentially adverse
effects on our results.

**_Currency Risk_**

This risk relates to the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on sales and purchases in currencies
other than the functional currencies of the various Group entities. The Group is exposed to currency risk,
particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, Indian rupee,
Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish zloty.

Interest on loans is denominated in the currency of the cash flows generated by the group’s underlying
transactions. The risk of exchange fluctuations is managed by using currency hedges from time to time
when significant differences between cost and revenue in foreign currency were noticed and such
differences were hedged through currency swaps. These provided for the purchase/sale of agreed amounts
in foreign currency at a set exchange rate against the euro.

The impact of exchange rates fluctuations on our results of operations is significant. For more
information, see “—Principal factors affecting our results of operations—Fluctuations in currency exchange
_rates” and note 38 of our 2020 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**_Credit Risk_**

This is the risk that a customer or the counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to meet an
obligation, leading to a financial loss. These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables and financial
investments.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk depends largely on each customer’s specific characteristics. The
demographics of the Group’s customer portfolio, including the segment insolvency risk and the country
risk, have an impact on the credit risk. See note 38 of our 2020 Financial Statements for further
information.

The Group accrues a loss allowance equal to the estimated losses on trade and other loans and
receivables. This allowance comprises both the recognition of impairment losses for material individual
amounts and the recognition of collective impairment for similar groups of assets to cover losses already
incurred but not yet identified. The collective impairment losses are calculated on the basis of historical
payment statistics.

Most of the Group’s trade receivables are due from leading operators of the alcoholic and
non-alcoholic beverage segment. Most of its trading relationships are with long-standing customers. The
Group reduces its credit risk using supplier financing lines made available by its main customers and
factoring without recourse part of its trade receivables.

119


-----

The Group’s historical figures indicate a modest amount of credit losses. The risk is fully covered by
the corresponding loss allowance recognized in the Financial Statements.

There are no cases of particularly concentrated credit risk in geographical terms.

**_Liquidity risk_**

This risk relates to the Group’s ability to meet its obligations arising from financial liabilities. The
Group’s approach to liquidity management is to ensure adequate funds are always available to meet its
obligations at the expiry dates, both in normal conditions and at times of financial difficulty, without
incurring borrowing expense at terms higher than market conditions.

The Group generally ensures there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents to cover forecast short-term
operating expenses, including those related to financial liabilities. Contingent effects arising from extreme
situations that cannot reasonably be forecast, such as natural disasters, are excluded from the above.

The aim of the Group’s financing strategy is to maintain a well-balanced maturity profile for liabilities
to thereby reduce the refinancing risk.

Historically, the Group has always met its obligations on time and has been able to re-finance
indebtedness before its expiry.

See note 30, 31 and 38 of our 2020 Financial Statements for further information.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk relates to volatility of the market rates that determine the interest expense paid on
outstanding loans. The Group is currently exposed to interest rate risk as almost all of its financial
liabilities is subject to the payment of interest at floating rates subject to short-term repricing, including
borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and indebtedness under the Existing Notes. Any
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will also be subject to such interest rate risk. The Group
does not currently deem it necessary to hedge the portion of the liability subject to interest rate risk given
the current EURIBOR parameters.

As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that a hypothetical increase of 100 basis point in the interest
rate on our floating rate borrowings could have the net effect of increasing our cash outflows for the year
ended December 31, 2020 by €7.1 million.

See note 38 of our 2020 Financial Statements for further information.

**_Raw material price risk_**

As a result of the nature of its activities, the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the
purchase price of raw materials, particularly plastics and aluminum.

The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of plastics has not been hedged, as these raw materials
were not listed on international markets (the London Metal Exchange). However, the risk of fluctuations
in the purchase price of aluminum is partly hedged based on market needs and outlook through derivatives
that set the forward purchase price as described under “—Principal factors affecting our results of
_operations—Costs for raw materials”._

See note 38 of our 2020 Financial Statements for further information.

**_Capital Management_**

The Group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the
Group’s future and support its future development. Therefore, the Group seeks to maintain a sufficient
level of capitalization, while providing shareholders with satisfactory returns and ensuring access to
external sources of financing at acceptable terms, including by maintaining an adequate rating. The Group
monitors its debt to equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net indebtedness and cash
flows generated by operating activities. The Board of Directors carefully monitors the balance between
greater returns through the right level of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position. To
achieve these objectives, the Group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable. The Board
of Directors monitors the return on capital, being total equity attributable to owners of the Group’s parent
and the amount of dividends to be distributed to holders of ordinary shares. There were no changes in the
Group’s approach to capital management during the period under review.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**Principal markets**

Guala is a world leader in the production and sale of aluminium and plastic closures for the beverage
industry. Guala primarily manufactures closures for global premium and local brands in the global spirits
and Roll-on for wine markets. It also manufactures closures for water and other beverages as well as for
vegetable oils and other condiments.

Packaging (bottle, label and closure) is an important consideration for spirits and Roll-on for wine
producers worldwide and is increasingly becoming a significant point of differentiation as spirits and
Roll-on for wine producers compete to attract consumers. The proliferation of spirits and Roll-on for
wines available to the consumer at the retail level has made packaging increasingly important in conveying
quality and brand image. Further, consolidation within the spirits and Roll-on for wine industry and the
formation of several major international spirits and Roll-on for wine conglomerates with substantial
advertising and marketing budgets has led to an increased emphasis on branding, especially as
international spirits and Roll-on for wine producers increasingly pursue a strategy of “premiumization”
and protection of their brands. Increasingly, local or regional producers in the emerging markets are also
focusing on their packaging content in order to build new points of differentiation between their brands
and competing brands. As such, spirits and Roll-on for wine producers, both in respect of global brands
and local brands, work closely with packaging suppliers, including closures manufacturers, in order to
design the desired image for their product and to help differentiate each product from its competitors.

Closures have today become part of the brand image for renowned global spirits and Roll-on for
wines, allowing an end consumer to identify his or her favourite brand and to build a relationship with the
brand. The look and feel of a product’s closure has a significant bearing on the consumer’s perception of
quality and consistency of the brand, which is especially important for premium brands. Further, as spirits
and Roll-on for wine producers expand into the fast-growing emerging markets, protection of product
quality and brand integrity becomes increasingly important. Given the high excise duties charged in many
emerging markets on the sale of imported alcohol, emerging markets are highly susceptible to
counterfeiting of alcoholic beverages, especially premium brands. Safety closures, which provide significant
anti-counterfeiting protection to spirits manufacturers, are therefore important packaging components for
both producers and consumers, providing producers with an ability to protect their brand image and
integrity and consumers with the confidence that they are purchasing an authentic branded item that has
not been counterfeited.

The global closure market, including Roll-on for wine and Spirits, is expected to grow at
approximately 2% annually from 2021 to 2024, mainly driven by the Spirits “Safety and Luxury” segment
with its increasing penetration as well as “Roll-on for wine screw caps” segment, almost in line with
historical trends (3-5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024). As a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, the
Closure global market decreased by 8% in 2020 (representing a four billion units drop) to reach 55 billion
units. Preliminary indications for 2021 show that the market has almost entirely recovered since then.

Guala is currently heavily focused on Roll-on for wine and spirits with sizeable presence across all key
regions. Europe remains the largest market for Guala, representing 59% of its 2019 total net revenue by
main geographical segment (i.e., based on the geographical location of the subsidiary of the Group that
records the revenue rather than the location of the customer), followed by Americas and Asia regions
which represent respectively 18% and 13% of 2019 net revenue.

**Spirits closures market**

The spirits market consists of brandy and cognac, liqueurs, rum, whisky, tequila and mezcal, white
spirits (such as vodka) and other specialty spirits. Spirits closures typically have high client stickiness owing
to their low incidence on final price/packaging cost making switching an unnecessary risk. At the same
time, client relationship key drivers are proximity, caps performance and customisation (especially on
Luxury) since closures are key to preserve organoleptic properties and to enhance branding.

There are several types of closures for Spirits, categorised in four segments: (i) Roll-on, (ii) Safety,
(iii) Luxury and (iv) Other. Guala’s core products focus on Roll-on, Safety and Luxury segments, which
represent 71%, 23% and 6% of the Spirits markets, respectively.

The Roll-on segment is mainly comprised of low price brands and more generally smaller bottle sizes.
The main product from Guala is the Roll-on ROPP closure with basic tamper proofing, aluminium. This
segment represents a true opportunity in terms of costs, as it is the lowest cost option-technology at scale.

However, traceability is compromised with production and source information which can be easily
counterfeited.

The Safety segment consists of several offerings from more basic low-cost plastic systems to more
complex combinations of advanced anti-refill and tamper-evident. The main product from Guala is the
Anti-Refill insert (basic plastic insert) beneath with aluminium ROPP closure. This segment is mainly
driven by guaranteed quality to consumer from both tamper and anti-refill, with product source traceable
and verifiable.

The Luxury segment includes a wide range of bespoke and Luxury closures. Guala offers a wide range
of closures in this segment, from ROPP+ closures with additional basic Decoration added to one-off
customized designs for highly premium products. This segment is driven by branding and customization,
with high quality perception and unique propositions. However, the relative cost is lower as high cost per
unit is applied but on higher priced bottles.

Safety and Luxury segments have been out-performing the overall market with solid historical trend
and strong outlook towards 2024. Guala is well positioned on both segments with a clear leadership on
Safety (45-55% market share in 2019). There is sizeable growth available in East Europe due to further
shift from grey spirits to official alcohol, as well as in India where solid future growth is forecasted, driven
by ongoing premiumisation and safety focus. India is one of Guala’s most dominant markets, with 50-60%
market share in 2019 in the Safety segment, and has a high forecasted annual growth of 5.8% from 2021 to
2024. Similarly, the United States is an important market for Guala, expected to grow at 4.4% annually
from 2021 to 2024, where Guala is the market leader (holding 55-65% market share in 2019). Finally, the
United Kingdom, with an expected 6.5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024) and Mexico, with an expected
3.3% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, are both countries where Guala Closures has a strong presence, with
approximately 50% and 70% market share, respectively, in 2019.

The Spirits closures market has grown at approximately 2% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, reaching
approximately 18 billion caps in focus regions, which are India, Russia, USA, UK, Poland, Ukraine and
Mexico. In such period, “Roll-on” closures remained almost flat with market share of approximately 42%
share, unlike the “Safety” caps which reached 38% share growing faster at approximately 4% CAGR.
Therefore, Safety closures are taking market share on Roll-on markets. The fastest growing segment has
been “Luxury” with approximately 8% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, with a limited penetration
(approximately 5%). The COVID-19 epidemic has severely impacted the closure industry, resulting in an
approximately 9% decrease, with a strong rebound expected in 2021 and full recovery expected to be
achieved between 2021 and 2022, depending on country by country dynamics. The post pandemic growth
trends at approximately 2.5% annual growth between 2021 and 2024 are expected to be driven by positive
outlook mainly in India, United States, United Kingdom and Mexico, with “Safety” and “Luxury” as
top-growing segments.

**_Closure global market (Wine and Spirits), 2016-2024 (bn units)_**

The Spirits’ closures market is Guala’s core market. In 2019, Guala’s addressable market accounted
for more than 70% of the total spirits packaging market (or approximately 37 billion units out of
approximately 52 billion units). This includes metal screw and cork closures.

122


-----

Guala focuses on using product range and relationships with longstanding customers to “upsell” from
basic to more sophisticated closures, with increasing value add which leads to higher price realization.

There is a strong market growth trend that is expected to continue to strengthen in the next few years
with Safety and Luxury being the most attractive spirits segments, with an expected annual growth for the
Safety segment close to 4% between 2021 and 2024 and 5% for Luxury segment in the same period. The
Roll-on segment is expected to grow at a lower rate of 1% between 2021 and 2024.

Despite having similar trends across countries, several peculiarities and/or differentiated scenarios
should be considered, especially in terms of consumer habits, COVID-19 impact and closure type growth
trends, which require a country-by-country analysis:

   - India: the overall market is expected to grow from approximately 8.3 billion units in 2021 to
approximately 9.4 billion units in 2024 at a 4.2% CAGR over the same period. Safety closures are
expected to grow from 4.5 to 5.3 billion units over the same period, with Guala holding
approximately 50 to 60% market share, being the leader in such market). Safety closures are
expected to continue gaining market share from Roll-on closures (which are expected to grow from
2.7 to 2.9 billion units between 2021 and 2024) achieving approximately 6% CAGR between 2021
and 2024. COVID-19 had a severe impact on the Indian market, mainly as a result of the
restrictions adopted by the government (e.g., the 40-day ban), and a full rebound is expected in
2022. The macro-economic downturn is mostly impacting the Roll-on closure sector (consisting of
approximately 2.8 billion units in 2019), which are typically used on cheaper “country liquor”
bottles); it is expected that after the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic dissolve, demographic and
social shift towards upper classes will continue, driving higher quality spirits consumption which
would in turn positively increase demand for Safety closures (that are mainly applied to more
expensive spirits).

  - Russia: the overall market is expected to decrease by a 0.1% CAGR between 2021 and 2024 with
approximately 4.4 billion units expected to be sold between 2021 and 2024. The Roll-on segment is
expected to be the most relevant category (with approximately 1.9 billion units in 2024), with Guala
ranking second with an estimated market share of 10 to 20%). Roll-on closures are expected to lose
market shares by 2024 to Safety (with approximately 1.5 billion units in 2024) and Luxury (with
approximately 0.6 billion units in 2024), due to a trend towards premiumization.

  - United States: The Closure market is expected to grow at approximately 2% CAGR between 2021
and 2024, with approximately 1.7 and 1.8 billion units sold in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Roll-on
closures and other closures represent the over 90% of total market); however, it is expected that
Safety closures (in which Guala holds a market share of over 50%) will gain market share.

  - United Kingdom: The Roll-on market had approximately 62% market share in 2019. The overall
closure market is expected to increase by 2.6% annually between 2021 and 2024 (from
approximately 1.5 to approximately 1.6 billion units in 2021 and 2024, respectively), supported by a
rebound in local consumption after decreasing by 11% in 2020 compared to the previous year. It is
expected that in 2022 the market will recover to the 2019 pre-COVID-19 levels.

  - Poland and Ukraine: Poland is expected to grow at 0.5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024 (with
approximately 0.9 and approximately 1.0 billion units sold in 2021 and 2024, respectively). The
Polish market is focused on Roll-on closures (with approximately 75% market share), which trend is
expected to continue. The Ukraine market is expected to decline by 0.5% CAGR between 2021 and
2024 (with approximately 0.6 billion units expected to be sold 2024), Luxury closures (representing
approximately 25% market share) are expected to further grow supported by the trend of
premiumization. Both the Polish and Ukraine markets are expected to recover to the 2019
pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022.

   - Mexico: The closure market (with approximately 0.6 billion units expected to be sold in 2024) is
strictly tied to export dynamics (mainly of tequila). The market is fairly balanced between Roll-on
and Safety closures (with Guala Closures holding approximately 60 to 70% market share in the
Safety sector), with Safety closures expected to gain approximately 1% in 2024 compared to 2021,
supported by the trend of premiumization. The overall closure market is expected to grow at 3%
CAGR between 2021 and 2024. The Closure market is expected to recover to pre-COVID-19 level
in 2021.

123

India and the United States are driving most of the growth in the closure markets, driven by strong
consumption dynamics. China’s growth is driven by increasing premiumization, which offsets substantially
flat consumption levels. The following table shows the expected volumes of the spirits closures market in

Overall, Guala is a leading supplier of closures in the Spirits market. In particular, Guala is market
leader in the supply of Roll-on closures with a market share of approximately 10 to 15% in 2019, followed
by its closest competitor Amcor, with a market share of approximately 3% to 5%, a fragmented tail of
packaging generalists (e.g., Berry), with a market share of approximately 25% to 35%, collectively, and
small local players with a market share of approximately 25% to 35%, collectively. In such competitive
landscape, Guala is the market leader in Poland, Ukraine and Mexico, and the second player in Russia, the
United Kingdom and the United States.

124


-----

Guala is the global leader also in the Safety closure market, with a market share of approximately
45% to 55% in 2019, thus being the market leader in India, Mexico, the United States, Poland, Nigeria and
Colombia and holding a market share substantially in line with the second biggest competitor in the
United Kingdom, Ukraine and Russia. In terms of market share, Guala is followed by Amcor, with a
market share in the same year of approximately 4 to 7%, Torrent, a tail of small and less organized
producers (e.g., Alcopak) with an overall market share of approximately 25 to 35% and certain other
bigger competitors having a market share of approximately 20 to 25%.

The Luxury market is a very fragmented and niche market with highly-specialized suppliers (including
Tapi-Delage, with a market share of approximately 8% to 10% in 2019, and Segede, with a market share of
approximately 3% to 5%) in the same year and a high potential for consolidation opportunities, which
would allow reaching new clients and geographies. Guala is the only scale player in the Luxury market with
a market share in 2019 of approximately 6% to 8% in a fragmented market in which approximately 75% to
80% of the market share is represented by small local players.

**Roll-on for winecap closures market**

The Roll-on for wine closures market comprises traditional corks, synthetic corks and aluminium
Roll-on for winecaps, with corks traditionally being the predominant type of Roll-on for wine closure.
However, there has recently been increased adoption of aluminium Roll-on for winecaps, due to certain
advantages, including improved preservation of the organoleptic properties of Roll-on for wine, consumer
preference for ease of use and storage, and lower cost of packaging. Corks, which deteriorate over time, do
not perform as well when travelling long distances over extended periods of time and often cause
contamination of the Roll-on for wine. Moreover, Roll-on for winecaps are not susceptible to natural cork
taint issues and therefore substantially reduce risk of spoiling. As a result, we have seen significant growth
in the metal screw cap market in recent years as Roll-on for wine producers, wholesalers and retailers
increasingly substitute metal for cork Roll-on for winecaps. We believe that metal screw caps today
account for approximately 23% of all bottled Roll-on for wine worldwide and we believe that Guala is well
positioned to capitalize on future growth in this industry.

Screw cap market volumes depend on the adoption of bottled liquids and the adoption of screw caps.

On the one hand, bottled volume drivers depend on domestic demand (with Roll-on for wine volumes
driven by population and per capita consumption); production (with volumes produced by the national
Roll-on for wineries impacting import share of consumption); volumes of imported and exported bulk and
bottled Roll-on for wines; and size of packaging (with bottle formats changes impacting the number of
closure compared to the actual volumes of Roll-on for wine being sold).

On the other hand, the screw cap penetration depends on, among others, consumer acceptance (with
consumer preference and habits being slow and difficult to change, with traditional European countries
historically preferring cork over screwcaps); production landscape (fragmented Roll-on for wineries versus
fewer concentrated large importer can favor the adoption of screw cap over corks); export share and
consumer preferences of recipient countries (high exporting countries can based their decision on the
adoption of screwcaps on the preferences of end consumers in the countries where the Roll-on for wine is
dispatched); and retailer penetration (with retailer preferring screwcaps as there is less risk of return for
tainted Roll-on for wine).

Guala is the global leader in the screwcaps attractive market (with a market share of approximately
25 to 35% and approximately 7 billion of units sold in 2019 and 2020), growing at 3% CAGR between 2016
and 2019, due to evolving consumer habits, and the ability of screwcaps to preserve production quality
while having a low incidence on the price and costs of packaging. Furthermore, the screwcap market has
also demonstrated a higher resiliency to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the overall
closure market, showing a strong rebound in 2021, further boosted by an approximately 3% CAGR growth
expected between 2021 and 2024 and approximately 8 billion of units expected to be sold in 2024.

The overall 32 billion units Roll-on for wine closures market showed a slow but steady growth
between 2016 and 2019 of 1% CAGR, which is expected to continue over the next years, supported by
stable consumption in “Roll-on for wine countries” due to the undergoing product innovation and a
broader consumer base.

Screwcaps overall market was supported by favorable trends such as practicality, sustainability,
enhanced performance and reduced or stable cost, with the screwcap market representing approximately
23% of the overall closure market in 2019 and further growth expectation in the next years (as it is
expected to increase at a slow but steady rate of up to approximately 24% in 2024.

125


-----

Europe, the United States, China and certain other geographic areas spread across the globe
represent the most important Roll-on for wine regions for Guala:

  - Europe: representing approximately 54% of the overall market in 2019, the European market has
grown at 2% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, and it is expected to recover to 2019 levels by 2021
after a 7% decline in 2020, and then to grow by 2% CAGR in 2021. Guala has a strong presence in
the area, with a market share of approximately 25% in 2019, ranking first in most countries and
facing low competition from a limited number of local players. After declining by 1% CAGR
between 2010 and 2016, the Roll-on for wine market remains substantially flat until 2016-2019,
supported new products (e.g., Roll-on for wine rosé) perceived as healthier and able to address a
broader customer base (such as young generations, women). We expect this trend to continue post
the COVID-19 pandemic. Within such market, growth is entirely driven by increasing screwcap
penetration which shows a slow but steady trend in countries such as Spain, Italy and France, while
it is reaching saturation in UK and Germany where screwcaps already represented approximately
50% of the overall market in 2019.

   - United States: the United States represent an attractive region (representing approximately 10% of
screwcap market in 2021) and it is further expected to grow by approximately 5% CAGR between
2021 and 2024, driven by a positive trend in the Roll-on for wine market which is preferred over
other beverages. Guala is the third biggest player in the U.S. market with a market share of
approximately 10 to 20% in 2019.

   - China: while the screwcap market represented only approximately 5% of total market in 2019, it is
expected to grow at approximately 10% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by increasing
penetration of Roll-on for wine culture in the Chinese drinking habits and by a slight increase of
use of screwcap closures in the market.

   - Other: among the geographies in which Guala Closures operate, four areas account for
approximately 30% of the market:

      - Australia and New Zealand, which account for approximately 15% of market share, record a
strong use of screwcap closures that saturated the market, with this trend been in line with
the overall Roll-on for wine market which is expected to grow at approximately 2% between
2021 and 2024;

      - Chile and South Africa record a strong use of screwcap closures, resulting in approximately
4% expected growth between 2021 and 2024.

We believe that our global footprint and technologically advanced facilities, blue-chip customer base,
technology and innovation and effective cost control provide us with a competitive advantage over other
closures producers and make it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete in the
markets in which we sell our products. Our position is further consolidated by our extensive IP portfolio,
with, as of March 31, 2021, over 170 active patents and other IP rights related to the design and
manufacture of closures, and continuous product innovation (over 35 new products have been launched
over the last three years).

We are the leading producer of safety closures by volume of units sold in a number of countries,
including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. Notably, safety, closures are primarily used in emerging
markets where there is a high risk of counterfeiting of alcohol. In addition, we are the leading
manufacturer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Poland
(from where we serve the European market) and South Africa.

We have a wide customer portfolio, which includes blue-chip major international and regional brands
with whom we have built long-term relationships lasting more than 30 years in certain cases. We supply the
top 10 premium spirits brands worldwide, including McDowell’s, Johnnie Walker, Bacardi, Jack Daniel’s
and Absolut. The breadth and diversity of our customer base results in no single brand accounting for
more than 3% of our net revenue during the last three years.

Over the past decade, we have developed a strong focus on sustainability and ESG issues and strived
to reduce the impact of our products and operations on the environment and climate change. We have
made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and continuously focus, together with
selected partners, on the study, prototyping and development of closures made of materials with a low
environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and recycled polymers as well as
biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials represented 27% of the raw materials
used in our products. In November 2020, we launched a new range of sustainable products under the
umbrella brand Blossom[™] and in December 2020, we signed an exclusivity agreement with Oceanworks[®],
the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, in order to develop a line of T-bar closures

manufactured using fully recycled ocean-diverted plastic. We are committed to reducing the impact of our
operations and wider value chain on the environment by reducing waste, increasing energy and water
savings and using renewable energy, which is well-aligned with our focus on staying at the forefront of
product innovation. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per
ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016. With plants and offices in 25 countries
and customers from over 100 countries, we also place great importance on diversity and inclusion as well as
talent recruitment and management. As of March 31, 2021, the percentage of women holding leadership
positions was 20.0% compared to 15.9% in 2018. In addition, following the appointment of the new board
of directors on April 30, 2021, 44% of the members of our board of directors are women.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we generated net revenue of €564.4 million, loss of
€0.2 million, EBIT of €31.5 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of €98.2 million, resulting in an Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 17.4%. We believe that our high margins are supported by our raw material cost
management and our ability to manage raw material price fluctuations, global diversity and exposure to
growth markets and ongoing management initiatives to improve production efficiencies.

**Competitive strengths**

We believe we have the following competitive strengths:

**_Market leader in safety closures for spirits and roll-on for wine closures_**

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, in 2019, the global
spirits closures market reached approximately 51 billion of units sold, of which approximately 18 billion
units in our key focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine
and Mexico, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.0% between
2021 and 2024, primarily driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, especially in the
United States and India. According to the same study, Guala’s global addressable Roll-on and Safety
closures markets reached approximately 37 billion units in 2019 (compared to 33 billion in 2016). In
addition, the global market for Roll-on for wine closures reached approximately 32 billion units in 2019
(compared to 30 billion units in 2016) and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 2.0% between 2021 and 2024. We believe we are the market leader in the production of
Safety closures for spirits with a market share by volume of units sold worldwide of more than 60%, and
the leading producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures for the wine industry with a market share by
volume of units sold of approximately 30%, in each case in 2019. We estimate that in 2019, our market
shares for Safety and Roll-on for wine closures was six and four times greater than that of our nearest
competitor, respectively. We also believe that we are a leading producer of aluminum closures for spirits in
Europe. We believe that our leadership positions are sustainable due to our commitment to quality,
research and development efforts, proprietary production technologies, long-standing customer
relationships, excellent customer service and brand recognition.

We are a renowned as a key partner in the spirits markets and sell our safety closures to some of the
most prestigious multinational producers of spirits as well as a number of important regional producers in
many of the countries in which we operate. For a spirits producer, packaging and brand are key elements
in product identification and differentiation. Through technological innovation, we offer closures that
enable our customers to better differentiate and position their brands against their competitors. We
believe that the market for safety closures for spirits, including in emerging markets where premium
brands are penetrating further, will continue to grow. See “Industry Overview”. Our safety closures help
global manufacturers of spirits to protect against counterfeiting, particularly in emerging markets where
the risk of counterfeiting is higher. As a result, we believe that we are the leading manufacturer of safety
closures in various emerging countries, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. Both global and
local manufacturers of spirits also use safety and luxury closures to differentiate their brands.

Our aluminum screwcaps for wine closures are designed to facilitate opening and closing the bottle
and feature liners that keep the oxygenation of the wine in check so the wine retains its quality and flavour
longer. In this market, we serve some of the major wine producers as well as a number of important
regional players, such as Casella in New Zealand, Distell in South Africa and The Wine Group in the
United States. We expect that the market for aluminum screwcaps for wine closures will continue to grow
due to the advantages of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures over traditional cork closures. We believe
that we are well placed to benefit from this growth because of our ability to cross-sell to manufacturers
who also sell spirits, our capacity for decoration and design, the economies of scale permitted by our

extensive distribution network and the proximity of several of our plants to “New World” wine producers
in Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.

The strength and global reach of our platform is supported by our decentralized sales structure with a
wide network of local area managers, which enables us to be in close proximity to our key customers
worldwide, allowing us to establish and foster close relationships with industry players across geographies.
We believe our proximity to our customers enhances our ability to respond quickly to changing local
trends. In addition, our global scale enables us to source capacity from different locations based on supply
and demand levels so that we can serve our customers across multiple geographies depending on their
needs and requirements. As a result, we are able to develop new products and value added solutions that
meet the requirements of customers in our key end-markets while limiting our labor costs and creating
production synergies, all of which positions us well for future growth.

Our global platform of technologically advanced facilities is equipped with state-of-the-art
technologies, processing solutions, quality controls and machinery. Over the years, we have developed
proprietary production technologies that are crucial for the manufacture of technologically advanced
closures. As part of our efforts to make our manufacturing process more efficient by leveraging on
technological innovations, we regularly pilot and implement various projects across our manufacturing
facilities, including a multi-injection project in our facility in Colombia to develop closures made of
different plastics in the same mould in order to eliminate the assembly stage of our production process and
provide significant additional anti-counterfeiting protection to our closures. In addition, we focus on widescale flexible automation of our productions processes, which we plan to implement also for small and
medium-sized product batches. As customers increasingly demand more product customization, we believe
that our technologically advanced facilities position us to adapt to this market trend and meet the
increasingly complex specifications of our customers.

**_Long-standing and trusted blue chip customer relationships, high switching costs and diverse customer base_**

Our consistent product quality and customer service have allowed us to develop strong and longstanding relationships with our customers, both in mature and emerging markets. We enhance customer
loyalty through our research and development activities, which are often driven by the specific business
requirements of our customers. We have strong and long-standing relationships with most of the large
global producers of spirits, including Bacardi, Brown Forman, Campari, Diageo and Pernod Ricard, and
we work closely with individual brands owned by these producers. We also serve major wine producers,
such as Accolade, Castel, Caviro and Torres, Concha y Toro, Constellations Brands, Pernod Ricard and
Treasury wines. In addition, we serve a broad range of regional and local producers of spirits and wines
across all of our geographies. In 2020, approximately 30% and 70% of our net revenues was generated

130


-----

from sales of products to global and regional spirits producers, respectively. We have long-term
relationships with many of our customers, which in some cases exceed 30 years.

Due to the nature of bottle closures, we work in close partnership with leading spirits and wines
producers in the study, prototyping and development of highly innovative closures specifically designed for
their end-products, particularly safety and luxury closures, which often become integral parts of the overall
packaging design featured in their advertising campaigns. For example, we have developed the “Neptune”
closure for the SKYY Vodka brand, the “Florence” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Ballantine’s in both open
pourer and non-refillable versions and the luxury quality “Ultis” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Chivas
Whiskey. In recent years, the trend for customized solutions has resulted in the increase of the share of
products that we co-design and co-develop with our customers, particularly for luxury closures. For
example, we currently co-develop all of the luxury closures with premium spirit brands including, among
others, Macallan, William Grant’s, Haig Club, Dewar’s. The trend for customized solutions has also driven
the co-development of highly customized Safety closures with brands such as Jose Cuervo, Khortitsa and
Russian Standard. At the same time, we continue to develop products that can be sold to all customers in
specific end-markets, particularly in the wine and water closures market.

The high degree integration of our closures with customers’ end-products and the fact that our
closures are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection, makes it more difficult
and costly for our customers to source alternative closures from our competitors. In addition, our longstanding, collaborative relationships with leading brands and our ability to leverage our global platform to
serve their needs across multiple geographies have allowed our closures to be used in our customers’
products globally, often becoming industry standard. In safety closures, we are typically the sole supplier
for a particular brand in a particular region. At the same time, our customer base is largely diversified and,
while certain of our customers own multiple brands, no single brand accounted for more than 3% of our
net revenue in 2019 and 2020.

As a result of the time and resources invested in joint product development activities with customers,
we also often receive recognition. For example, the e-closures equipped with NeˇSTGATE[™] NFC
technology that we launched in 2020 with Vigneti Massa, a well-established winemaker located in
Piedmont, Italy, received three prestigious awards in 2019: the Alufoil Trophy, the SIMEI Innovation
Challenge and the WorldStar Award. In addition, in February 2020 we received, together with Vigneti
Massa, a special prize for innovation in the wine sector at the inaugural Food & Wine Italia Awards.

We believe that the multinational scope of our operations and our ability to meet our customers’
quality standards across geographic markets are increasingly important factors to our large global
customers. In addition, our international presence allows us to operate in close physical proximity to our
customers’ production facilities and meet their product and design requirements with greater flexibility
and at a more competitive price and quality than our competitors.

**_Highly differentiated proprietary engineered product portfolio supported by a strong focus on research and_**
**_development_**

We believe that a key reason for our strong positioning in the global markets is the wide range of
products in our portfolio, which we sell to customers operating in four key end-markets: spirits, wine, water
and beverages, and olive oil and condiments. Our safety closures, which are highly engineered packaging
components generally consist of two to 12 different components, range from tamper-evident seals to more
sophisticated non-refillable devices covering the medium to high value added range of the closures market.
Our luxury closures, typically designed for high-end spirits produced in limited quantities, are made of
both aluminum and plastic, are customized according to the requirements of our customers and can
include ribbons, seals and unusual shapes. Our roll-on closures and other product lines provide a range of
products for spirits and mineral water and often provides an entry point for up-selling customers to other
higher value added product lines. Our roll-on for wine closures are made from aluminum and customers
can choose whether or not to include a tamper-evident band for protection against counterfeiting.

In line with our long-term commitment to design sustainable solutions and increasing customer focus
on sustainability in their own products, we recently developed and launched several sustainable solutions,
such as products of our Blossom[™] line, including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum
screwcap made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic
and agglomerated cork that we developed in collaboration with Oceanworks[®], the largest global
marketplace for sustainable materials, and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a
tamper-evident ring produced from completely bio-based polymers.

Our research and development capabilities and our customer service functions enable us to
continuously improve and expand our product offering, including in response to customer feedback, and
the solutions we develop are often proprietary in nature and covered by patents, trade secrets and
know-how, all of which ensures our product portfolio remains differentiated.

**_Focus on innovation, technology and product development_**

We are committed to product research and development and the digitalization of packaging, and we
believe that we are a leading innovator in the closures industry, with a record of developing new and
enhanced products with improved functionality, reliability and sustainability. In addition, the increased
interconnectivity of our closures leads to closer integration between packaging suppliers and customers
during the designing, ordering and delivering phases as closures are closely tailored to customers’ needs.
We focus on the study, prototyping and development of highly engineered innovative solutions together
with selected partners, particularly for safety closures, and we protect our know-how by applying for
patents and other intellectual property protections for our products and processes. As of March 31, 2021,
we held, or had lodged applications for, more than 170 patents, including 113 active patent families,
10 utility model families, 5 combined patents and utility model families and 44 protected industrial designs.
Patents covered approximately 29% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. The
proprietary nature of our products makes it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively
compete with us, as our research and development capabilities allow us to strengthen our relationships
with customers.

We operate five research and development centers in Italy, Scotland, Mexico, Ukraine and
Luxembourg. We believe that our developments allow us to derive a significant competitive advantage in
our markets because more advanced products generally provide us with higher margins. During the last
three years, we have launched over 35 new products. Examples of some of our most recent innovations
include various e-closures with fully integrated NFC capabilities, including our new series of e-closures
under the NeˇSTGATE[™] brand, which we started to develop in 2018, including the first wine bottles
equipped with NFC technology in Europe, which we launched in partnership with Vigneti Massa in 2020,
and e-closures specifically designed for Irish whiskey Jameson, which we launched in 2020. The NFC
technology is revolutionizing conventional bottle packaging by integrating connectivity features into bottle
closures for spirits, wine, olive oil and beverages. In particular, our NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures are equipped
with a special microchip inside the capsule that is readable by all compatible smartphones, without
downloading any specific application, providing consumers with the certification of authenticity and
unlocking all information about the product, directly linking them to the brand and boosting customer
engagement and loyalty. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] product range also comprises various QR code-based as well
as more basic serial number-based models for wine and beverages. Most recently, we designed an
electronic tamper-evident closure equipped with proximity sensors capable of detecting nearby objects in
partnership with NXP Semiconductors, which we plan to launch in the coming months. Following our
recent acquisition of a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services
agency based in London, we are able to offer our customers turnkey solutions, including digital platforms,
integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions.

We also have developed proprietary manufacturing processes that help reduce our operating costs
and improve our profitability. In certain cases, we work with our customers to develop new and more
competitive products. By offering support and by providing the technical expertise and service needed to
develop new products, we have enhanced our relationships with our customers. In addition, in order to
refresh our current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our
research and development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual
brands and equipped with innovative technological and sustainable features and with a sophisticated
design, which we expect to launch between 2021 and 2023.

**_Proven track record of successful acquisitions focused on creating long-term value_**

Over the past two decades, our growth has been complemented through strategically identified
acquisitions and other business combinations and investments, which enabled us to strengthen our market
position and further increase our market share. In doing so, we have increased the number of geographical
markets in which we operate, including Australia, Bulgaria, France, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine,
Belarus, Germany and Turkey and have expanded our presence in new segments and the types of products
which we offer, including aluminum screwcaps for wine closures. More recently, in 2018, we acquired
United Closures and Plastics (now called Guala Closures UCP), a Scottish company with a long-standing

132


-----

presence in the Scottish market, which supplies some landmark scotch whisky brands. In 2020, we acquired
Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the
glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we
acquired a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in
London focusing on integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions, which we
increased from 20% to 30% in the first quarter of 2021. We believe that we have been successful at
identifying and integrating acquired companies within the Group and at delivering synergies. Our success
in identifying and integrating acquired companies has contributed to the diversification of our geographic
and product category profile and the maintenance of attractive margins.

**_Best-in-class financial profile with proven resilience, with a decade of strong Adjusted EBITDA margins despite_**
**_foreign exchange rate and raw materials price fluctuations_**

We manage our business with a focus on achieving and maintaining a strong Adjusted EBITDA
margin as compared to those of our industry peers. We have a strong track-record of more than a decade
of revenue growth and stability of Adjusted EBITDA margins within a very narrow and consistent range.
We believe our business is resilient against the impact of adverse foreign exchange movements and raw
materials price fluctuations. Furthermore, we believe that the diversified nature of our end-markets and
customer base, coupled with our global presence have allowed us to maintain strong performance in 2020
despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are supported
by hedging arrangements covering a portion of our costs for raw materials via forward contracts. From
time to time, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are impacted by the initial dilutive effect of strategic
acquisitions; however, we strive to support our acquired businesses in order to maintain high group-wide
margins as we strive to achieve industry leading profitability. As a result, we believe our average Adjusted
EBITDA margin from 2015 to 2020 (including pre-merger Guala) was one of the three highest among our
direct competitors within the industry.

Our profit/(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2021, represented 2.4%, (1.0)% and (0.0%), respectively, of our net revenue. We have achieved
strong Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.7%, 17.1% and 17.4% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, and in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. We were able to achieve these results
leveraging both organic and inorganic growth, in spite of the fluctuations in exchange rates and raw
material prices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the economic recovery starting in
the third and fourth quarter of 2020, our sales volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, while
our net revenue in 2020 decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019,
our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to
€603.8 million from €606.5 million in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, our overall sales volumes continued
to improve despite the loss of volumes from sales in the European water and beverage market, which was
negatively impacted by the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries due to the COVID-19
pandemic. As a result, while net revenue decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, from €145.9 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €138.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, our Net
Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the first quarter of 2021 increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9%, from
€145.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 to €147.2 million. Our resilient industry leading margins coupled
disciplined approach to working capital and capital expenditure led to a strong Adjusted cash conversion
ratio of 88% in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. The above information should be
read in conjunction with the information contained in “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”,
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

**_Strong focus on ESG and sustainability by pursuing ambitious targets_**

Over the past decade, we have developed a strong focus on sustainability and ESG issues and
strived to reduce the impact of our products and operations on the environment and climate change.
Going forward, we intend to continue to focus on sustainability and ESG and have developed a
comprehensive strategy to optimize sustainability across our operations and identified a series of
sustainability targets. We have made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and
have been, together with selected partners, studying, prototyping and developing closures made of
materials with a low environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and
recycled polymers as well as biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials
represented 27% of the raw materials used in our products and we intend to increase this percentage to
35% by the end of 2025. Our product portfolio already comprises several sustainable products under the

133


-----

umbrella brand Blossom[™], including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap
made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and
Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from
completely bio-based polymers. In line with our long-term commitment on sustainability, we intend to
increase the share of environmentally-friendly solutions in our portfolio, by extending our existing range
of sustainable closures and developing new solutions.

In order to protect the environment, meet sustainability needs and contribute to the mitigation of the
effects of climate change, we focus on minimizing environmental pollution, reducing waste, increasing
energy and water savings and using renewable energy. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope
1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016,
and we intend to decrease such emissions further by optimizing processes and optimizing loads and
logistics across our supply chain. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, we implemented “Iris”, a new
software developed entirely in-house, at our Spinetta Marengo facility in Italy, which is able to connect
150 pieces of machinery simultaneously, perform data analysis and make recommendations to the facility’s
operator in line with our key sustainability principles. Going forward, we plan to implement Iris at all our
facilities worldwide.

**_Experienced and committed management team supported by clear and simple reporting lines and a decentralized_**
**_sales structure_**

We benefit from the experience of our key management who each have decades of experience in the
closures and packaging industry. In addition, in 2021 we welcomed our new Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. Gabriele del Torchio, who brings a wealth of experience in running high profile businesses and a track
record of approximately 45 years in managing industrial companies. Management has consistently
demonstrated its ability to develop our business by anticipating market trends and dynamics, creating
significant added value for customers and entering new geographies and product markets, underpinned by
clear and simple reporting lines directly to the Chief Operating Officer, who is supported by two regional
managers for the Americas and the Asia Pacific region, and by decentralized local sale structure with a
strong network of area managers responsible for day-to-day relationships with local customers. Our
effective management structure has also allowed us to take swift action in response to the weak global
economic environment in past years, including headcount reductions, temporary plant shutdowns and exits
from non-core markets, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, management has
continued to implement cost reduction measures and to improve cash flow management while pursuing
our strategy to enter new geographies and product markets through organic growth and by acquiring and
successfully integrating companies already operating in our industry.

**Business strategy**

We aim to maintain our market leadership as a large-scale producer of specialty closures and to
continue growing our business while enhancing our profitability by growing our revenue, reducing our cost
base and expanding our product portfolio. Our strategy to achieve these objectives includes the following
key elements:

**_Continue to invest in product development and digitalization and cross-sell or up-sell high end products to existing_**
**_customers_**

Competition in our key market segments is focused mainly on product quality, innovation,
digitalization, sustainability and customer service. As a result, we believe that developing reliable products
with innovative functional features, aesthetic appeal and other improvements are necessary for enhancing
demand for our products. We plan to continue improving our product offering technologically and
innovatively by developing new ranges of safety closures that offer varying degrees of protection against
counterfeiting while promoting our customers’ brand images worldwide. In particular, we plan to continue
to focus on the digitalization of our closures by offering more products equipped with innovative
technological features, such as NFC microchips and QR code-based solutions. We will continue to work
closely with our customers to develop new and more innovative solutions and we believe that the
increasing digitalization of closures will lead to even closer integration with our customers’ end-products
and will position us for further growth. In addition, we intend to develop new aesthetically appealing styles
to complement existing products and meet the growing marketing requirements of our customers. We also
intend to encourage customers of our roll-on closures to upgrade and convert to more sophisticated,
aesthetic, luxurious and protective safety closures where appropriate. In order to refresh our current

134


-----

product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our research and development
team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual brands and equipped with
innovative technological and sustainable solutions and with a sophisticated design, which we expect to
launch between 2021 and 2023.

**_Increase sales of premium products through a focus on safety and luxury closures across different geographies_**

In recent years, we have expanded our global presence and we believe we are the leading producer of
safety closures by volume in several emerging markets, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. In
2019, we started our operations in Africa following the inauguration of Guala Closures East Africa’s new
facility in Kenya and opened a new facility in Belarus. In 2020, we entered the Turkish market following
our acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH and its assets in Turkey. We intend to continue our geographical
expansion by consolidating our presence in these and other markets, with a particular focus on specialty
closures for the spirits market, including added-value safety and luxury closures.

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the global spirits
closures market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% between 2016 and
2019, reaching approximately 37 billion closures in 2019, of which approximately 18 billion units in our key
focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine and Mexico.
According to this study, the market for safety closures represented approximately 38% of the global spirits
closures market in 2019, while 42% was represented by roll-on closures. Despite the negative impact from
the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a 9% decrease in the size of the spirits closures market in our
key focus regions in 2020, a strong rebound is expected in 2021, with a full recovery predicted to occur
between 2021 and 2022, on a country-by-country basis. In particular, it is expected that the global spirits
closures market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.5% between 2021 and
2024, mainly driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, which are expected to grow at a
compound annual growth rate of approximately 4% and 5%, respectively, between 2021 and 2024.

We expect significant growth for the specialty closures segments in emerging markets. In recent years,
these markets have experienced an increase in the consumption of branded spirits. We believe this has
resulted in a greater demand for sophisticated anti-counterfeiting systems (such as our non-refillable safety
closures) by the producers of such spirits and we expect such demand to continue to grow. In addition,
producers are increasingly using safety closures as a marketing tool to create a premium brand image
through the use of exclusive packaging.

We believe that our leading position means that we are well placed to benefit from the expected
future growth in the safety closures market worldwide, including in emerging markets. We aim to take
advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence in these markets. We intend to achieve
this by strengthening our relationships with drinks producers and consolidating our presence and
infrastructure in the relevant countries.

**_Position the Group to benefit from expected growth in the market for wine closures and bottled water_**

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the aluminum
screwcaps for wine closures market grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% between
2016 and 2019, as a result of evolving consumer habits and the ability of screwcaps to preserve product
quality while having a low incidence on the price and costs of packaging. The screwcap market has also
demonstrated a higher resiliency to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the
overall closures market, showing a strong rebound in 2021 to date, which we expect will continue, and an
expected growth at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% between 2021 and 2024. We
believe that aluminum winecaps today account for approximately 23% of all bottled wine worldwide and
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth in this industry, especially as large
regions such as North America and Europe move towards greater usage of aluminum winecaps.

We believe we are one of the top producers of aluminum winecap closures, with a market share by
volume of units sold in 2019 of approximately 30%. We expect growth in the wine closures market to
continue due to increasing end-consumer preference for aluminum closures rather than cork. We believe
that our leading position in this market means we are well placed to benefit from this growth. We aim to
take advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence this end-market, by strengthening our
relationships with wine producers, particularly those which are also active in the spirits market, by
developing new and aesthetically attractive closures, including closures with safety elements and innovative
features, and by consolidating our operations in the countries and regions where wine closures are
purchased in large volumes.

135


-----

According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the market for
closures for bottled water, measured by closures unit, grew at a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 5% between 2015 and 2019, and is expected to grow further a compound annual growth rate
of approximately 6% between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by growth in population and increased shift
towards healthier beverages. In particular, the premium market for glass water bottles is expected to grow
at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7% over the same timeframe. We believe we are
currently recognized as a key closure producer in the premium market for glass water bottles, particularly
following our acquisition of Closurelogic, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures
mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, in 2020. Going forward, we intend
to take advantage of these strong growth trends in the glass-bottle closures market by leveraging our core
business technology in metal screw caps for spirit closures as well as our expertise in tamper-evident
systems.

**_Carry out further selected acquisitions in core and adjacent markets_**

During the last 10 years, we have grown both organically and through strategically identified
acquisitions. In doing so we have increased the number of geographical markets in which we operate (for
example, we established our presence in Australia, Bulgaria, France, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine,
Belarus, Germany and Turkey) and expanded our presence in new segments and the types of products
which we offer. Most recently, in 2018, we acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a
long-standing presence in the Scottish market, and in 2020, we acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German
manufacturer specialising in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral
water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we also acquired a minority stake in
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London focusing on
integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions. In the first quarter of 2021, we
increased our stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. from 20% to 30%. We believe that we have been
successful at identifying and integrating acquired companies and at exploiting the synergies offered by such
acquisitions. Going forward, we intend to continue to identify appropriate expansion opportunities where
we consider it would help us grow in new geographical markets with high levels of alcohol consumption
that we view as underpenetrated including, for example, South Africa and certain countries in Asia. In
addition, we intend to continue to identify appropriate acquisitions and other development opportunities
that would allow us to consolidate our position in the market for aluminum and plastics closures, and
diversify our business through the expansion in the market for closures made of alternative materials such
as cork as well as in adjacent product markets, such as food and beverages, including water, beauty and the
pharmaceutical industries.

**_Further improve operational efficiency by optimizing manufacturing and the supply chain_**

The optimization and automation of our manufacturing processes and the investment in new
equipment for our technologically advanced plants is one of our core areas of focus and going forward we
expect to continue to invest in innovative technologies for supply chain management in order to optimize
our production and supply chain network efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of our production
processes, we aim to (i) modernize and automate our production processes on a wide-scale through our
flexible automation project, including for small and medium-sized product batches, which we believe will
enable us to respond promptly to evolving market needs; (ii) continue to advance our production processes
by implementing systems to monitor and improve our entire production cycles (the “continuous
improvement” program) and our multi-injection project aimed at eliminating the assembly stage of the
manufacturing process; and (iii) hedge part of the risks of price fluctuation in the purchase price of
aluminum through forward purchases on the London Metal Exchange through the use of hedging
depending on the commodity price environment. We endeavor to leverage key focus platforms across the
Group and improve profitability of selected sites opportunistically.

**_Continue prudent financial management, focusing on liquidity, deleveraging, Net Working Capital and hedging of_**
**_raw materials_**

We believe that the Group has benefited from prudent financial management throughout its history,
with a particular focus on cost reduction and cash flow management. We intend to use our cash flow
generation capacity, and our Revolving Credit Facility, to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity and Net
Working Capital in order to enable us to respond to unexpected changes in economic conditions. We will
continue to monitor our capital expenditures carefully in order to benefit from favorable economic

136


-----

conditions and be able to take advantage of opportunities for acquisitions, and to continue to implement
the Group’s strategy, particularly in emerging markets. We will also continue to carefully monitor
fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, both aluminum and plastics, and changes in prevailing currency
exchange rates. We intend to manage raw material price fluctuations by hedging our exposures where
appropriate as well as currency fluctuations by matching revenue to expenditure in each currency where
possible.

**History**

We commenced operations in 1954 as a manufacturer of plastic closures for spirits. Early in our
development we adopted an international focus, initially by licensing our products to local producers and
later by establishing a direct presence in the markets we targeted. Over the last two decades, we have
expanded our product lines and geographic markets through both organic growth and acquisitions. Prior to
the 2018 Business Combination, our expansion has included the commencement in 2015 of production
operations in Chile, the acquisition in 2016 of 70% of CapMetal SAS in France (since renamed Guala
Closures France SAS), a company specialized in the production of aluminum screwcaps, and the
acquisitions in 2017 of Axiom, a leading Indian company active in the production of safety closures for
spirits, of the activities of Limat S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company specialized in the manufacturing of
wood overcaps for top-range spirit bottles, and of the screw cap activities of Industria Corchera S.A.
(“ICSA”) in Chile.

On July 31, 2018, pre-merger Guala, was acquired by Space4, a special purpose acquisition company
and it merged by incorporation into Space4 on August 6, 2018 with the resulting entity concurrently
adopting Guala’s corporate name, Guala Closures S.p.A., and transferring its registered office to Guala’s
registered office, Via Rana 12, 15122, Alessandria, Spinetta Marengo, Italy. On the same date, our
ordinary shares and Market Warrants were admitted to and started trading on the Star segment of the
Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato Telematico Azioniario) and in September 2019, we were admitted to the
FTSE Italy Mid Cap index.

Following our admission to trading on the Italian Stock Exchange, we continued the expansion of our
product lines and geographic reach. In 2018, we acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a
long-standing presence in the Scottish market, which supplies closures to some landmark scotch whisky
brands. In 2019, we started our operations in Africa following the inauguration of Guala Closures East
Africa’s new facility in Kenya and opened a new facility in Belarus. In 2020, we acquired Closurelogic
GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle
beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In 2020, we also acquired a minority
stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London focusing on
integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions, such as closures equipped with
NFC capabilities. The graphic below provides an overview of our key acquisitions, business combinations
and investments from 2002 to 2020.

**Our divisions and product lines**

We have historically divided our operations into two divisions: Closures and PET. The Closures
division represents our core business and produces a wide range of closures for diversified end-markets.
The PET division mainly produces standard and custom moulds, PET bottle and miniatures.

Our Closures division represents our core business, which is specialized in the following product lines:
Safety closures, Luxury closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine closures. Safety and Luxury
closures are specialty closures.

In 2019, we reorganized our business structure to focus on our Closures division. We sold part of the
Spanish assets of our PET division to third parties and transferred the remaining PET assets from Spain to
the United Kingdom. As a result, we no longer consider the PET division a core business. The PET
division is now closely connected to the Closures division as customers in the spirit sector are the same and
because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory market related to the sale of closures to
our customers. As a result of this reorganization, sales generated in our Closures division and from sales of
PET products accounted for 99.5% and 0.5% of our net revenue, respectively, in the year ended
December 31, 2020.

In 2019, following the partial divestment of our PET division and the sale of GCL Pharma S.r.l., which
operated our pharma product line, we changed the presentation of our segmentation by product. In
particular, we no longer consider it a core business of the Group and no longer report our PET revenues
separately. For reporting purposes, we include revenues from sales of products manufactured by our PET
division, together with residual revenues not in included in any of the other product lines, under the
residual category “Other”.

The following table shows the distribution of our net revenue by product line for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and the twelve months
ended March 31, 2021.

_Safety closures_

We produce safety closures almost exclusively for spirits, wine and vegetable oil products, which are
fitted with special devices to limit counterfeiting of the end-product, such as non-refillable devices. We are
the world’s leading producer of safety closures for spirits, with a market share by volume of units sold
worldwide in 2019 of more than 60%. Safety closures are primarily made of plastics and have a complex
structure that generally consist of two to 12 different components. Our safety closures are designed to
prevent our competitors from imitating our closures and their unique components. The features of our
safety closures products can include tamper-evident seals, non-refillable valve systems, positive lock
systems and aluminum cladding. Safety closures are primarily used by our customers when selling their
products in emerging markets, where the risk of counterfeiting is higher.

We have been active in the production of safety closures since the 1970s when we launched the
famous 1031 model safety closure. Most of our older patents related to the creation of innovative solutions
for tamper-evident and tamper proofing features in closures with these features being implemented
alongside new designs of plastic components and the interaction of plastic components with aluminum
shells. Our more recent patent applications take advantage of new technologies, in an innovative manner
and for the first time in the closures field, include production cost savings and sustainable methods (for
waste reduction) as well as improvements in the efficiency of tamper-evident and anti-counterfeiting
measures.

Safety closures are increasingly being used as a marketing tool to create a premium brand image
through exclusive packaging. In response to the needs of our customers who wish to distinguish their
brands, we also design and produce safety customized closures according to their specifications.

For each of the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we sold
approximately 4.2 billion Safety closures. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months
ended March 31, 2021, our Safety closures product line generated net revenue of €203.8 million and
€202.2 million, representing 35.6% and 35.8%, respectively, of our net revenue for the relevant period.

_Luxury closures_

Our luxury closures product line specializes in the production of customized plastic, wood and
aluminum closures, typically designed for high-end spirits that are produced in limited quantities. We focus
on aesthetic appeal and design and use advanced decoration techniques, including 3D embossing and
metal sputtering, to customize closures. These closures are designed to give a more distinctive character to
our customers’ brands and to improve the aesthetic appeal of their end-products. Luxury closures can be
designed to suit different brand and market requirements. Our leadership in the Safety and Roll-on
closures segments facilitated our penetration in the Luxury closures market, particularly because often the
customers of these closures are the same and we have been able to leverage our long-standing
relationships with their procurement, technical and marketing representatives for Safety and Roll-on
closures, who are typically also responsible of Luxury closures.

Our luxury closures collection includes:

   - Gravitas, closures made of a new patented material that brings together the versatility of plastic and
luxury feel of metal material;

   - Essence, customized closures made of high quality natural wood;

   - Icon, closures which feature a combination of materials and technologies that gives closures a
touchable appearance;

   - Torq, closures which combine the retention properties of a screw thread with the premium feel of a
cork; and

   - Opéra, closures made of eccentric materials with a noble and contemporary touch.

_Roll-on closures_

We produce roll-on closures for spirits, mineral water, vegetable oil and condiments sectors (such as
those for olive oil and vinegar). We believe that we are the largest producer of standard aluminum closures
in Europe. Our roll-on closures also include closures for bottles of soft drinks and beer. Our Roll-on
closures portfolio ranges from the simplest screwcaps to more customized solutions decorated with
advanced techniques, such as lithography, hot-foil, relief or bas-relief punching. Roll-on closures are
primarily made out of aluminum and can typically comprise up to four different components. Our products
comprise (i) long and short aluminum closures fitted with a thread enabling them to be screwed directly
onto the neck of the bottle and (ii) aluminum closures with plastic components enabling special functions,
such as anti-drop spouts (mainly designed for olive oil bottles) or flow inhibitors (mainly designed for
vinegar bottles).

We seek to, where appropriate, migrate customers from Roll-on closures to higher margin Safety
closures through a process of customer education and product innovation.

_Roll-on for wine closures_

Aluminum screwcap closures specifically dedicated to the wine sector are easy to open and convenient
to store as well as lower cost than traditional cork closures. Screwcap closures for wine offer further
advantage to natural and synthetic corks for bottled wine as screwcaps are not susceptible to natural cork
taint issues and, therefore, do not create a risk of spoiling the wine contained in the bottle. Demand for
aluminum screwcaps closures for wine has increased in recent years, and in 2020 aluminum screwcap
closures were used on approximately 23% of all bottled wine worldwide.

Flat coated and printed aluminum sheets are pressed to produce the closure shell, which is then
finished to meet the customer’s needs through the use of printing machines. Our Roll-on wine closures
product line includes a range of product and technological features, including decoration, concealed
threading, tamper-evident band, pressure retention and varying levels of permeability including by use of
controlled OTR liners. Our key Roll-on for wine closures include the Liners by Oneoseal[®], which we
started developing together with Manufacture Generale de Joints in 2015, including:

  - Onyx, liners equipped with an aluminum layer to ensure maximum impermeability to oxygen;

   - Ivory, liners that enable the amount of free sulfur dioxide (SO2) to be reduced when bottling; and

The market for aluminum screwcaps for wine closures continues to grow strongly as a result of the
superior performance of aluminum closures compared to traditional cork closures. The market growth has
been driven by wine producers in New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa, which
preferred aluminum screwcaps over cork ones for various reasons, including practicality of use and cost
benefits, and is expected to be driven in the future by greater use of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures
in Europe, the U.S. and Latin America, where we perceive significant potential for further growth.
During the years, we expanded our presence in the wine closures market through a series of
acquisitions, including Global Cap in 2003, Auscap in Australia in 2007, 70% of DGS in Poland in 2011,
MCG in South Africa in 2012 and 70% of CapMetal SAS (since renamed Guala Closures France SAS) in
France in 2016. In 2015, we commenced production operations in Chile, bolstered with our acquisition in
2017 of the screw cap activities of ICSA in Chile. More recently, in February 2020, we expanded our
production of wine closures in Europe through the acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH, a German
manufacturer specialising in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral
water. We believe that we are the leading producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures, with
approximately 30% market share by volume of units sold in 2019.

_Spirits_

We are a renowned key partner in the spirits markets. Through technological innovation, we offer
spirits makers solutions that increasingly prevent counterfeiting while meeting their needs for
premiumization and differentiation.

143


-----

In the spirits end-market, we primarily sell safety, luxury and roll-on aluminum closures to some of the
most prestigious multinational producers of spirits (such as Bacardi, Brown Forman, Campari, Diageo and
Pernod Ricard). We also sell our products to a number of important regional producers in many of the
countries in which we operate (such as state distilleries in Colombia, large whisky producers in India, and
vodka producers in Russia).

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the spirits end-market
represented 61.0% of our net revenue for the period.

_Wine_

With screw-on aluminum closures, wine is more stable over time and its balance is not compromised
during transport. Our caps are designed to facilitate opening and closing the bottle and feature liners that
limit the oxygenation of the wine so the wine retains its quality and flavour for a longer period of time.

In the wine end-market, we primarily sell roll-on aluminum closures to wine producers. The principal
customers of our wine closures are major wine producers (such as Accolade, Castel, Caviro and Torres,
Concha y Toro, Constellations Brands, Pernod Ricard and Treasury wines) as well as a number of
important regional players (such as Casella in New Zealand, Distell in South Africa and The Wine Group
in the United States).

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the wine end-market
represented 20.8% of our net revenue for the period.

_Water and beverages_

We produce aluminum closures for carbonated and still beverages in glass bottles, fruit juice and
non-alcoholic beverages. We supply some of the top international brands with generic closures or tamperevident closures that feature capsules based on a patented system to show when a bottle has been opened.

In the water and beverages end-market, we primarily sell roll-on aluminum closures to producers of
mineral water, such as Ferrarelle, Nestlé Waters and San Benedetto.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the water and beverages
end-market represented 10.6% of our net revenue for the period.

_Olive oil and condiments_

We offer the oil sector a varied range of long and short capsules, spouts specifically designed for the
viscosity of oil, and non-drip devices to prevent dripping at the end of the pour.

In the oil and condiments end-market, we primarily sell roll-on aluminum closures to producers of
olive oil, such as Carapelli, Deoleo, Unilever and Farchioni group, and vinegar, such as the Ponti group.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the olive oil and condiments
end-market represented 2.5% of our net revenue for the period.

_Other markets_

We also sell our products to customers in a broad range of other end-markets, including the
pharmaceutical market for PET products.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in other end-market represented
5.1% of our net revenue for the period.

We have had relationships with many of our customers for over 30 years. Our top five closures
customers the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 were (in alphabetical order) Bacardi, Casa Cuervo,
Diageo-USL, Pernod Ricard and Vinventions Deutschland. Together, they represented approximately
30.4% of our net revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Certain of our customers own
multiple brands. However, no single brand represented more than 3% of our 2020 net revenue as we
provide products to multiple brands of several global manufacturers.

Our customers spread across a wide range of geographies. The table below illustrates the geographic

Purchasing decisions by our major clients are rarely centralized and are usually made by managers
responsible for a single product or brand. With our major customers we enter into a general framework
agreement which governs dealings between the parties. Such arrangements generally specify the closure
models required, volumes and procedures for determining the purchase price during the term of the
contract. Usually a schedule of expected delivery quantities and dates is supplied at regular intervals which
enables us to co-ordinate our procurement of raw materials. In order to confirm a particular delivery date
and quantity, the customer sends us a purchase order containing the relevant information.

**Competition**

We are active in the design and production of safety, luxury and roll-on closures for spirits, wine,
water and beverages, olive oil and other products on a worldwide basis.

The broad selection of our closures and our significant diversification means that we face competition
from different global and local competitors, which we believe are made up as follows:

   - non-specialized main competitors, who produce spirits and wine closures on a global scale, without
particular specialization in any product;

   - specialized main competitors, or medium-sized competitors highly specialized, among others, in
spirits or wine closures;

   - non-specialized competitors, who produce packaging on a global scale, with limited market share
for spirits and wine closures; and

   - small, local manufacturers.

Our competitive advantages compared to other peers in the closures market include:

   - our ability to satisfy our customers’ requests, particularly in the spirits market where customers tend
to use one manufacturer per product;

   - our ability to meet specific requests from the market, especially in the safety and luxury market; and

   - pricing, in particular in the markets of roll-on closures and wine closures.

145


-----

We believe that, as of December 31, 2019, we held a global market share by volume of the safety
closures manufactured for spirits of more than 60%. We estimate that in 2020, our market shares for
Safety and Roll-on for wine closures was six and four times greater than that of our nearest competitor,
respectively.

**Research and development and Innovation**

We believe that continuous product innovation is key to our success. The main focus of our research
and development activities is on the development and delivery of products that address the quality
requirements and design preferences of our customers, by identifying and implementing technical
solutions that are more likely to result in innovative and sustainable products, which in turn we expect will
boost demand for our products. We also concentrate on standardizing functional components and on
developing processes that reduce our operating costs.

We currently operate five research and development centers, consisting of our main center, located in
in Spinetta Marengo (Alessandria), Italy, as well as four additional centers located in Luxembourg (Foetz),
Mexico (San José Iturbide), Ukraine (Sumy) and the United Kingdom (Kirkintilloch). These centres work
in collaboration with all of our department and plants. Our research and development center in Italy
comprises workshops and dedicated laboratories, collaborates on a regular basis with specialized external
research centers, such as universities and private laboratories, and coordinates the operations of our other
research centers in Scotland, Mexico, Ukraine and Luxembourg. Our research and development structure
consists of engineers, product and mold designers, and product and project managers. As of December 31,
2020, our research and development centers employed a staff of 51 people.

Our research and development team continuously seeks to identify new market trends and translate
them into smart, sustainable and valuable solutions. Our traditional market is undergoing a period of
profound change with customers looking for cost reductions and pushing some brands to the premium
level while looking for higher value packaging. Demand for customized, highly technological and
sustainable solutions is increasing from both large and established luxury brands and smaller producers,
who typically have tighter budgets. In addition, new generations are shifting consumption of alcoholic
beverages to craft products, which need to convey their origin in package messaging, as well as wellness
and ethical products.

Among our most recent innovations, we offer a wide range of e-closures that enable consumers to
confirm the authenticity of products and receive other product information through direct engagement
with sellers of products. In particular, we developed e-closures with fully integrated NFC capacity, allowing
the end customer to connect with the relevant brand and track and trace their products in connection with
combatting possible counterfeiting and product tampering. In the spring of 2017, in partnership with NXP
Semiconductors, we presented the industry’s first fully integrated NFC tamper-evident closure solution for
the wine and spirits industry, part of our new “Internet-of-Closures” smart family products. In addition,
starting from 2018, we developed a new series of e-closures with NFC capabilities under the brand
NeˇSTGATE[™]. This technology has revolutionized conventional bottle packaging by integrating
connectivity features into bottle closures for spirits, wine, olive oil and beverages. In particular, these
e-closures are equipped with a special microchip inside the capsule that is readable by all compatible
smartphones, without downloading any specific application, providing consumers with the certification of
authenticity and unlocking all information about the product, directly linking them to the brand, thus

146

boosting loyalty. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures include the first wine bottles with e-closures equipped with
NFC technology in Europe, which we launched in 2020 together with Vigneti Massa, a well-established
winemaker located in the Tortonesi Hills in Piedmont, Italy. We developed this e-closure in collaboration
with Compellio, a Luxembourg-based software company. End-customers can take advantage of the
technology embedded in these e-closures by creating their own virtual cellar hosted on Compellio’s online
platform and receive information on the wine growing areas, the vineyards, the vine, the tasting notes and
expert reviews. Customers can also verify the certification of the authenticity of the product using
blockchain technology that unequivocally identifies each bottle. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] closures are connected
to a blockchain platform which provides a unique identification code for each bottle. This allows Vigneti
Massa to protect sensitive product data and monitor them in real time, providing effective support for the
traceability of bottles along the supply chain. In 2020, we also launched new NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures for
Irish whiskey Jameson. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] product range also comprises various QR code-based as well as
more basic serial number-based models for wine and beverages. Most recently, we designed an electronic
tamper-evident closure equipped with proximity sensors capable of detecting nearby objects in partnership
with NXP Semiconductors, which we plan to launch in the coming months.

In order to refresh our current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized
products, our research and development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for
individual brands and equipped with innovative technological and sustainable solutions and with a
sophisticated design, which we expect to launch between 2021 and 2023.

The laboratory analysis and design of a new model usually takes between four and seven months. The
time required for industrialization and production is on average between six and 18 months, depending to
a large extent on the technical complexity of the particular product. During the last three years, we have
launched over 35 new products. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the costs for research and
development activities amounted to €3.1 million, of which €0.7 million was capitalized during the year.

**Environmental, Social and Governance and Sustainability**

Over the last decade, we have established a strong focus on Environmental, Social and Governance
(“ESG”) and sustainability trends in our key end-markets. This is supported by our sustainable
manufacturing process focused on protecting the environment, while not compromising the high quality of
our products. Our ESG strategy is based on three key pillars, the planet, our people and our business, and
comprises a series of key performance indicators and targets that we intend to achieve.

To ensure the effective implementation of our sustainability strategy and monitor our ongoing
progress, in 2015 we set up our “Green Board”, chaired by our Chief Operating Officer and composed of
twelve managers, of which eight corporate department heads and four country managers from different
geographical areas and continents. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, 2021, 50% of the
members of our Green Board were women.

Our sustainability team (which is different from our “Green Board”) is responsible for the
implementation and sharing of sustainability reporting at the Group level, the coordination of the activities
for the certification of environmental data and the review of the non-financial statement data carried out
by third-party companies as well as the implementation of inputs from the Green Board meetings. We also
have dedicated sustainability teams in each country and CSR managers at each business unit.

**_Planet_**

We strive to safeguard the environment by reducing the impact of our operations and wider value
chain. To achieve such result, we adopted a rigorous environmental policy across all of our facilities
focused primarily on (i) research, development and improvement of our products and production
processes based on products’ life cycles; (ii) engagement of all our stakeholders, particularly across our
supply chain, to meet sustainability objectives; and (iii) implementation of specific and measurable actions
for the protection of the environment.

Based on our environmental policy, we developed a comprehensive strategy to optimize sustainability
across our operations and we identified a series of sustainability targets that we intend to achieve. Among
our key objectives, we intend to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished
product from our baseline in 2016 by optimizing processes and investing in new equipment for plants as
well as optimizing loads and logistics across our supply chain. In addition, we intend to further reduce our
energy consumption per ton of finished products. Other key sustainability targets include the reduction of

147


-----

total waste per ton of finished products and of hazardous waste and waste sent to landfill, the reduction of
water withdrawal per ton of finished products by 28%, which we have already achieved in 2020, and obtain
of the ISO 14001 certification on environmental management for all our facilities. We also intend to
increase the overall share of all recycled materials (including both aluminum and plastics) used in our
packaging products, which was 27% in 2020.

As part of our sustainability plan to increase the use of energy from renewable sources, we launched
dedicated programs at some of our plants. In 2020, our plants in Auckland, Sao Paulo, Magenta, Termoli
and Olerdola transitioned (fully or at least in part) to electricity produced from renewable sources. In
particular, our facility in New Zealand received a full year’s supply of electrical energy from renewable
sources in 2020. The Spanish facility in Olerdola began receiving electricity supply entirely from renewable
sources in January 2020. In addition, since 2018, the Brazilian facility in São Paulo has received an annual
supply of energy from renewable sources covering 100% of consumption. In 2020, we also signed an
agreement with an Italian energy supplier to cover the entire electricity consumption of our Magenta and
Termoli plants with the supply of electrical energy from renewable sources.

In order to make our production process more efficient, improve quality of our products, reduce
waste and increase energy and water savings, in the three months ended March 31, 2021, we implemented
Iris, a new software developed entirely in-house, at our Spinetta Marengo facility in Italy. This software,
which is able to connect 150 machines simultaneously, performs data analysis and makes recommendations
to the facility’s operator on how to improve product quality, reduce waste and increase energy and water
savings in line with our key sustainability principles. Going forward, we plan to implement the new
software at our Termoli and Magenta facilities in Italy, as well as at all of our other facilities worldwide.

The efficiency of production processes is key to achieving customer and investor satisfaction and we
intend to increase our Overall Equipment Effectiveness (“OEE”), the indicator that measures the total
efficiency of plants and equipment, which is calculated as the ratio of output and saturated input, and
highlights inefficiencies related to organization, maintenance, production and quality. Our OEE was
76.3% in 2020. We also aim to reduce our average production scrap rate.

**_People_**

The commitment to sustainability is an integral part to our corporate culture and lies at the core of
our relationship with our employees, customers, suppliers and the broader society in which we operate. We
strive to ensure a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees across all of our facilities
worldwide. With plants and offices in 25 countries and customers from over 100 countries, we place great
importance on diversity and inclusion as well as talent recruitment and management. In 2020, we adopted
a dedicated charter of diversity and inclusion, which we applied to all our plants, to ensure equal
opportunities and treatment, strengthen our multiculturalism and inclusiveness and to maintain and
bolster a sense of belonging. The percentage of women holding leadership positions (i.e., managers)
increased from 15.8% as of December 31, 2018 to 20.0% as of March 31, 2021. Following the appointment
of the new board of directors on April 30, 2021, 44% of the members of our board of directors are women.

We endeavor to safeguard the health and safety of our employees through our “zero accident”
strategy, which aims at reducing the frequency rates of work-related injuries. Our accident frequency rate
(number of incidents per million hours worked) has been decreasing consistently over time and in 2020, we
recorded 63 incidents, compared to 88 in 2019, with a decrease in the frequency rate of 22.8%, from 7.71 to
5.95. The rate of accident severity (days of absence per incident per thousand hours worked) also
decreased by approximately 40% from 0.30 to 0.18 from 2019 to 2020.

Overall, we place a great importance on our corporate social responsibility and our public image and
endeavor to apply the highest ethical and legal standards when shaping our strategic goals and in our daily
business activities. We strive to incorporate ethical and social responsibility principles in our internal
guidelines and procedures. In addition, we give our employees extensive opportunities to develop their
skills and talents and offer various training courses on their work and job security and we promote the
environmental awareness of the people who work for us through training courses.

In addition, we work to support the countries in which we operate and seek to give back to local
communities through impactful community projects to support the developing countries in which we
operate (including India, Colombia and Mexico), including through various reforestation projects to offset
our Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions which we started in 2011. We also offset carbon dioxide through
reforestation projects in collaboration with international NGOs and the purchase of carbon credits (i.e.,

148


-----

certificates equivalent to one ton of CO2 per certificate, not emitted or absorbed as the result of an
environmental protection project aimed at reducing or reabsorbing global emissions of CO2 and other
greenhouse gases). We developed these projects with influential partners and independent international
certified agencies that audited our activities. By the end of 2020, we have planted over 390,000 trees and
involved more than 6,500 people in the various projects across the developing countries in which we
operate.

Examples of other projects to support local communities in the countries in which we operate, include
the distribution of “dignity kits”, which include sanitary towels, undergarments and training on menstrual
education to teenage girls across Kenya, and the development and sponsorship of environmental education
to thousands of students in India.

**_Business_**

Sustainability and zero-environmental impact packages are becoming increasingly important. Our
products and customers are the top priorities of our ESG and sustainability strategy, and this is reflected in
our focus on product innovation and design.

In order to provide a range of harmonized sustainable packaging solutions, we have developed
specific guidelines for eco-design which we have adopted at our five research and development centers in
September 2020. Our eco-design guidelines are based on four defined design templates: (i) design to
_reduce, based on reducing raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products, which decreases the_
overall impact of our operations on the environment; (ii) design to change, based on increasing the use of
recycled materials in our products, including aluminum and certain types of polymers as well as wood;
(iii) design to fade, focused on eliminating waste by using biodegradable polymers; and (iv) design to revive,
based on recycling our end-products to reduce scrap pollution and waste.

In line with our long-term commitment to design sustainable solutions, in November 2020, we
launched a new range of sustainable products under the umbrella brand Blossom[™], which includes
products such as Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap made of recycled
materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and agglomerated cork that
we developed in collaboration with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials,
and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from
completely bio-based polymers.

Our research and development team focuses on the studying and prototyping closures made of
materials and technical solutions that reduce the environmental impact of packaging over its life cycle,
including recycled polymers, biopolymers and composite polymers. To achieve such result, we study and
analyze the various phases of a product’s life, from the production of selected raw materials to end-of-life
treatment, by using tools developed by us together with selected partners. In 2020, we signed contracts with
new suppliers of recycled polymers and carried out plastic moulding tests, especially for the production of
PET bottles, one of the few plastic materials that has a specific recycling chain. In December 2020, we
signed an exclusivity agreement with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable
materials, in order to develop a line of T-bar closures manufactured using fully recycled ocean-diverted
plastic.

Customer satisfaction is a key element of our corporate culture and we strive to provide punctual,
effective and high quality customer service. We measure our customer service level by monitoring the “On
Time and In Full” or “OTIF” indicator, which considers the percentage of deliveries made on time and in
full compared to the total number of shipments made. In 2020, our OTIF reached 89.8% despite the
COVID-19 pandemic. We leverage our network of plants to ensure continuity of service to customers,
reducing the risk of service disruptions as well as interruptions in the supply of utilities and malfunctions.
We also agreed continuity plans with our major customers that include production in alternative plants or
the identification of backup warehouses.

In addition, we launched projects to reduce the environmental impact of product packaging across
several plants (including in Italy, France, Ukraine and Scotland) in order to both replace cardboard boxes
with reusable plastic packaging (in collaboration with some important customers) and replace disposable
wooden pallets with reusable recycled plastic pallets.

**Intellectual property**

We rely on a combination of patents, utility models, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights, non-disclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our

149


-----

proprietary rights. We strongly believe in the importance of intellectual property rights, which in our view
is one of the key elements of our current business. We employ various methods, including confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets
and know-how. As of March 31, 2021, we held, or had lodged applications for, more than 170 patents,
including 113 active patent families, 10 utility model families, 5 combined patents and utility model
families and 44 protected industrial designs. The patents and other IP have been registered predominantly
in countries in which our production facilities are located, or in countries in which our major customers are
based.

We have been active in the production of safety closures since the 1970s when we launched the
famous 1031 model safety closure. Most of our older patents related to the creation of innovative solutions
for tamper-evident and tamper proofing features in closures with these features being implemented
alongside new designs of plastic components and the interaction of plastic components with aluminum
shells. Our more recent patent applications take advantage of new technologies in an innovative manner
and for the first time in the closures field, include production cost savings and sustainable methods (for
waste reduction) as well as improvements in the efficiency of tamper-evident and anti-counterfeiting
measures.

**Marketing and sales**

We reach our customer base primarily through our direct sales force. Our sales force is organized
geographically and is able to focus on target markets and customers by understanding local needs. In
certain markets, we enter into agency agreements with independent sales agents or use distributors in
order to benefit from established local sales channels or because market conditions demand their use.

We tailor our marketing activities primarily on the basis of our current level of penetration in a
specific market. Our marketing strategy involves publication of advertisements in sector paid media
(online and paper-based), participation in specialized conferences and use of digital marketing tools,
public relations and communication agencies and ad hoc sponsorships. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, we have intensified our marketing activities via webinars and virtual conferences and we expect
this trend to continue in the future.

Participation at annual trade fairs for packaging, spirits, wine and water and beverage industries is
another important means of keeping in contact with customers, particularly in the earlier stages of our
entrance into a market when we have lower brand awareness and limited access to the market, for
example, when we originally entered South East Asia (in Japan and Bangkok), Africa (in Nigeria and
Kenya), and the United States.

**Raw materials and suppliers**

We purchase aluminum in coil and aluminum foil from a number of suppliers which we select based
on technical criteria, service quality, reliability and sustainability parameters. Our principal suppliers of
aluminum are located in Europe and most of the aluminum we used is produced by the Magenta facility
and then allocated to our facilities worldwide. However, our plants in Poland, Ukraine, South Africa,
Argentina and Australia purchase part of the aluminum they use from third-party suppliers. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, we used a total of 35,481 tons of aluminum.

Our aluminum purchase agreements specify quality and performance levels, technical specifications of
the product, price breakdowns, total processing costs, delivery plans and payment schedules and minimum
purchase quantities for annual consumption. We also purchase aluminum ingots on the spot market, which
we then dispatch for processing to suppliers of aluminum coil. In addition, we meet part of our demand of
aluminum through a transformation process of aluminum stemming from production waste.

In addition, we use more than 43,000 tons per year of different types of plastics. The majority of our
purchases of plastic resins are made on the basis of purchase orders from a number of leading European
and world producers. While we have a central control of plastic purchase price, raw materials are primarily
sourced locally. Our key plastic resins suppliers for our European production facilities are located in Italy,
France, Germany and Belgium. The majority of the plastics resins used in production are low and highdensity polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and polycarbonate. Our supply requirements contracts
with our principal suppliers set out the terms of payment, delivery schedules and the criteria for
determining any price and volume discounts (usually conditional upon us meeting specified purchase
targets). Our supply contracts also provide for adjustments of prices depending on periodic increases or

150


-----

decreases in plastic resins prices, which, in turn, change on a weekly basis, except in the case of
polycarbonate, the price of which is generally set for periods of several months.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, the share of recycled raw materials used in our products was
27% compared to 23% in 2018, and we intend to increase it to 35% by the end of 2025.

Raw materials prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Increases in the
prices of our raw materials have therefore had a direct impact on our production costs. We are able to
manage this by reducing the quantity of aluminum used in our manufacturing process and substituting it
with other raw materials.

Since most of our closures division sales are made on the basis of contracts that fix our sales prices for
the term of each contract (generally one year) or are otherwise made pursuant to purchase orders that do
not link sales prices to increases in the cost of raw materials, our closures division margins are exposed to
the risk of fluctuations of the prices of raw materials. In order to mitigate our exposure to such risks, we
select our suppliers very carefully. We also continually seek to implement innovative product and process
solutions aimed at reducing consumption of raw materials. Additionally, in respect of aluminum, we use
hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. We typically purchase aluminum based
on contracts that set prices by reference to the aluminum quotations on the London Metal Exchange in
euro or U.S. dollars, which are converted into euro at the average exchange rate at the month of purchase.

We seek to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with aluminum price fluctuations by entering
into forward contracts with brokers operating on the London Metal Exchange, whereby we purchase
aluminum at a fixed price to protect our operating margins from price volatility. Our forward hedging
transactions covered approximately 60% of our aluminum supplies at December 31, 2020. Our forward
hedging transactions currently cover approximately 70% of our estimated 2021 aluminum needs. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Principal factors
_affecting our results of operations—Costs for raw materials”. To date we have not entered into similar_
hedging arrangements in respect of plastic price fluctuations, because such arrangements are not currently
available in the market.

**Manufacturing process**

The production process for safety closures and for aluminum shells is divided into three stages:
(i) injection molding of plastic components and for aluminum shell production, (ii) customization and
(iii) assembly. We first produce each plastic component by using injection molding technology developed
by our in-house personnel. Our closures are then customized by applying surface decoration through
various techniques, such as off-set, silk screen or tomographic printing, or hot-stamping. Finally, we
assemble the plastic safety closure itself and are able to assemble multiple components at high speed. As
part of our continuous effort to make our manufacturing process more efficient by leveraging
technological innovations, we are implementing a multi-injection project to develop closures made of
different plastics in the same mould in order to eliminate the assembly stage of our manufacturing process
and provide significant additional anti-counterfeiting protection to our closures. In addition, we focus on
wide-scale flexible automation of our productions process, which we plan to implement also for small and
medium-sized product batches.

The luxury product line uses the same processing techniques as our safety closures product line, but
extra attention is paid to aesthetic design. The process may involve “metallization” of the capsule or
applying other special finishes, depending on the characteristics of the end-product. The production
process of roll-on aluminum closures and screwcaps for wine closures begins with the aluminum coil being
washed and cleaned. The sheets are printed and pressed into different shells and aluminum rings. If a
customer wishes to have a more aesthetically appealing design or to customize the closure with a particular
color or with the company’s trademark, we perform side-printing using off-set and silk-screen techniques.
The final stage of the production process is the assembly of the aluminum closure where we insert seals or
plastic components such as non-drip spouts or flow inhibitors. Some pharmaceutical closures use rubber
which is cut to the correct shape then washed and sterilized.

We have warehouses adjacent to almost all the production facilities. Our plastic materials are kept in
dedicated silos to avoid jeopardizing the purity of our end-products. Since our finished products are
generally shipped directly to customers soon after production, they are stored only for limited periods of
time.

**Quality control and certifications**

As of March 31, 2021, most of our closures division production facilities have been ISO 9001:2015
certified, which requires compliance with a set of shipping, trading and technology standards promulgated
by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”). In addition, as of March 31, 2021, the
majority of our production facilities obtained the ISO 22000:2018 certification for food safety management
systems and the 14001 certification for environmental management systems. We intend to obtain these
certifications for all of our plants by the end of 2022.

In order to offer objective guarantees of compliance with occupational, health and safety,
environmental and ethics standards, we have joined the SEDEX (social ethical data exchange) platform
with the aim of keeping information on all plants updated, making it transparent to customers and having
our plants subject to SMETA audits by third parties. As of March 31, 2021, all of our plants were included
in the platform, and in 2020 SMETA audits were carried out at four of our plants, the relevant audit
reports were made available to our customers and we are implementing any necessary measures in light of
their findings and recommendations.

All of our facilities utilize efficient quality control and certification processes for raw materials. We
perform regular quality controls on the raw materials that are supplied to us by our suppliers. Our
technical staff checks the technical characteristics, including the purity and quality of polymers, their
resistance to pressure and shock, their conformity with EU regulations governing packaging materials for
food, and their resistance to the effects of alcohol. Moreover, plastics are also tested to ensure that they do
not affect the taste of spirits.

We operate an advanced quality assurance process to improve the quality performance of all our
facilities. Qualified staff at each production facility carry out tests on raw materials, processes and
end-products to improve quality and adopt corrective or preventive measures to ensure a high level of
efficiency throughout our production chain. These processes include the use of statistical process control
and we involve our employees in on-going monitoring activities. We believe that this approach to quality
control increases employee participation and provides necessary training at all levels. The staff assigned to
this task have an active role in the development and modernization of our production facilities. We
monitor the quality of our finished products to ensure that our products fully meet our customers’
requirements and expectations. We believe that our quality assurance practices are critical to improving
our internal processes and the service we provide to our customers.

In addition to our internal quality control operations, we offer our customers the opportunity to send
their personnel to our closures division facilities periodically to verify the quality of our products and the
production process. Those of our facilities that manufacture products for the mineral water market also
meet stringent requirements regarding facility hygiene.

As of December 31, 2020, 36.4% of our employees was covered by collective bargaining agreements
and 19.7% was covered by company-level agreements.

**Production facilities**

We believe that all of our plants are well-maintained, in good operating condition and strategically
located. As of March 31, 2021, we operated 30 production facilities around the world. This wide
distribution of production activity reflects our strategy to operate in close proximity to our clients’
production facilities, which we believe enables us to reduce transport and shipping costs and to be flexible
in meeting our customers’ demands.

Our production facilities were designed with the aim of ensuring safe assembly and high production
speed. The assembly of the machinery used in production facilities is performed for safety closures at our
headquarters in Alessandria, Italy. We perform maintenance and modernization work at the relevant
production facilities.

The maintenance of our facilities is undertaken, both in Italy and abroad, by a team of specialized
technicians. They are responsible for ordinary and extraordinary maintenance operations and also carry
out modernization activities which normally occurs every two or three years.

**Committees**

In accordance with the Issuer’s By-Laws, on April 30, 2021, the Board of Directors has resolved, inter
_alia, to establish a Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee and a Remuneration and Nomination_
Committee.

Following completion of Sell-Out and Squeeze-Out procedures, Guala’s ordinary shares and Market
Warrants will be delisted from the Mercato Telematico Azionario organized and managed by Borsa Italiana
S.p.A. and Guala will cease to be a publicly listed Company. As a result, the Issuer expects that the
governance structure currently in place and described below will be simplified. See “Summary—The
_Transactions”._

**_Control, Risks and Sustainability Committee_**

The Control, Risks and Sustainability Committee was established on April 30, 2021 and, as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum, Marina Brogi (President), Chiara Palmieri (independent director) and
Raffaella Viscardi (independent director) are the members of the this committee.

The Control, Risks and Sustainability Committee is in charge of assisting the Board of Directors in
connection with internal control and risk management of the Issuer. The Control, Risks and Sustainability
Committee also serves as the “related parties committee” under the related parties policy approved by the
Board of Directors and adopted by the Issuer in accordance with CONSOB guidelines (the “Related
**Parties Policy”). In this role, it expresses opinions on the approval of and amendments to the Related**
Parties Policy, expresses opinions on certain transactions deemed to be between related parties,
participates in the negotiation of related party transactions deemed to be of greater importance and
provides assistance in connection with the identification of related parties.

The new sustainability role of this committee was identified in accordance with the Shareholder
Rights Directive II of the European Union, which is aimed, among other things, at strengthening the role
of finance in the transition to a sustainable economy, managing financial risks associated with ESG aspects
more effectively and encouraging a long-term investment approach. The specific functions and duties of
the Control, Risks and Sustainability Committee with regard to sustainability will be defined by the Board
of Directors.

**_Remuneration and Nomination Committee_**

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee was formed on April 30, 2021 and, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, Chiara Palmieri (President), Marina Brogi (independent director) and Dante
Razzano (director) are the members of the Remuneration Committee.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee pays an advisory and consulting role in the
remuneration and appointment of directors and key executives. The creation of the Remuneration and
Nomination Committee facilitates maximum information and transparency regarding the compensation
due to the CEO and other top management. However, pursuant to article 2389(3) of the Italian Civil Code
and article 15 of the Issuer’s By-Laws, the Remuneration and Nomination Committee only offers advice
and recommendation, as the power to determine compensation remains with the Board of Directors, with
advice from the Board of the Statutory Auditors.

**Compliance Program Supervisory Board ex D. Lgs. 231/2001**

On April 30, 2020, the Board of Directors appointed Roberta Barristin (President) and Ascensionato
Carnà as members of the Compliance Program Supervisory Board, adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree

with the organizational and management model adopted in compliance with Legislative Decree 231/2001.

and conditions of the warrants. In particular, pursuant to the respective regulations: (i) the Market

(ii) the sponsor warrants and the management warrants become exercisable when the ordinary shares
reach an official price (recorded on at least one trading day on the Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements. The
following summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such
arrangements.

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Transactions, prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer shall enter into a super senior
revolving credit facility agreement with, among others, U.S. Bank Global Corporate Trust Limited, as the

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a super senior revolving credit facility in a principal
amount of €80.0 million.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer and certain of its restricted subsidiaries
which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers of that facility (the
“SSRCF Borrowers”) and may be applied in or towards (directly or indirectly) (x) financing or refinancing
the working capital requirements and/or the general corporate purposes of the Group and (x) any other
purpose contemplated by the funds flow statement or the tax structure memorandum in connection with
the Transactions.

The Revolving Credit Facility will be available in euros, sterling and U.S. dollars and certain other
currencies readily available in the relevant interbank market by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of
letters of credit and ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis).

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the date of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, provided that the Notes have been issued, to (and including) the date which is one
(1) month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR for loans denominated in euro, a rate based on, SONIA for loans denominated in sterling, or
for loans denominated other than in euro or sterling, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which in each
case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Debt as at the last day of the relevant period to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA in respect of that
relevant period (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio”). In addition, the margin for the Revolving Credit Facility may reduce further whilst a
Suspension Event is continuing.

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
the Revolving Credit Facility. If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of
loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility. If SONIA is less than zero, SONIA shall be deemed to be
zero in respect of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility from the Closing Date (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
the “Closing Date”) to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility at a
rate of thirty (30)% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be
payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date
on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest

163


-----

Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling seventy eight (78) months from the Issue Date.
Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed,
subject to certain conditions.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de minimis
amounts). The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory
prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a “Change of Control” within time periods set out in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the Revolving Credit Facility is defined as per the Notes,
save that, in addition, on and from the date that SPSI is the 100% shareholder of the Issuer, it shall also
constitute a “Change of Control” under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement if persons providing third
party security for the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement cease to directly own
100% of shares in the Issuer.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will be initially guaranteed by the Issuer.

The Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the Collateral that also secures the Notes as set forth
under “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides that
material subsidiaries (wholly owned members of the Group whose earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same bases as Consolidated EBITDA) represent more
than five (5) per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA) (the “Material Subsidiaries”) which are not incorporated
in certain excluded jurisdictions will subject to the terms of the Agreed Security Principles set out therein
(the “Agreed Security Principles”) guarantee the Facilities and, provide security over (x) shares owned by
such Material Subsidiaries in other Material Subsidiaries and (y) material, structural, long term,
documented recievables owed to such person by any other Material Subsidiary not incorporated in an
excluded jurisdiction.

Subject to certain adjustments and the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer is required to ensure
that members of the Group that (x) are Material Subsidiaries which are not incorporated in certain
excluded jurisdictions and/or (y) collectively contribute in aggregate at least eighty (80) per cent. of
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and subject to certain
adjustments as set out therein) are guarantors of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (i) 180 days
after the Closing Date and (ii) thereafter within 180 days of the latest due date when the annual financial
statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered to the agent in connection with the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject
to certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
requirements of applicable law and the other matters set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
(and, to the extent such requirement is not satisfied on such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so
satisfied within 180 days of such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to
certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including, among others,

drawings) and at certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Indenture.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain

164

exceptions and grace periods, including covenants relating to (i) authorizations, (ii) compliance with laws;
(iii) centre of main interests; (iv) provision of guarantees and security (v) compliance with sanctions, antimoney laundering and anti- corruption laws, (vi) further assurance and (vii) conditions subsequent.

default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) inaccuracy of a
representation or statement when made, (ii) unlawfulness and invalidity of the Revolving Credit Facility
financing documents (including the applicable security documents), (iii) material failure to comply with the
Intercreditor Agreement and (iv) repudiation or rescission of the Revolving Credit Facility financing
documents (including the applicable security documents).

**_Governing Law_**

connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with
English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related

New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by
English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, on or
prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer shall into an Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent,
arrangers and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Trustee and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms
and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of
existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super
Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Unsecured Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The
conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the
terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange,
set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing
arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New
Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other
person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security
Document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, promptly

169


-----

amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or promptly release any asset from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to effect the
ranking, priority guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject to certain conditions,
including as regards the terms of such new security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by the
Issuer), substantially the same as the terms of the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security). Any release and re-grant of Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security may only be undertaken if (i) (A) required under the New Debt Financing;
(B) necessary under applicable law to give effect to the ranking as described under “—Priority of Security”
above; or (C) the Issuer has determined in good faith that it is either not possible or not desirable to
implement the New Debt Financing on terms satisfactory to the Issuer by instead granting additional
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or amending
the terms of the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may
be); and (ii) if any asset is to be released from Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security (as the case may be), promptly upon giving effect to that release, replacement Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) is, subject to certain conditions,
granted in favor of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the providers and/or agents and/or trustees of
the New Debt Financing and (in relation to the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security (as the case may be)) the existing Secured Parties (or relevant class thereof) or Topco Creditors
(as the case may be) benefitting from the Security on substantially the same terms as the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) released (except that it shall also
secure any New Debt Financing). Each Secured Party agrees (i) not to take any action to challenge the
validity or enforceability of additional Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking; (ii) that additional Transaction
Security may be granted by any Debtor to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities and/or New
Debt Financing and (iii) the Additional Topco Independent Transaction Security may be granted by any
Topco Independent Obligor to secure all or any part of any New Debt Financing.

Any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of a New Debt Financing
or in respect of any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited by the
terms of the Finance Documents and which is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a
person or any of its subsidiaries who becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date or (ii) a
person that merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing
Date, or (iii) the assets of or shares in any person listed in paragraphs (i) or (ii) above or otherwise
acquired after the Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), shall be permitted to subsist (or
to be granted in accordance with the applicable terms) and there is no requirement to offer that security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document.

No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any
member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any
Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or
is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles, (ii) over any asset required
(including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the
benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation in relation to such Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not
including an obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

Liabilities and the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities (together, the “Senior Liabilities”), the Super Senior

upon illegality or in relation to any other provisions that permits the prepayment of a single
lender without a related requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors, and (N) if no Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and
the payment is of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity
date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that
contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first
issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority
Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below) give prior consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party
Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the
Topco Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one Business
Day after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as
defined below)) issues a notice (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any debt facilities
advanced to Topco (each a “Topco Facility”) (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes
(the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the
Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors
(each as defined below) gave the instructions to deliver the relevant stop notice) delivers a notice
to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the payment
stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular
Senior Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served
(i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco
Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

-----

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the second lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the
applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or (in respect
of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) to Topco or any party that has acceded to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco Investor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement, the
“Topco Investors”) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Topco
Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would
have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the first date (the “Topco Discharge Date”) on which all of the Topco Liabilities have
been fully discharged (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor)
receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either
(x) not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) other than where the set-off provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement apply, any amount by way
of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above and other than where the set-off provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement apply, any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any
Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as
defined below)); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; and in the case of IntraGroup Liabilities, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the relevant
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or
recovered notwithstanding that an acceleration event is continuing);

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

174


-----

(v) (other than in respect of the provisions set out under “New Debt Financing” above or where the
set-off provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement apply) any distribution in cash or in kind or
payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any Debtor, any
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result
of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that Debtor,
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to
the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Obligor, any member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of
security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the
enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” except in accordance with such provisions.

The relationship of the Security Agent to the Creditors is construed to be as one of principal and
agent in relation to any jurisdiction the courts of which would not recognize or give effect to the trust
expressed to be created by this turnover mechanism.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any
resolution or making of an order for its insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or
reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its
indebtedness, (c) the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, examiner, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any
analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious
proceedings (which, if capable of remedy, are discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20 Business Days of
commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised), any proceedings or appointments which
the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or will be unsuccessful or as permitted under any
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted
Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not
constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured
Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person
responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to
the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s
liabilities to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise
and in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall
pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the

175


-----

Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of
Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each
creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement), member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors
agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of
an Instructing Group or otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50%
of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior
Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super
Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to
enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in
accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction
_Security” below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of
the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise
in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become
enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to
issue enforcement instructions, they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement
Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement
they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or
if the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an
Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the
request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super
Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a
determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the
Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the
expected realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the
Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the

176


-----

Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they
(A) have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce (or to cease enforcing) the Transaction Security, or
(B) have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (where the rights of the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce have
arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement), or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors
(as applicable) have not given instructions or they (A) have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce
(or to cease enforcing) the Transaction Security, or (B) have not required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Topco Creditors (where the rights of the
Majority Topco Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such
instructions and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including
that (i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of
enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must
be received in cash and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by
way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is request to do so by
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion
from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance
with its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or
refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in
accordance with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as
any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other
than the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the
paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for their relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

member of the Topco Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to

of any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security, and (2) any other transaction not prohibited by any Finance Document (or where
any applicable release and/ or consent has been obtained) pursuant to which that asset will

similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer must

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor or member of the Senior
Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor
or member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be a member
of Topco Group or a Debtor (including by way of resignation or being designated an Unrestricted
Subsidiary), to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal, transaction or
designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor
is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to
voluntarily prepay all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document and any right to decline, delay or
prevent any such prepayment in any Debt Document shall be disapplied (but without prejudice to any
prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other payment required by the relevant Finance
Documents).

In the case of a Debt Transfer (defined below), the Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights
and obligations of any Super Senior Borrower, Senior Borrower or Second Lien Borrower (each as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) (a “Borrower”) in respect of its liabilities (including borrowing liabilities)
under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Borrower (a
“Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either: (A) such Debt Transfer is to another member of the Senior
Secured Group; (B) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any holding company
of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of
such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s
borrowing liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents; or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in
connection with an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof); and (ii) the transferee in respect of such Debt Transfer is (in the case of a Super Senior
Borrower) another Super Senior Borrower, or (in the case of a Senior Borrower or Second Lien Borrower)
another Senior Borrower or (in the case of a Second Lien Borrower) another Second Lien Borrower. Any
Debt Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Company) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of
book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by
a member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or
shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the
request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable
as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an
acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a
result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which
is not a member of the Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(subject to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below and at the cost of the relevant
Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider
or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of
that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or
desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or

181


-----

other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that
Debtor over any of its assets and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted
by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets and
(C) any other claim of an intra- group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a
Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on
behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding
company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors under the Debt Documents or to any Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured
Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any
other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured
Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not
part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all
or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to
any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf
of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those
intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described in paragraph (iv) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities as described in
paragraph (iv) above has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities as described in paragraphs (iv) and
(v)above) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable
care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall
not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to
achieve a higher price) and shall in all cases comply with the provisions set out below.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are
entitled to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing
liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or

182


-----

guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case
of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility,
made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor) following that
release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing. guarantee or other liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second
Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities
would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to
have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer, in
which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer
and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to
execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the
consent of each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it
is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(vi) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(vii) such sale or disposal is made (A) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process
conducted with the advice of a reputable, independent or financially recognized investment bank
or firm of accountants (or (if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable, independent and
internationally recognized third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing
valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject to the relevant
Transaction Security) and, in each, case not being an auditor or administrator of the applicable
company (a “Financial Adviser”) as selected by the Security Agent, in respect of which the
Secured Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B) where a
Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Group) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with
such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(viii) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release,
transfer or disposal; or

(ix) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are
sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent permitted
by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and
Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their subsidiaries being sold and disposed of

discharged or sold or disposed of (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all
security under documents creating security in respect of the secured obligations in respect of
the assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is unconditionally released and

-----

discharged, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (1)
(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will
recover a greater cash amount if the Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or its affiliates and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate
amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities (which shall be deemed to be the case if
there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed
bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of Senior Secured
Liabilities) and (2) serves written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the
Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the
purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group) that
the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or
engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or
prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security
securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and
Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their subsidiaries being sold and disposed of (a
“Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold
or disposed of (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under
documents creating security in respect of the secured obligations in respect of the assets of
such members of the Senior Secured Group is unconditionally released and discharged,
provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and
trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith)
determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover a greater amount if the Relevant
Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and provided such
amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured
Liabilities (which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior
Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second
Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide
and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding
amount of the Priority Secured Liabilities), then the Security Agent shall be entitled
immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has

of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement
(it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any
Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in

184

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors
it represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such

authorized relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in
its capacity as such).

Document, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register
such Transaction Security Document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in
section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any
payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such amendment,

Independent Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed, the prior consent of (i) each of the
agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities,

adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other
creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
(only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Issuer,
will be required.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such

Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case
may be, Security Agent.

participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to provide any confirmation or
notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document (other than a
Notes Indenture) which does not contain a snooze/lose provision substantially equivalent to that described
in this paragraph or which contains a longer period, any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten
Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents
or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such
creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed
to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable. However, this provision shall not
apply to any noteholder in respect of a request where such noteholder is not given the option to respond to
such request in the negative but shall otherwise apply to all noteholders.

thereof) (an “IPO”) the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will

replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate the matters described in each of the above

188


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the
heading “—Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” the terms the “Issuer,”
“we,” “our” and “us” refer only to Guala Closures S.p.A., a società per azioni incorporated under the laws
of the Republic of Italy, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3 [1]⁄4% Senior Secured Notes
due 2028 (the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), between,
_inter alios, the Issuer, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as security agent and in its_
role as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) under the Indenture and representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to and for the purposes set forth under Article 2414_bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security Agent”), and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as_
paying agent and transfer agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include terms
of, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer to
redeem the Existing Notes and pay accrued interest thereon, to repay the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, for general corporate purposes and to pay fees
and expenses associated with the Transactions. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the
Issuer and will not be guaranteed by any member of the Group. Subject to and in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles and subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable law, the
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will be jointly and severally guaranteed, within 180
days from the Business Day falling immediately after the Issue Date, on a senior basis by either (a) Guala
Closures Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Australia Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Ibérica S.A.U.,
Guala Closures International B.V., Guala Closures U.K. Limited, Guala Closures México, S.A. de C.V.
and Guala Closures Servicios México, S.A. de C.V. or (b) such other combination of Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will have guaranteed the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as of such
date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—The Notes will not be initially
_guaranteed by the Guarantors or secured by the Collateral, and the granting of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Collateral is subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain other limitations.” Prior to the granting of_
the Notes Guarantees (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated
to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer, and after the
granting of the Notes Guarantees (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally
subordinated to any indebtedness or obligations of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors.

The Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection
requirements, by the Collateral (as defined herein) within the timeframes described herein. The Collateral
will also secure obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations
(if any). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), and subject to applicable
laws, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from
such Collateral only after the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to
certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. In addition, subject applicable laws, the Notes
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, and applicable laws, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to
certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_
See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—The Notes Guarantees of the
_Guarantors may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely_
_affect their validity and enforceability,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit_
_Facility Agreement” and “—Security.”_

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of
the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness,
turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received

by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a
description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes,
any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents. Since this description of the
terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture and the Transaction
Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and the Issuer and your
rights.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement
and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

   - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer’s obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (if any);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

   - rank effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not secured by
the Collateral to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer or of
subsidiaries of the Issuer that are secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other indebtedness or obligation;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of subsidiaries of
the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors;

   - be, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain material limitations pursuant to
applicable laws, guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Guarantors as described herein; and

   - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form but in certain circumstances may be
represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral only after certain obligations entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full, including obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations (if any).

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by any
of its subsidiaries. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and subject to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable law, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
will be jointly and severally guaranteed, within 180 days from the Business Day falling immediately after
the Issue Date, on a senior basis by either (a) Guala Closures Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, Guala Closures
Australia Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Ibérica S.A.U., Guala Closures International B.V., Guala Closures U.K.
Limited, Guala Closures México, S.A. de C.V. and Guala Closures Servicios México, S.A. de C.V. or
(b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will have guaranteed the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement as of such date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes
_Guarantees—The Notes will not be initially guaranteed by the Guarantors or secured by the Collateral, and the_
_granting of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral is subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain_
_other limitations.”_

Each Notes Guarantee will, upon issuance:

   - be a senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

193


-----

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantor that
is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, including the
Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging
obligations (if any);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated to its Notes Guarantee;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Guarantor
that is secured by property and assets that do not secure its Notes Guarantee to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such other indebtedness or obligation; and

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of subsidiaries of
the Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors and
settlement obligations.

The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, as described herein
and under “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” By virtue of these limitations, each Guarantor’s obligation_
under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—The Notes Guarantees of the Guarantors may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—The insolvency and administrative laws
_of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United_
_States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Notes Guarantees,_
_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” In addition,_
the Notes Guarantee may be released under certain circumstances. See “—The Notes Guarantees—Notes
_Guarantees Release.”_

The Guarantors will also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on
or prior to the date on which the Guarantors will provide their respective Notes Guarantees. Prior to the
granting of the Notes Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any
existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the
expected Guarantors until such time that such entities provide a Notes Guarantee).

Although the Issuer is an operating company, a significant amount of its revenue and EBITDA are
generated by, and a significant amount of its assets comprise, the contribution of its Subsidiaries for which
it acts as holding company, and the Issuer conducts its operations outside of Italy through its Subsidiaries.
A portion of the operations of the Group is conducted through Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
expected to be Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade
creditors and creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries,
and claims of minority stockholders and preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors generated 39.7% of the
Group’s net revenue and 31.8% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and as of March 31, 2021, represented
47.3% of the Group’s total assets (after giving effect to consolidation adjustments). As of March 31, 2021,
€13.9 million of the Group’s indebtedness was outstanding at non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including
€9.7 million of lease liabilities recognized under IFRS 16, all of which will remain outstanding following
the Refinancing. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Notes Guarantees—The Notes will be
_structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.” In addition, as of the Issue Date, we_
will have up to €80.0 million available for drawing by the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The
Notes will mature on June 15, 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

194


-----

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which an aggregate principal
amount of €500.0 million will be issued in this offering. The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the
“Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture. Any series of Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the
relevant series of Notes, as applicable, originally issued, except in respect of any of the following terms
which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) or, at the election of the Issuer, a
supplemental indenture, delivered to the Trustee:

(1) whether such Additional Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series of Notes or the
title of such Additional Notes (which shall distinguish the Additional Notes of the series from
Notes of any other series);

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest
payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of Holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency
in which cash or government obligations in connection with such Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof,
the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Notes Guarantees and Transaction Security
Documents.

The Notes (and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture) will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers and amendments,
but not, except upon the election of the Issuer, in respect of redemptions and offers to purchase; provided
that if any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
Italian tax purposes, such Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code, as
applicable, from the Notes. Unless otherwise excluded or unless the context otherwise requires, for all
purposes under the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” shall be
deemed to include the Notes issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes that are actually
issued.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 3.25% per annum. Interest on the Notes will:

   - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

   - be payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on
December 15, 2021;

   - be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date; and

   - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Interest on overdue principal and interest will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the applicable
rate of interest. In no event, however, will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum
rate permitted by applicable law.

195


-----

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the
specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to
the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents_
maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by
check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes.
See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**_Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be
Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”), and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”).
The initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar,
Transfer Agent and Paying Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on
behalf of the Issuer.

Subject to the above restrictions, the Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF
thereof and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any
change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxembourger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of
the Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by any
of its subsidiaries. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and subject to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable law, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
will be jointly and severally guaranteed, within 180 days from the Business Day falling immediately after
the Issue Date, on a senior basis by either (a) Guala Closures Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, Guala Closures
Australia Pty Ltd, Guala Closures Ibérica S.A.U., Guala Closures International B.V., Guala Closures U.K.
Limited, Guala Closures México, S.A. de C.V. and Guala Closures Servicios México, S.A. de C.V. or
(b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will have guaranteed the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement as of such date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes
_Guarantees—The Notes will not be initially guaranteed by the Guarantors or secured by the Collateral, and the_
_granting of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral is subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain_
_other limitations.”_

As described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles (including, among others, limitations arising due
to corporate benefit rules) and certain other limitations, if Subsidiaries of the Issuer in the future
guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other Indebtedness of the Issuer permitted under the
Indenture, such Person or Persons shall also enter into one or more Notes Guarantees or supplemental
indentures to become Guarantors of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on
the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory
or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent

196


-----

preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar
matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit
accruing to the Holders.

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

   - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and
other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign
corporation,” fiscal unity rules and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital
maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security
or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the
guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by the
Security Agent (acting on instructions only) before signing any applicable security or accession
document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

   - key factors in the determination of whether or not a guarantee or security will be taken (and in
respect of security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) will be: (i) the applicable time
and cost (including adverse effects on taxes (including, in the Issuer’s sole determination, in respect
of the Group, its investors and/or its shareholders), interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration
taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person that is not a member of the Group and all
applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured
Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of obtaining such guarantee or security; and
(ii) in respect of any guarantee or security which, in the determination of the Issuer (acting
reasonably), may be required to be discharged and/or released in connection with any corporate, tax
structuring or other reorganization of the Group (an “Anticipated Reorganization”), the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration
taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person that is not a member of the Group and all
applicable legal fees) of taking, and then subsequently discharging and/or releasing such guarantee
or security in connection with any Anticipated Reorganization, will not be disproportionate to the
benefit accruing to the Secured Parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

   - security that requires payment in Italy of an ad valorem registration Tax on the amount of the
security obligations will not be taken (i) unless it can be executed by way of exchange of
correspondence or in any other form required under the applicable law (other than Italian law)
governing the relevant security which does not give rise to any such ad valorem registration Tax, or
(ii) if Tax duty can be minimized on execution (including through a cap to the Secured Obligations
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as agreed by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good
faith));

   - the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the
fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a risk of personal or criminal
liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent
requested by the Security Agent (acting on instructions only) before signing any applicable security
document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall, in relation to a
contractual prohibition or restriction only, use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

   - the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration
and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent; it being in any case agreed and understood that any
Italian law security to be created by means execution of a notarial deed, if any, shall secure
exclusively the own obligations (obbligazioni proprie) of the relevant grantor, and the agreement that

197


-----

where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will
be granted over the material assets only;

- the express acknowledgement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract,
lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or
regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from
being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a
consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which,
if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in
respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the
interests of the Group or any member thereof, provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a
specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall
be used by the Group if the Security Agent (acting on instructions only) specifies prior to the date
of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such
endeavors will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the
ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents (including dealing with the secured
assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse)
any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is continuing),
and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or
not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph;

- the agreement that any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in
order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence, and no title
investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required;

- the agreement that no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired
Person or asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are
required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent such acquired indebtedness is permitted by
the Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other
entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Indenture shall be required to
become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Debt Document (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that
acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect of such Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security
would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no
security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any Indebtedness not prohibited by
the Indenture and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a
Notes Document to the contrary;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than
in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or
prevent the creation of Security Interests over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory
capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security
document);

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security
Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security
documents for all the secured parties); “parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary (and
included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents) and will apply
to the extent legally possible in certain jurisdictions (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement
and not the individual security documents) it being understood that “parallel debt” provisions shall
not apply to Transaction Security Documents governed by Italian law or guarantees provided by
Guarantors incorporated in Italy; and, furthermore, no member of the Group will be required to

198


-----

take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by
a Holder (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Indenture, no member of the Group
shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any
other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a Holder, beneficial
owner of the Notes, the Trustee, the Security Agent or any Agent);

   - the agreement that each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any
transaction not prohibited under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
granted under each security document entered into after the Issue Date shall be deemed to be
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security
document and creation of the relevant security; and no security may be provided on terms which are
inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

   - the agreement that no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap
Obligations” defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15,
2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto
by the LSTA;

   - the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing
or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the
Group; and no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any
security will be required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless required for such
documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and an Event of Default is continuing;

   - the closure, unavailability, or reduced service of any governmental or regulatory systems, any
functions or any facilities (including notarial or legal facilities) necessary or customarily used for the
granting of security or guarantees, or the taking of any perfection requirements in connection
therewith, may affect and/or delay the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or
security or take any related steps in connection with any perfection requirements;

   - the agreement that where the terms of a security document require a party thereto (other than a
Secured Party) to use its “reasonable efforts,” “reasonable endeavors” or a similar or equivalent
standard in taking an action thereunder, notwithstanding any meaning to the contrary as a matter of
the governing law of such security document, such standards shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with the law of England and Wales and no Default or Event of Default (howsoever
described) shall arise under any Note Document in respect of a breach of such obligation because a
contrary construction of such provision was taken (or would be taken by any applicable court of
competent jurisdiction);

  - the agreement that each security document must contain language which provides that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such security document, but without prejudice to the
creation or perfection of any security interest under the applicable security document, the terms of
the security document shall not operate or be construed so as to prohibit or restrict any transaction,
matter or other step (or the grantor taking or entering into the same or dealing in any manner
whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits, proceeds and
documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto)) permitted by the Debt
Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (other than the applicable security
document), and the Security Agent shall promptly enter into such documentation and/or take such
other action in relation to the applicable security document as is required by the grantor (acting
reasonably) in order to facilitate any such transaction, matter or other step, including by way of
executing any confirmation, consent to dealing, release or other similar or equivalent document, or
returning any physical collateral; and

   - the agreement that the guarantees and security to be provided in respect of the Notes in accordance
with the Agreed Security Principles are only to be given by wholly owned Material Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) incorporated in Australia, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction in which a borrower under the
Revolving Credit Facility is incorporated and any other jurisdiction agreed between the Company
(in its sole discretion) and the Majority Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) (acting reasonably) and not in any other jurisdiction (each other jurisdiction being an
“Excluded Jurisdiction”).

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith
by the Issuer.

199


-----

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, unlawful financial assistance or
infringement of capital maintenance or corporate benefit rules under applicable law, and otherwise to
reflect limitations under applicable law or as set out in the respective Notes Guarantee. Any Notes
Guarantee will be subject to additional certain contractual and legal limitations, as described under
“—Notes Guarantees,” “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes_
_and the Notes Guarantees—The insolvency and administrative laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions_
_may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with_
_which you are familiar; other limitations on the Notes Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance statutes,_
_may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” In addition, the Notes Guarantee may be released under certain_
circumstances. See “—Notes Guarantees Release.”

The Guarantors will also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on
or prior to the date on which the Guarantors will provide their respective Notes Guarantees. Prior to the
granting of the Notes Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any
existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the
expected Guarantors until such time that such entities provide a Notes Guarantee). A portion of the
operations of the Group is conducted through Restricted Subsidiaries that are not expected to be
Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and
creditors holding claims under debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of
minority stockholders and preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of
creditors of the Issuer, including Holders. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Although the Indenture will restrict the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in excess of the limitations described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture_
will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that
are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon:

(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, dissolution or merger) of the
Capital Stock of a Guarantor that immediately prior to such sale or other disposition was a
Subsidiary of the Issuer (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
the sale or other disposition;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
or any event occurs after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance
with the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including an IPO Debt Pushdown);

(5) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released
and discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
(ii) is not providing a Guarantee of any other Credit Facility or Public Debt at the time;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;_

200


-----

(8) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations under the Notes;

(9) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”;_

(10) with respect to any Guarantor (i) in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor
pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) in connection with, or the resignation is required to give effect to
any step, reorganization or action related to a Permitted Reorganization; or

(11) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

At the request and expense of the Issuer and, if applicable, at the request of the Security Agent, the
Trustee shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release or
amendment of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications. Each of the releases and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. The
Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to any release or
amendment of a Notes Guarantee has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes will not be secured on the Issue Date. Within ten Business Days of (and excluding) the
later of (i) the date on which SPSI acquires, directly or indirectly, 100% of the voting share capital of the
Issuer and (ii) the Issue Date, Topco will grant a share pledge in respect of the shares it owns in the Issuer
(“Issuer Share Pledge”). Within 20 Business Days of (and excluding) the Issue Date, the Issuer shall grant a
Dutch law-governed share pledge over the shares that it holds in Guala Closures International B.V. (the
“Dutch Share Pledge”). Within 180 days from the Business Day falling immediately after the Issue Date,
(i) each Guarantor shall grant: (a) a share pledge in respect of its shares in the capital of each other
Guarantor owned by it, to the extent it is wholly owned; and (b) a receivables security assignment in
respect of material, structural, long-term, documented receivables owed to it by any other Guarantor; and
(ii) Guala Closures International B.V. will grant a pledge over the shares it holds in Guala Closures DGS
Poland S.A. (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral”).

The Issuer Share Pledge, the Dutch Share Pledge and the Post-Closing Collateral, together with any
and all assets from time to time in which a Security Interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any
Transaction Security Document to secure the obligations under the Indenture or the Notes and/or any
Notes Guarantee, in each case as may be in existence from time to time, is referred to herein as the
“Collateral”.

The assets that comprise the Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations (if any) on a first-priority basis. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to
certain hedging obligations, in each case, contractually will be entitled to receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may also secure certain future Indebtedness on the same basis as
the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if any) with respect to the receipt of
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral after all such “super senior” obligations have been satisfied may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, and subject to the restrictions described under “—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer will be
permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged or assigned, pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents, to the
Security Agent on behalf of the Holders, the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility and other
secured parties. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under

201


-----

the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” Any future
additional Collateral will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and all Collateral will be subject to
any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under
or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
“Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—It may be difficult to realize the value of the_
_Collateral securing the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—The_
_Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created
by the Transaction Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between
(a) the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent
(collectively, the “Agents”) and the Holders under the Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other
Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes and the Transaction Security Documents, which will
provide, among other things, that the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
Hedging Obligations, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured equally and ratably by first
priority Security Interests over the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide, among other
things, that the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain Hedging Obligations will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the
Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, subject
to certain limitations, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future Indebtedness, some of which may
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. See “—Release of Liens,”
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral
_Liens.”_

**_Transaction Security Documents_**

Under the Transaction Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the
payment, when due, of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and the Indenture, as well as the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations. The Transaction Security Documents will be
entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent for itself and as agent and as legal
representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) for the secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement
and as Security Representative (as defined below). When entering into the Transaction Security
Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name and as legal representative (mandatario con
_rappresentanza), but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of_
Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent
and as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) of the finance parties under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (if any) in relation to the
Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right
to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a
consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in
respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will
(subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (including in its role

202


-----

as Security Representative). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent (including in its role
as Security Representative) also acts on behalf of the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility
and the counterparties under certain hedging arrangements in relation to the Security Interests in favor of
such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Transaction Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured
by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been
discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released
under certain circumstances as described under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Transaction Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any
challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was
successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Transaction Security
Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.”

**_Enforcement of Security Interest; Limitations_**

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations
secured by the Collateral (if any) and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be
deemed to have, appointed, also for the purposes of Article 1704 (mandato con rappresentanza) of the
Italian Civil Code, the Security Agent to act as its agent and legal representative (mandatario con
_rappresentanza) under the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents securing such_
Indebtedness, including the Transaction Security Documents. Furthermore, each Holder will have deemed
to have appointed the Security Agent as mandatario con rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the
Italian Civil Code and as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties
to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral (if any) and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note,
each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise
the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Transaction Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights,
power and discretions; and (ii) execute each relevant Transaction Security Document, waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent in its
name and on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section
entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be
deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Transaction
Security Documents;

(2) authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf
to enter into the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be
bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights
thereunder in accordance therewith;

(3) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents;
(4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as representative
(rappresentante) of the noteholders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code;

(5) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Security Interests in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents; and

203


-----

(6) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and
comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Transaction Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—Holders
_of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into as described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer, its Subsidiaries and any other provider of Collateral, as applicable, will be entitled to
release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Issuer Share Pledge
if granted) to (a) any Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited under the Indenture or (b) to_
any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a
transfer of Capital Stock, obligations under proceeds loans owed to the Issuer, or accounts
receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain
subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following such transfer,
sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in
“—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and
Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) upon the contribution of any claim of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which is subject to
a Lien, to the equity of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that such
contribution is made in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in connection with a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture pursuant to which such security
provider is being liquidated, wound up, or dissolved (or pursuant to which it will otherwise cease
to exist), a Permitted Reorganization or in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer
of assets in compliance with the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation”, including, for the avoidance of doubt, as may be required in connection with_
the Transactions;

(8) upon achievement of the conditions described under “—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants and Release of Security Interests on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”; provided_
that if a Reversion Date occurs, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the limitations
described in this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts
for a Lien of substantially equivalent value to such Lien that was released in reliance on this
clause to be re-taken to the extent that the Group continues to own such assets that had
constituted Collateral on such date; or

(9) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Transaction Security Documents will be released
(a) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including

204


-----

in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown) and (b) as may be permitted under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest.”_

At the request and expense of the Issuer or the relevant pledgor, the Security Agent and, to the extent
required or necessary, the Trustee will take all reasonably necessary action required to effectuate any
release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Transaction Security Document, subject to customary protections and indemnification, if applicable. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders
or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security
Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the
Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

   - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

   - Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
“Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of
a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S.

Subject to the foregoing, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry; Interests in the 144A Global Note only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A) in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in
accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the two immediately preceding paragraphs
will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry; Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred
and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar

205


-----

of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or
as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a
legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under
“Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the
transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and
to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed
in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to
treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be Restricted Subsidiaries for the
purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants
in the Indenture.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will provide (and
the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the
Transaction Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as
described in “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions
_Following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required (at the expense of the Issuer) to_
enter into any amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or the Transaction Security Documents required by the Issuer and/or take such
other action as is required by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by
this paragraph; provided that such amendment will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
the Security Agent or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the
Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—There are
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be released_
_automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the
Notes are not redeemable until June 15, 2024.

206


-----

At any time prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.

In addition, prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including the aggregate principal
amount of any Additional Notes) upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice, with
funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at
redemption price of 103.25% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date; provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes (excluding the principal amount of any
Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption;
and

(2) the redemption occurs with 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time from time to time prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, during each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original
principal amount of any Additional Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written
notice, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date.

On and after June 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes, upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period
beginning on June 15 of the years indicated below:

**_General_**

Subject to compliance with the covenants contained herein, the Issuer and its affiliates may at any
time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be made through open market or
privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or any such
affiliates may determine, and the amounts purchased may be material.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note
is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (provided,
_however, that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which_
such notice is first given except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and

207


-----

discharge of the Indenture pursuant to the provisions thereof), or such redemption may not occur and such
notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change
of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third
party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30
days following such purchase date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part
following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered to each other
Holder of Notes in such tender offer to the extent not prohibited by law and to the extent that doing so
would not result in adverse tax consequences to the Issuer (as determined in the sole discretion of the
Issuer), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date. Without prejudice to any provision of the Indenture
regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer,
including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer
or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed
to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On June 15, 2028, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or
purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar (as applicable) will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes
issued in global form as discussed under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” based on a method that most
nearly approximates a pro rata selection in accordance with the procedures of the Relevant Clearing
System), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary
requirements. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections
made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a leading
newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxembourger Wort) and in
addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail
such notice to Holders by first class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on
the registration books of the Registrar. While in global form, notices to Holders may be delivered via
Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail. Such notice of redemption may instead be
published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered
Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any
Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Global Note (or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
the Relevant Clearing System) to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

208


-----

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional
Amounts (as defined below under “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the
Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines that, as a
result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or written interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or published guidance) (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee (but, in the case of
a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such
Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue
Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any
successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change
or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption
will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make
such payment of Additional Amounts and unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay
such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption
of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or successor Person, as applicable, will deliver to the Trustee
(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement
of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the
relevant Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has
been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee
will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any
successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Italy or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment with respect to any such Note or Notes
Guarantee is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax, by or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or

209


-----

governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and
(3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received
in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been
received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on
account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder
is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding,
in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such
Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the
Indenture or a Notes Guarantee; or

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor or any other person through
whom payment can be made addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or
such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from,
or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; or

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note
for payment (where the Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the
Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts);
or

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with
respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee; or

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge; or

(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time
(“Legislative Decree No. 239”) and pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of
November 21, 1997, unless the procedures required under Legislative Decree No. 239 in order to
benefit from an exemption from imposta sostitutiva have not been complied with due to actions or
omissions of the Issuer or its agents; and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) no Additional Amounts
shall be payable with respect to any Taxes to the extent such Taxes result from payment to a
non-Italian resident legal entity or a non-Italian resident individual which are subject to imposta
_sostitutiva by reason of not being resident in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of_
information with Italy (commonly referred to as the “white list”) and (B) no Additional Amounts
shall be payable with respect to Taxes to the extent such Taxes are for or on account of imposta
_sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject to imposta sostitutiva after the Issue Date by reason of_
any amendment to the white list, currently provided by the Ministerial Decree dated
September 4, 1996, as amended from time to time, whereby such Holder’s country of residence
does not appear on the new list; or

210


-----

(7) any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections
1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (or, in each case, any amended
or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an
intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary
or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held
such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance
with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain and provide certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax
receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments
as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available
to the Holders upon reasonable request, and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The
Payor will attach to each such certified copy or other evidence of such payments a certificate stating that
the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy or other evidence was paid in connection
with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made with
respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor
will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary
to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless
such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in
which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive
proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse the Holders and beneficial owners for any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (or, with respect to enforcement, in any jurisdiction) from the execution, delivery, registration,
enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or
any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, (A) in connection with a
transfer of the Notes after this offering or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or any similar charges or levies becomes payable upon a voluntary registration made by
the Holder if such registration is not required by any applicable law or not necessary to maintain, preserve,
establish or enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Notes Guarantees,
the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto) and limited, solely to the extent of
such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest

211


-----

on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through
(3) and (5) through (7) of the second paragraph under this section).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture
and/or any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes
(or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms
of this covenant, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal
to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may
only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to
repurchase Notes as described under this covenant, in the event and to the extent that a notice of
redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition
precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied or waived.

Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change
of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of
any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such
Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part (in integral multiples of
€1,000 and provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in
part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is
not paid, and that any Notes or any part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control
Triggering Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have
occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change
of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the

212


-----

Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have
been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly, at the cost of the
Issuer, mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for
such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to the Change of Control
Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
Luxembourger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the
official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture will
not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes
in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to
repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party
from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of
negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible
that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control
Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control
Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the
consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith. The Issuer may
rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event would require the Issuer to make a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such
agreements may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events
that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the
Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be
limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources and whether the Restricted Subsidiaries are
permitted to distribute funds to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the
_Notes Guarantees—We may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase_

213


-----

_your Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” (as defined in the_
_Indenture) as required by the Indenture. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right_
_to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_
_tender” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—We will depend on payments from other_
_Group companies and in particular its subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property and assets of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

the good faith determination of the Issuer for such type of arrangement or except for Standard
Securitization Undertakings); (c) outstanding or available for Incurrence as of the Issue Date; or
(d) not in excess of the greater of €25.0 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA at any time

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of
the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the
Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one
(or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the first or second paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed Incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or
secured pursuant to the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Liens” shall be deemed to
include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease
or discharge any such Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions,
including after giving effect to additional Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premia and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such renewal, refund, redemption, refinancing, replacement, restructuring,
defeasance or discharge. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant or any provision of
the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens,” the maximum amount that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur and/or secure pursuant to this covenant and/or the covenant set
forth in “—Limitation on Liens” shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such
Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated
EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to
be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or
replacement, such excess will continue);

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause
of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

218


-----

(9) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness (including interest paid in kind), the payment of dividends in the form of additional
shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant, nor to be the Incurrence of a Lien
under the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Lien securing such
originally Incurred Preferred Stock or Indebtedness was secured in accordance with the
Indenture. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted
value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the
principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(10) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and without prejudice to the section
“—Financial and Other Calculations” and subject to the last paragraph of this covenant, in the
event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted
Collateral Lien, the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture,
including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or use of clauses (1) through (17) of the
preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re borrowings thereunder (and including
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the
Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry
into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of
such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage, as applicable, test or other
provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re
borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Secured Net Leverage, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any
borrowing or re borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance
and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of
this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Secured Net Leverage, as applicable, or other provision of
the Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1) through (17) of the preceding paragraph
(if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be
determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased
commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from
time to time.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Issuer shall be in
Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower euro-equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in
a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro denominated restriction
to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the

219


-----

principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of
the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different
currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable
on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into
account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

described in this clause (c) shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available
for distribution pursuant to clause (c) of the immediately following paragraph and clauses

extent) that any net proceeds described in this clause (c) are contributed to the Issuer or a

the redemption, defeasance, repurchase, exchange or other acquisition or retirement of any such
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio shall be no greater
than 4.25 to 1.0.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and without prejudice to the section
“—Financial and Other Calculations,” in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) (i) meets
the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the third paragraph of
this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first or second paragraphs of this covenant and/or
(iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair
market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any
non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors or a member of
senior management of the Issuer acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in
a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or
otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s
Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and
to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or
indirect” action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except
(a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens
on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes
and all payments due under the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to (in the
case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness), the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien
for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set
forth under “—Security—Release of Liens” or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant Transaction Security Document.

225


-----

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the
amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value,
the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness
with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the
amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or
increases in the value of property securing such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving
Credit Facility) and any guarantees related thereto, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security
Documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on
the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with
an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer

contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (1) or (3) of this paragraph or this clause (5); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are (i) no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than
the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer) or
(ii) customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of this sub clause (ii), the Issuer
determines at the time of Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions
would not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Issuer);

(6) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or

restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Notes or the Indenture,
together with the Transaction Security Documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is
not less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or other assets subject to such
Asset Disposition (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any Net Available Cash received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or a Restricted
Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest
balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness and Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any
Guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second
paragraph of this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such
Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is
not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of €20.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market
value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in sub clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash
of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances in clause (8) below) of the later
of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than pursuant

228


-----

subclauses (1)(c) or (1)(d) thereof (or any refinancing under subclause (1)(e) related thereto));
(ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (a) the
Notes and/or (b) Indebtedness (other than the Notes, Subordinated Indebtedness or
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is secured by a Lien on the
Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes (including Indebtedness that, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement has priority in respect of the
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral) at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is
secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price in cash equal to at least
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to_
purchase any amount of the Notes at a price not less than par, to the extent Holders elect not to
tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net
Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered, and such amount shall not increase the
amount of Excess Proceeds;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business,
if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clauses (1) through
(6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment
until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day
following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been
consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce_
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not
prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day, if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been
entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount
of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €20.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will
be required within ten Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to
purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the
Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in
respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price
of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari
Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the

229


-----

Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants
contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of
calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness
shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a
date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated
in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof
payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such
Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not
less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
_Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari_
Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly_
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has
been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than
five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a
new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon
delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased
portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a
minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any
or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and
statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any
Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer
in its reasonable discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this covenant.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14e-1 of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes
pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not
recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

230


-----

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange
of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or
series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the
greater of €10.0 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€20.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of
related transactions have been approved or ratified by a resolution of the majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with
clause (1) above; provided that any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied
the requirements set forth in this clause if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of
the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third
paragraph thereof) and any agreement related to such Restricted Payments or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11), (14) and
(19) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options, other equityrelated investments or other warrants or securities or rights to purchase Capital Stock, or other

compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved or ratified by the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto, or Parent Entity
Expenses;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or with an entity that
is not an Affiliate that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or
between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or

indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors,
officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) (a) the Transactions, (b) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any

than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the
Issuer (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or an Associate or similar entity that would

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities

All financial statement information shall be prepared on a basis consistent with IFRS as in effect on
the date of such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except,

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the
entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s (a) total revenue or
Consolidated EBITDA for the Relevant Testing Period or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the
most recently completed fiscal quarter or month for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee tested after giving effect to such transaction in the case of an acquisition and prior
to giving effect to such transaction in the case of a disposition.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this “—Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face
of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations
of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent Entity becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it
continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to
the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer)
the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S.
GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so
long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent Entity, as applicable, is, or would be, required to file with
the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

The Issuer may comply with the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant by providing any
report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity, any IPO Entity or a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Issuer that represents substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (any such entity, a “Financial Reporting Entity”) so long as such reports (if an annual or
quarterly report) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2)
of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to such Financial Reporting Entity;
_provided that if the report or financial statements of a Financial Reporting Entity are provided to meet the_
requirements of clause (1) or (2) of this covenant in accordance with this sentence for any period after the
Issue Date, a reasonably detailed unaudited description of material differences between the financial
statements of the Financial Reporting Entity and the Issuer shall be included in such report or financial
statements. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the
Indenture, the Issuer may use financial statements of a predecessor of the Financial Reporting Entity for
reporting or making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Issue Date. Upon
complying with the foregoing requirements in this paragraph, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, for so long as the Issuer is listed on the Milan Stock Exchange,
and in the event that, and for so long as the equity securities of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or IPO Entity
are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange or one or more of the equivalent regulated
markets of the Milan Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Paris Stock Exchange or another
internationally recognized stock exchange (any of the foregoing, an “International Exchange”), and the
Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable
to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such International Exchange, for so long as it elects,

234


-----

the Issuer will make available to the Trustee, or provide on its website, such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is, or would be, required
to file with such International Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this covenant is for
informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of
any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the
Indenture.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be made in the English language. If the due date
for any report set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above is not a Business Day, the Issuer or Financial
Reporting Entity permitted under this covenant will be entitled to provide such report on the next
succeeding Business Day.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

Except as set forth under “—General” below, the Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with
or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose all or substantially all of
the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as an entirety or substantially as
an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
_Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the_
European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, including any State of the
United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (in each
case, subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles), (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, and (b) all
obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer,
as applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee (a) an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the
Indenture and (b) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that in the case of the Successor Issuer,
such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a
legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of
any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with
respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially

235


-----

all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_Future Guarantors_

Except as set forth under “—General” below, no future Guarantor of the Notes (other than a
Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition) will, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with
or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person,
unless:

(1) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease, sell or other disposition;

(2) (a) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security
Documents, as applicable (such resulting, surviving or transferee Person (other than the Issuer),
the “Successor Guarantor”); and (b) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(3) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture.

_provided, however, that the prohibition in this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that compliance with_
clauses (1) and (2)(a) could give rise to or result in: (A) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance
rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any
applicable jurisdiction; (B) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership);
or (C) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable
out of pocket expenses.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor
from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or a
Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of any Guarantor into the Issuer; provided that, if the Issuer is
not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations
of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The
_Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (iv) the Transactions or a Permitted Reorganization; and (v) the_
Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in

236


-----

another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1) and (4)
under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (1) through (3) under the heading “—Future Guarantors,” as
the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction. None of the provisions under this covenant shall apply
to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest
with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that (i) the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or
the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, (ii) the occurrence of or
implementation or any step in the Transactions or any Permitted Reorganization and (iii) the
implementation of an IPO Pushdown shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the
Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the
Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the
Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any
Transaction Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens or to add to the
Collateral, (ii) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement,
release or otherwise modify or replace any Transaction Security Documents for the purposes of
undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, the Transaction, an IPO Pushdown or a transaction not
prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (iii) the Collateral may be
discharged, released and retaken, if applicable, in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable
Transaction Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (iv) the applicable Transaction Security Documents may be amended from time to time to
cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein, (v) to amend, extend, renew,
restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release any Transaction Security Documents followed
by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets and (vi) the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely
affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i), (v) and (vi) above,
the Transaction Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any
such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (a) a solvency opinion, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as
applicable), after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (b) a certificate from the Board of
Directors of the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the Issuer or the relevant Person granting
such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (c) an Opinion of Counsel, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Transaction Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are
valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at
law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, each of the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee
the Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Revolving Credit Facility) or any Public Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless

237


-----

such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 20 Business Days from (but excluding) the
date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes
Guarantee would be inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention
of title claims or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction;
(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor’s liability to
the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law (including any usury laws).

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be
a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with
the 20-Business Day period described in this covenant. The Indenture will provide that this covenant shall
not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“—The Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also
be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor as at that date.
The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases
or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate
any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and
the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness
referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms
as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of
the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as
applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of
any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that
may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including

238


-----

with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or the
Transaction, (7) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (9) make any other change to
any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect.
In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request
and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their
respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction
would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Suspension of Covenants and Release of Security Interests on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that
day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
“Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;
(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Issuer”;_

(7) “—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

(8) the second paragraph of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any
effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event,
and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The
covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the second, third and fourth
paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since

239


-----

the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date,
all Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Event will be deemed to have been classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during_
any continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(b) of the
second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” and (b) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in
clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions
_on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any continuance of a_
Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second paragraph of
the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”

In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer
or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future
after the Reversion Date as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension
Event and not in anticipation of the Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings
of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty
to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion
Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this
caption (including the paragraph immediately following) have been satisfied, provided that, no such
notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants or the release of the Security Interests
in respect of the Notes described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to
notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

The Issuer will have the right on and from the date on which the Notes achieve Investment Grade
Status to release from time to time any of the property and other assets included in the Collateral from the
Liens securing the Notes upon the Issuer delivering to the Trustee and the Security Agent an Officer’s
Certificate identifying the Collateral to be released and certifying that (a) the Notes have achieved
Investment Grade Status, (b) no Default or Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is
continuing and (c) such Collateral has been or, simultaneously with any release relating to the Notes, will
be, released under any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than the obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility, Hedging Obligations or other Indebtedness which is entitled to receive proceeds of an
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes in a manner not materially less favorable to the
Holders than that accorded to the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement). This shall be in addition to the Security Agent’s and the Trustee’s entitlement
to request and rely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying that such release
complies with the Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve Investment Grade Status. There are also
circumstances other than the achievement of Investment Grade Status that would result in a release of the
Security Interests in respect of the Collateral. See “—Security—Release of Liens” and “—IPO Debt
_Pushdown.”_

**_Financial and Other Calculations_**

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or
components thereof) in the Notes Documents, including when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting)
Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Testing Period (including the portion thereof occurring prior to
any relevant Purchase (as defined below)), the Issuer may: (a) if during such period any member of the
Group (by merger or otherwise) has made or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make
an Investment in any person that thereby becomes (or that the Issuer expects in good faith, based upon
such commitment, will become) a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise has acquired or committed
(unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to acquire any entity, business, property or material fixed asset
(including the acquisition, opening and/or development of any new site or operation) (any such
Investment, acquisition or commitment (including under a letter of intent) therefor, a “Purchase”),
including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made
under the Indenture or the other Notes Documents, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on
the basis that the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same basis

240


-----

as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such
Purchase during such Relevant Testing Period shall be included as if the Purchase occurred on the first day
of such Relevant Testing Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment in respect of any Purchase and/or any
steps taken or committed or expected to be taken (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in
respect of such Purchase up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected
by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which
the Issuer (in good faith) determines have been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during
such Relevant Testing Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Purchase or any related steps,
without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already
included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such Synergies have been or will be realized at
any time during such Relevant Testing Period, it may be assumed they were realized during the entirety of
such Relevant Testing Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be
achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Purchase or any
related steps (the “Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies”), provided that so long as such Forward-Looking
Purchase Synergies will be realizable at any time in the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable
during the entire such period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the
Relevant Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Purchase.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or
components thereof) in the Notes Documents, including when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting)
Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Testing Period (including the portion thereof occurring prior to
any relevant Sale (as defined below)), the Issuer may: (a) if during such period any member of the Group
has disposed or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make a disposal of any person,
property, business or material fixed asset or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business
sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Group (any such sale, transfer, disposition or commitment
therefor, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA relates
to such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA
will be reduced by an amount equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if positive)
attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount
equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated on the
same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for such period
as if the Sale occurred on the first day of such Relevant Testing Period; and/or (b) include an adjustment
in respect of any Sale and/or any steps taken or committed or expected to be taken (in each case,
unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such Sale up to the amount of the pro forma increase
in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full “run
rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have been or will be achieved
(in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Testing Period directly or indirectly as a consequence
of the Sale or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant
Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such Synergies
have been realized at any time during such Relevant Testing Period, it may be assumed they were realized
during the entirety of such Relevant Testing Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good
faith) believes can be achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of
the Sale or any related steps (the “Forward-Looking Sale Synergies”), provided that so long as such
Forward-Looking Sale Synergies will be realizable at any time in the future, it may be assumed they will be
realizable during the entire such period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized
during the Relevant Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or (c) exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Sale.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or
components thereof) in the Notes Documents, including when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting)
Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Testing Period (including the portion thereof occurring prior to
implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative), the Issuer may: (a) include an
adjustment in respect of each Group Initiative and/or any steps taken or committed or expected to be
taken (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) in respect of such Group Initiative up to the
amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after
taking into account the full “run rate” effect of: (i) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good faith)
determines have been or will be achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such Relevant Testing
Period directly or indirectly as a consequence of implementing or committing to implement such Group

241


-----

Initiative or any related steps, without prejudice to the Synergies actually realized during the Relevant
Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such Synergies
have been realized at any time during such Relevant Testing Period, it may be assumed they were realized
during the entirety of such Relevant Testing Period; and/or (ii) all Synergies which the Issuer (in good
faith) believes can be achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of
implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any related steps (the “Forward_Looking Group Initiative Synergies” and together with the Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies and the_
Forward-Looking Sale Synergies, the “Forward-Looking Synergies”), provided that so long as such ForwardLooking Group Initiative Synergies will be realizable at any time in the future, it may be assumed they will
be realizable during the entire such period; in each case, without prejudice to the Synergies actually
realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA; and/or
(b) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the implementation
of, or commitment to, implement such Group Initiative.

In relation to the definitions set out in the Indenture and all other related provisions of the Notes
Documents (including any Applicable Metric), all calculations in respect of Synergies (in each case actual
or anticipated) may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such Synergies were realized on the first
day of the Relevant Testing Period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the
Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof, the
Issuer shall be permitted to: (a) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or
the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (i) the Transactions; (ii) any other
acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from
purchase price accounting; (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing
businesses; (iv) costs or expenses relating to employee relocation, retraining, severance and termination,
business interruption, reorganization and other restructuring or cost cutting measures, the rationalization,
re-branding, start-up, reduction or elimination of product lines, assets or businesses, the consolidation,
relocation or closure of retail, administrative or production locations and other similar items (for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure); (v) research and development expenditure
(and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with
_Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent_
measure under the accounting principles) or any other changes in the applicable accounting principles;
and/or (b) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including
anticipated Synergies) or costs or expenses related to the Transaction and/or any base case model or
quality of earnings report relating to a Permitted Acquisition prepared by an independent third party and/
or taken into account in determining “Adjusted EBITDA” or any financing EBITDA to be used in
connection with financing for a Permitted Acquisition and/or any research and development expenditure
(which is not otherwise capitalized).

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at
the option of the Issuer, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable
Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions
that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma
calculation may exclude any nonrecurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable
Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph,
such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes;
provided that (a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the
basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter
be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save
as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or
tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test
Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have
been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric),
such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as

242


-----

a result of such fluctuations. If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any
continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as
of the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with
or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such
requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied.

Subject to clause (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or_
transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior
to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines
(in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable
Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is
committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or
any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio- based
Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other
Indebtedness which is available to be redrawn howsoever described or structured (including under the
Revolving Credit Facility or any ancillary facility under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and, for
the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving
Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
_permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower_
permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of
a Permitted Acquisition or Permitted Investment (after taking into account any pro forma “run rate”
adjustments as a result of such transaction in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture), the
numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission
reached from time to time as a result of any such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted Investments
and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric,
the Issuer may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that
amount or transaction to a particular Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount
or transaction in one of those Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the
option of the Issuer be split between different Applicable Metrics).

The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” under the Indenture or
any other Notes Document shall include references to such matters not being prohibited or otherwise
being approved under the Indenture or such other Notes Document and (ii) any transaction being in the
“ordinary course of business” of a member of the Group shall be construed to include any transaction that
is consistent with industry practice in the industries in which the Group operates or consistent with past
practice of any member of the Group.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant
Testing Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an
“Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference
(if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period (or any
such other preceding period as specified in such Applicable Metric) and the amount thereof
actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry-Forward
_Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 50% of the permitted amount in the immediately_
following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period
shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry-Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable

243


-----

Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first,
against the Carry-Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted
during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and
(C) third, against the Carry-Back Amount.

For the purpose of this section and to the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole
or in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on
a pro forma basis) no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in
double counting.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon acceleration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with their
respective other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there
may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which
default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which
has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of €30.0 million and 30% of Consolidated
EBITDA or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, a Significant Subsidiary
or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy
_provisions”);_

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of
€30.0 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent
insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or
stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Transaction Security Documents having a fair market value in
excess of the greater of €20.0 million and an amount equal to 20% of Consolidated EBITDA
shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of
the relevant Transaction Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of
all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with

244


-----

the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable, or the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary that has granted such Security Interest shall assert in writing that any such Security
Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for ten days; and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not
cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after
receipt of such notice; provided that notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken or
reported to the Trustee more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any time period providing for
the cure of any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default described under the first paragraph of this
section may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged
Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due
and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of
Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or
the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days
after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the
Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all
existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to
an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a
notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event
of Default under the first paragraph of this section or direction to take (or refrain to take) any other action
with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder
_Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a_
written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in
the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the
Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that
are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder
Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of
Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. Any Directing Holder that does
not provide a Position Representation with a Noteholder Direction shall be deemed to have voted its
interest as a Holder without discretion in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to
such matter by Holders who are not Net Short. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of
providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer
may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s
Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any
case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any
Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial
owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant

245


-----

time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that
there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position
Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction
seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position
Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed
pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If
such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in
accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a
Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction
rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its
Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing
Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of
such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such
Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such
Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed
never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to
have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall
not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder
Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification
Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction.
Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite
level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee
shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken
or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
Noteholder Direction (provided that the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance
with the provisions of the preceding paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with
the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any Agent) shall not
be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing
provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the
Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to
monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the
merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case
may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its
Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings
undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default
has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with
respect to any Net Short position or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights,
protections and benefits under the Indenture at all times, including without limitation for actions that are
taken and subsequently stayed or annulled.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or
Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the
consent of Holders holding 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the

246


-----

Indenture)) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to
the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect
to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee
to pursue the remedy, and such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or
Verification Covenant;

(3) such Holders, or Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation (as
applicable), have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of such indemnity and/or security; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice or has actual knowledge, the Trustee
will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in
the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with
law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder
or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the
Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking
such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal
of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous
year and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default that has
occurred and is continuing, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed under “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such provision or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such

247


-----

circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to
it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, any mandatory provisions of Italian law in force from time to time and
compliance with the provisions described in “—Meetings of Holders of Notes”, the Notes Documents may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived under the Indenture with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

However, subject to any mandatory provisions of Italian law in force from time to time, without the
consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes
affected, an amendment or waiver under the Indenture may not, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of
principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts on, if any, such Holder’s Notes on or after the
due dates therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to any mandatory provisions of Italian law in force from time
to time, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent may under the
Indenture amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document, including, without limitation, in connection
with the Transactions;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the
provision described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security_
to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge
or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Transaction
Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes
when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the
Indenture, the Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) conform the text of the Indenture, the Transaction Security Documents or the Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of
_the Notes” was intended to be a recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Intercreditor_
Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or
Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the
Trustee or the Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders and/or parties to the
Revolving Credit Facility, in any property which is required by the Transaction Security
Documents, the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged,
pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security
Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of
any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the provisions
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) release any Guarantor from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or

_and Subsidiary Stock”;_

(13) make any amendment of an administrative or ministerial nature to the provisions of the
Indenture or any Notes Document to facilitate the Transactions, a Permitted Reorganization or
an IPO Debt Pushdown; or

(14) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely
on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by subsections (3) and (6) in respect of providing for a Notes Guarantee, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture or Notes Guarantee (or such other instrument) of such
additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor
and (iii) the Trustee.

249


-----

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to
Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in
any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the
Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes and mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Transaction
Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to
the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to_
such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to
the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of
the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer
exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses
(1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), (4), (5)
(with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to
the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law after the
date hereof);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
and

(4) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

250


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the
Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the
Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and
certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been
released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent)
by the Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness
on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any,
and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all
other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to both the
Paying Agent and the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of
such Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions
precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with as to such Notes, provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses
(1), (2) and (3)).

**Meetings of Holders**

All meetings of Holders of the Notes will be held in accordance with applicable Italian laws and
regulations in force from time to time (including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, Legislative
Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998). In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described
above under the caption “—Amendments and Waivers”, in accordance with the provisions set forth under
the Italian Civil Code and any mandatory Italian laws and regulations in force from time to time, the
Indenture will include provisions for the convening of meetings of the Holders to consider any matter
affecting their interests, including, without limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary
resolution of any provisions of the Notes or the Indenture. The provisions set out in the Indenture will be
deemed to be amended, replaced and supplemented to the extent that any Italian laws and regulations
dealing with the meetings of the Holders of the Notes or the relevant provisions in the by-laws of the Issuer
are amended at any time imposing a change to such provisions while the Notes remain outstanding. In
accordance with Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code, the meeting of the Holders of the Notes is
empowered to resolve upon the following matters: (i) the appointment and revocation of the Noteholders’
Representative (as defined below), (ii) any amendment to the terms and conditions of the Notes,
(iii) motions for the composition with creditors (concordato) of the Issuer; (iv) establishment of a fund for
the expenses necessary for the protection of the common interests of the Holders and the related
statements of account; and (v) any other matter of common interest to the Holders of the Notes.

A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by the Noteholders’
Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least 5.0% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the
Holders of Notes (including any adjourned meeting) will be:

(a) from the Issue Date and prior to delisting (if any) of the Issuer Shares, on any matter other than
the matters described under Article 2415, paragraph 1, item 2 of the Italian Civil Code (as
indicated below), one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any meeting
of the Holders of Notes will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or
represent Holders of more than one-fifth of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding

251


-----

Notes; provided, however, that the Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent
permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals, as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item
2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the amendment of the economic terms and
conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary resolution passed at a
meeting of Holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons
present that hold or represent Holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes; and

(b) following a delisting (if any) of the Issuer Shares, (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more
persons that hold or represent Holders of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any further adjourned meeting,
one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two thirds of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or
further adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold
or represent Holders of more than one third of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes; provided, however, that the Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum
(to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals, as set out under Article 2415
paragraph 1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the amendment of the
economic terms and conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary
resolution passed at a meeting of Holders (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more
persons present that hold or represent Holders of not less than one half of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and Waivers,”
and to the extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to
pass an extraordinary resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees—
_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all_
_noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the outstanding Notes.” Any resolution duly passed at any_
such meeting shall be binding on all the Holders, whether or not such Holder was present at such meeting
or voted to approve such resolution.

To the extent provided by the Italian Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a meeting of Holders of the
Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil Code. The
Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meetings of Holders” will be in addition
to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under the caption “—Amendments and Waivers.” As
such and notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to
complying with the provisions described under this “—Meetings of Holders” must also comply with the
other provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 2419 of the Italian Civil Code, the individual rights of the
Holders of the Notes are not precluded, unless they are inconsistent with the resolutions of the meeting of
the Holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code.

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase
of the Notes on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of
the holders of the Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as
representative (rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414 bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the
“Security Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees securing
and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the
Notes all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to such
security interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, each holder of the Notes from
time to time, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of
U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
_Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the_
holders of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2418
of the Italian Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the holders of the

252


-----

Notes. If the Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the holders of the Notes, the
Noteholders’ Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its
registered office upon request by one or more holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors of the
Issuer. The Noteholders’ Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three financial years
but may be subsequently reappointed thereafter and shall have the powers and duties set out in Article
2418 of the Italian Civil Code.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any Parent Entity, or any
Subsidiaries or Affiliates of the Issuer, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or
any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice or has actual knowledge, the Trustee will perform only such duties as
are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice or has actual knowledge, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care
that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take
or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty. Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has
received, customary protection and indemnification.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Issuer, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires actual knowledge of a
conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes
insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of
a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses (including legal fees) Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published
on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In addition, for so long as any Notes
are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to
Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may instead be published in a leading newspaper of general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxembourger Wort) or if, in the opinion of the
Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in
Europe.

253


-----

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so
mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in
it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of,
a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it
from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such
purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out
herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro denominated restriction herein, the euro-equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated
in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF thereof upon their issuance. There can be no
assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
to admit the Notes on the Euro MTF will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on
obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

254


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the
Notes Guarantees and the Notes, the Issuer in the Indenture and each Guarantor in its respective
supplemental indenture will irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The provisions described under
“—Amendments and Waivers”, “—Meeting of Holders” and “—Security Representative and Noteholders’
_Representative” and the provisions of the Indenture concerning the meetings of Holders and the_
appointment of the Security Representative and the Noteholders’ Representative in respect of the Notes
will be subject to compliance with Italian law.

The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Transaction Security Documents will be
governed by the laws of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions,

the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (by merger or otherwise), during the Relevant Testing
Period or subsequent to the Relevant Testing Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed

270


-----

Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such
Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, or disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period.
If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of
such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for
such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer
(and may include cost savings and synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is
being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire Relevant
Testing Period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on
a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such
Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred
to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall
be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the Relevant Testing
Period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may
optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any specified Person for any period, the sum, without
duplication, of:

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”) under
the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global
Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the
accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream
Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) under
the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with, or
on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the
name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the
closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in
the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise in
accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture governing the Notes and any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under
the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be
entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery
of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of
interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical
delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered the
registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the nominee of the Common Depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests,
to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the BookEntry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive for definitive registered
Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) if:

   - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue a depositary
for the Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor;

   - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture (as
defined therein); or

295


-----

   - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an Event of Default under the Indenture (as
defined therein).

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current
procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all
owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is
not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar will be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered
office of the Registrar or as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a
Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new
Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be
issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a
denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued.
Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and
operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated
and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the
Trustee or its authenticating agent will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of
both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant
to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.
The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered
Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper
having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Payment of
principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at
the office of the Paying Agent in Dublin, Ireland.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such
Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
Common Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for a cancellation or, in the case of a
partial redemption, the Common Depositary will request the Registrar or Trustee to mark down, endorse

296


-----

and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note
as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of
such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are
to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts
on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair
and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest
and additional interest, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn,
make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with their respective procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made,
then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”, the Issuer will pay
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received after such deduction or
withholding will equal the net amounts that would have been otherwise received absent such withholding or
deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern
payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and
the Registrar will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee of the Common
Depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent the Registrar nor any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

   - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

   - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar, nor any of their respective
agents, will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses
or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection
with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax
consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book- Entry

297


-----

Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other
action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of
Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes,
and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules
and procedures may change from time to time. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive
Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global
Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on
the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”.

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor
of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the
U.S. Securities Act. Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the
offering of the Notes and the closing of the offering (the “40-day period”), Regulation S Book-Entry
Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold
interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall
not be permitted during such periods unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes
delivery in the form of Restricted Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act or (ii) otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global
Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, nor any of their
respective agents, are responsible for those operations or procedures.

298


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, and they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities
in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.
In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems will receive
distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market upon their issuance.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, will
have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the Issue Date against payment for value on the Issue
Date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle
in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems
are open for business.

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States.
U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery
of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business
day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently_
_applicable in the European Union, Italy and the United States and does not purport to address the tax_
_consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences_
_of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium paid_
_(if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, European Union, Italian or United States law as_
_in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may take_
_effect after such date, also on a retroactive basis. References in this section to holders of the Notes include the_
_beneficial owners of the Notes. Terms defined under each subsection related to European Union, Italian and_
_United States tax law below only have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The_
_statements regarding the Italian and United States laws and practices set forth below assume that the Notes will_
_be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

**Certain Italian tax considerations**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practice of the
Italian tax authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any
changes in law occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The
following is a summary only of the material Italian tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposal of the Notes for Italian resident and non-Italian resident beneficial owners, although it is not
intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. The following summary does not
purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision
to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences
applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may
be subject to special rules. Neither the Issuer nor any other entity belonging to the Group will update this
summary to reflect changes in law or in the interpretation thereof and, if any such change occurs, the
information in this summary could be superseded.

**_Tax treatment of interest_**

**_Italian-resident Noteholders_**

Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (“Decree No. 239”) sets forth the applicable regime
regarding the tax treatment of interest, premium and other income (including the difference between the
redemption amount and the issue price, hereinafter collectively referred to as “Interest”) deriving from
Notes falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) and similar securities (pursuant to Article 44 of
Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and supplemented (“Decree No. 917”)),
issued, inter alia, by:

(a) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a
multilateral trading platform of EU Member States or States party to the European Economic
Area Agreement (“EEA State”) allowing a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian
tax authorities as included in (i) the decree of the ministry of Economy and Finance of
September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended and supplemented or (ii) once effective, any other
decree that will be issued in the future under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239 (any of such
decrees, the “White List”); or

(b) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are not listed, issuing notes traded
(negoziati) upon their issuance on the aforementioned regulated markets or platforms; or

(c) if not traded on the aforementioned markets or multilateral trading platforms, when such notes
are subscribed for by, held by and transferred among “qualified investors” only as defined under
article 100 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998.

For these purposes, securities similar to bonds (titoli similari alle obbligazioni) are securities that
incorporate an unconditional obligation for the Issuer to actually pay, at maturity, an amount not lower
than their nominal/face value/principal (“valore nominale”) and that do not provide any right of direct or
indirect participation in, or control on, the management of the Issuer or of the business in connection with
which they are issued.

300


-----

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest relating to Notes issued by the Issuer that qualify as
obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni are subject to a tax, referred to as imposta sostitutiva (as
defined below), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or when payment thereof is obtained
by the holder on a sale of the Notes) where an Italian resident holder of Notes is the beneficial owner of
such Notes, and is:

(d) an individual holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial; or

(e) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice or similar
partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities or a professional
association; or

(f) a private or public entity (other than a company) or a trust not carrying out commercial activities
(other than an Italian undertaking for collective investment); or

(g) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation;

in any case, unless the Italian resident noteholder has entrusted the management of the financial
assets, including the Notes, to an authorized intermediary and has validly opted for the application of the
so-called risparmio gestito regime (the “Asset Management Option”) pursuant to Article 7 of Italian
Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended (“Decree No. 461”).

All the above categories are classed as “net recipients.”

Where the resident holders of the Notes described in (a) and (c) above are engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional
income tax. In such a case, Interest deriving from the Notes is subject to Italian ordinary income taxation
and the imposta sostitutiva may be deducted from the income taxation due by the taxpayer.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian
resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities
pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10,
1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes
are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that
meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016, as
subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Finance Act 2017”), Article 1 (211-215) of Law No. 145 of
December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Finance Act 2019”), or Article
13-bis of Law Decree No. 124 of October 26, 2019, converted into Law No. 157 of December 19, 2019, as
subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Law Decree No. 124”).

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the 26% imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, società di
intermediazione mobiliare (so-called “SIMs”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio,
stockbrokers and other qualified entities, identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance, which are
resident in Italy (“Intermediaries” and each an “Intermediary”) or by permanent establishments in Italy of
banks or intermediaries resident outside Italy or by organizations or companies non-resident in Italy,
acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the
Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance (which includes Euroclear and Clearstream) having
appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239. For the purposes of applying
imposta sostitutiva, Intermediaries or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries are
required to act in connection with the collection of Interest or, in the transfer or disposal of Notes,
including in their capacity as transferees. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a
transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results
in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are
deposited.

Payments of Interest in respect of Notes issued by the Issuer that fall within the definitions set out
above are not subject to the 26% imposta sostitutiva if made to beneficial owners who are:

(a) Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to
which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) Italian resident partnerships carrying out commercial activities (società in nome collettivo or
società in accomandita semplice);

(c) Italian resident open-ended or closed-ended collective investment funds, investment companies
with fixed capital (SICAFs) or investment companies with variable capital (SICAVs) established

301


-----

in Italy, Italian resident pension funds referred to in Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of
December 5, 2005 (“Decree No. 252”), Italian resident real estate investment funds and Italian
real estate closed-ended investment companies (“RE SICAFs”); and

(d) Italian residents holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial activity who
have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized
financial intermediary and have validly opted for the Asset Management Option.

Such categories are classed as “gross recipients”. To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the
Notes without the application of the 26% imposta sostitutiva, gross recipients must deposit the Notes
together with the coupons relating to such Notes in due time directly or indirectly with an Italian
authorized financial Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary).

Where the Notes and the relevant coupons are not deposited with an authorized Intermediary (or
permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary), imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld:

(a) by any Italian bank or any Italian intermediary paying Interest to the holders of the Notes,

(b) by the Issuer, and

(c) gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of
foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct any
imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due on their taxable income.

Interest accrued on the Notes is not subject to imposta sostitutiva and is included in the corporate
taxable income (and in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the holders of the Notes, also
in the net value of production for purpose of regional tax on productive activities, “IRAP”) of the holders
of the Notes who are Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent
establishments in Italy or foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected, subject to tax
in Italy in accordance with ordinary tax rules provided that the Notes together with the relevant coupons
are timely deposited with an Intermediary.

Italian resident individuals holding Notes not in connection with entrepreneurial activity who have
opted for the Asset Management Option are subject to a 26% annual substitute tax (the “Asset
**Management Tax”) on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year**
(which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). The Asset Management Tax is applied on
behalf of the taxpayer by the managing authorized intermediary.

Interest accrued on the Notes held by Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs is not
subject to the imposta sostitutiva—provided that (i) Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs and
SICAFs or their managers are subject to supervision of a regulatory authority and (ii) the Notes together
with the relevant coupons are timely deposited with an Intermediary—but is included in the aggregate
income of the Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs. The Italian collective investment
funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such result, but a withholding tax of 26% will
apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders (the
“Collective Investment Fund Substitute Tax”).

Where an Italian resident noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article
17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes together with the relevant
coupons are timely deposited with an Intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the
holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant
portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% substitute tax (the “Pension Fund
**Tax”) on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase**
would include Interest accrued on the Notes). Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a
minimum holding period), Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the
Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di
risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of the Finance Act
2017, Article 1 (211-215) of the Finance Act 2019 or Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 214.

Where a holder of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a RE SICAF to
which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended,
apply, Interest accrued on the Notes will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva, nor to any other income
tax in the hands of the real estate investment fund or the RE SICAF, provided that the Notes together
with the relevant coupons are timely deposited with an Intermediary. The income of the real estate fund or

302


-----

the SICAF is subject to tax in the hands of the unitholder on a tax transparency basis, depending on the
status and percentage of participation, or, upon distribution by the real estate fund, and/or redemption or
disposal of the units.

**_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_**

**_Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest in respect of Notes issued by the Issuer falling within the_**
**_definitions set out in “—Italian-resident Noteholders” above will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva at the rate of_**
**_26%, provided that:_**

(a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent
establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) such beneficial owners are resident, for tax purposes, in White List States; and

(c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant
implementation rules, as subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption from
imposta sostitutiva, are met or complied with in due time.

Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from imposta sostitutiva for payments of
Interest in respect of the Notes made to (i) international entities and organizations established in
accordance with international agreements ratified in Italy, (ii) “institutional investors,” whether or not
subject to tax, which are established in White List States (in relation to institutional investors subject to tax
the beneficial ownership requirement generally applies) and (iii) Central Banks or entities which manage,
inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of 26% imposta
sostitutiva, non-Italian resident investors indicated above must:

(a) deposit the Notes in due time together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or
indirectly with:

(i) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for
the bank or financial institution to be EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as
intermediary in the deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a
Second Level Bank (as defined below); or

(ii) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident
bank or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain
direct relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (the “Second Level Bank”). Organizations and companies that are
not resident of Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and
directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Italian Ministry of Economy and
Finance (which include Euroclear and Clearstream) are treated as Second Level Banks,
provided that they appoint an Italian representative (an Italian resident bank or SIM, or the
permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, or a central
depositary of financial instruments pursuant to Article 80 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of
February 24, 1998) for the purposes of the application of Decree No. 239. If a non-Italian
resident Noteholder deposits the Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be
treated both as a First Level Bank and a Second Level Bank; and

(b) file in due time with the First Level Bank or Second Level Bank (as the case may be) a
declaration (autocertificazione) stating, inter alia, that he or she is a resident, for tax purposes (or
established, for institutional investors), in a White List State. Such declaration
(autocertificazione) which must comply with the requirements set forth by an Italian Decree of
the Ministry for the Economy and Finance of December 12, 2001 (as amended and
supplemented), is valid until withdrawn or revoked and need not be submitted where a
certificate, declaration or other similar document meant for equivalent uses was previously
submitted to the same depository. The declaration (autocertificazione) is not required for
non-Italian resident investors that are international entities and organizations established in
accordance with international agreements ratified in Italy and Central Banks or entities which
manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state.

The imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at a rate of 26% on interest paid to Noteholders who do not
qualify for the foregoing exemption or do not timely and properly satisfy the requested conditions

303


-----

(including the procedures set forth under Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules). The
26% imposta sostitutiva may generally be reduced to 10% or reduced to zero under certain applicable
double tax treaties entered into by Italy, if more favorable, subject to timely filing of required
documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10,
2013.

**_Tax treatment of capital gains_**

_Italian-resident Noteholders_

Pursuant to Decree No. 461, a 26% capital gains tax (referred to as “imposta sostitutiva”) is applicable
to capital gains realized by (i) Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to which
the Notes are connected, (ii) non-commercial partnerships (societa` semplici) or (iii) non-commercial
private or public institutions, on any sale or transfer for consideration of the Notes or redemption thereof.

In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt—under certain conditions—
for any of the three regimes described below.

Under the so-called “tax declaration regime,” which is the standard regime for taxation of capital
gains realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to the extent that
they do not opt for the “risparmio amministrato” regime or the Asset Management Option, the 26%
imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains net of any
relevant incurred capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial
activities pursuant to all investment transactions carried out during any given tax year. The capital gains
realized in a year net of any relevant incurred capital losses must be detailed in the relevant annual tax
return to be filed with Italian tax authorities and imposta sostitutiva must be paid on such capital gains by
Italian resident individuals together with any balance income tax due for the relevant tax year. Capital
losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four
succeeding tax years. Alternatively, holders of the Notes who are Italian resident individuals not engaged
in entrepreneurial activities to which the Notes are connected, may elect to pay imposta sostitutiva
separately on capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes (“risparmio
_amministrato” regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:_

(a) the Notes being deposited with an Italian qualified intermediary (or permanent establishment in
Italy of a foreign intermediary); and

(b) an express election for the so called risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in due
time by the relevant holder of the Notes.

The intermediary is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains
realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes, as well as on capital gains realized as at
revocation of its mandate, net of any relevant incurred capital losses, and is required to pay the relevant
amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the holder of the Notes, deducting a corresponding
amount from proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes. Where a sale or transfer or redemption of
the Notes results in a capital loss, the intermediary is entitled to deduct such loss from gains of the same
kind subsequently realized on assets held by the holder of the Notes within the same relationship of
deposit in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio
_amministrato regime, any realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax_
return of the holders of the Notes.

Special rules apply if the holders of the Notes have entrusted the management of their financial assets
(including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary and have exercised the Asset Management Option. In
this case, capital gains on the Notes will not be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains.

In particular, under the Asset Management Option, any appreciation of the Notes, even if not
realized, will contribute to determine the annual accrued appreciation of the managed portfolio, subject to
26% Asset Management Tax. Any depreciation of the managed portfolio accrued at year end may be
carried forward against appreciation accrued in each of the four subsequent years. Under the Asset
Management Option the realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax
return of the holders of the Notes.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian
resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities
pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10,

304


-----

1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on capital gains on the
Notes if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a
lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of the Finance Act 2017,
Article 1 (211-215) of the Finance Act 2019 or Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124.

In the case of Notes held by investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs, capital gains on Notes contribute
to determine the increase in value of the managed assets of the funds, SICAVs or SICAFs accrued at the
end of each tax year. The investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such
increase, but the Collective Investment Fund Substitute Tax will apply, in certain circumstances, to
distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders.

Any capital gains realized by a holders of the Notes that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the
regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005), will not be
subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the
end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% Pension Fund Tax on the increase in value of the managed
assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes).
Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), capital gains in
respect of Notes realized upon sale, transfer or redemption by Italian pension fund may be excluded from
the taxable base of the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings
account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1
(100 114) of the Finance Act 2017, Article 1 (211-215) of the Finance Act 2019 or Article 13-bis of Law
Decree No. 124.

Where a holder of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a RE SICAF, to
which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended,
apply, capital gains realized will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the
hands of the real estate investment fund or the RE SICAF. The income of the real estate fund or the
RE SICAF is subject to tax in the hands of the unitholder on a tax transparency basis, depending on the
status and percentage of participation, or, upon distribution by the real estate fund or RE SICAF and/or
redemption or disposal of the units.

Any capital gains realized by Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent
establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are connected or Italian
resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, will be
included in their business income (and, in certain cases, may also be included in the taxable net value of
production for IRAP purposes), subject to tax in Italy according to the relevant ordinary tax rules.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

The 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains may in certain circumstances be payable on any capital
gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals and
corporations without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if
the Notes are held in Italy.

However any capital gains realized by non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected through the sale for consideration or redemption of the
Notes are exempt from taxation in Italy to the extent that the Notes are listed on a regulated market in
Italy or abroad, and in certain cases subject to timely filing of required documentation (in the form of a
declaration (autocertificazione) of non-residence in Italy) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or
permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited, even if
the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty.

Where the Notes are not listed on a regulated market in Italy or abroad:

(a) Pursuant to the provisions of Decree No. 461, non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes
with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected are exempt
from imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or
redemption of the Notes if they are resident for tax purposes in a White List State. Under these
circumstances, if non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes without a permanent
establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset
Management Option or are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from
Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they timely file with the authorized financial

305


-----

intermediary an appropriate declaration (autocertificazione) stating that they meet the
requirement indicated above. The same exemption applies in case the beneficial owners of the
Notes are (i) international entities or organizations established in accordance with international
agreements ratified by Italy; (ii) certain foreign institutional investors established in White List
States; or (iii) Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign
State.

(b) In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double taxation treaty
with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon sale or redemption of Notes are to be taxed
only in the country of tax residence of the recipient, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in
Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of Notes. Under
these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the
_risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that_
they timely file with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include,
inter alia, a statement from the competent tax authorities of the country of residence of the
non-Italian residents.

The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-resident
persons and entities in relation to Notes deposited for safekeeping or administration with Italian banks,
SIMs and other eligible entities, but non-resident holders of the Notes retain the right to waive this regime.
Such waiver may also be exercised by non-resident intermediaries in respect of safekeeping, administration
and deposit accounts held in their names in which third parties’ financial assets are held.

**_Certain reporting obligations for Italian-resident Noteholders_**

Pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 167 of June 28,1990, converted by Italian Law No. 227 of
August 4, 1990, as amended by Italian Law No. 97 of August 6, 2013 and subsequently amended by Italian
Law No. 50 of March 28, 2014 and Italian Law No. 225 of December 1st, 2016, individuals, non-profit
entities and certain partnerships (società semplici or similar partnerships in accordance with Article 5 of
Decree No. 917) resident in Italy who hold investments abroad or have financial activities abroad must, in
certain circumstances, disclose the aforesaid and related transactions to the Italian tax authorities in their
income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within
the same time as prescribed for the income tax return). The requirement applies also where the persons
above, being not the direct holder of the financial instruments, are the actual owner of the instrument
under the Italian money-laundering law.

Furthermore, the above reporting requirement is not required to comply, inter alia, with respect to
Notes deposited for management or administration with qualified Italian financial intermediaries, with
respect to contracts entered into through their intervention, upon condition that the items of income
derived from the Notes have been subject to tax by the same intermediaries.

**_Italian inheritance tax and gift tax_**

Pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 262 of October 3, 2006, converted into law with amendments by
Italian Law No. 286 of November 24, 2006, effective from November 29, 2006, and Italian Law No. 296 of
December 27, 2006, the transfers of any valuable assets (including the Notes) as a result of death or
donation (or other transfers for no consideration) and the creation of liens on such assets for a specific
purpose are taxed as follows:

(a) transfers in favor of spouses and direct descendants or direct ancestors are subject to an
inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 4% on the value of the inheritance or gift exceeding
€1,000,000 (per beneficiary);

(b) transfers in favor of brothers or sisters are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate
of 6% on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding €100,000 (per beneficiary);

(c) transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and relatives-in-law up to the third degree
are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 6% on the entire value of the
inheritance or the gift; and

(d) any other transfer is subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 8% on the entire
value of the inheritance or the gift.

306


-----

If the transfer is made in favor of persons with severe disabilities, the tax applies on the value
exceeding €1,500,000.

The transfer of financial instruments as a result of death is exempt from inheritance tax when such
financial instruments are included in a long-term saving account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo
termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100 114) of the Finance Act 2017, Article 1
(211-215) of the Finance Act 2019 or Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124.

Moreover, an anti-avoidance rule is provided for by Italian Law No. 383 of October 18, 2001 for any
gift of assets (such as the Notes) which, if sold for consideration, would give rise to capital gains, subject to
the imposta sostitutiva provided for by Decree No. 461. In particular, if the donee sells the Notes for
consideration within five years from the receipt thereof as a gift, the donee is required to pay the relevant
imposta sostitutiva on capital gains as if the gift was not made.

With respect to Notes listed on a regulated market, the value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is
the average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift
(including any accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax and gift tax
purposes is generally determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar features
or based on certain elements as presented in the Italian tax law.

Italian inheritance tax and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for bonds issued by
Italian resident companies.

**_Wealth tax—direct holding_**

According to Article 19 of Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, as amended by Article 1 par. 582 of
Italian Law No. 147 of December 27, 2013, and Article 9 of Italian Law No. 161 of October 30, 2014,
Italian resident individuals, non-commercial entities, non-commercial partnerships and similar institutions
holding financial assets—including the Notes—outside of the Italian territory are required to pay a wealth
tax at the rate of 0.2%. The maximum amount due is set at €14,000 for holders of the Notes other than
individuals.

The IVAFE applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year or—in the absence of a
market value—on the nominal value or redemption value, or in the case the face or redemption values
cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial assets held outside of the Italian territory.
Taxpayers are entitled to an Italian tax credit equivalent to the amount of wealth taxes paid in the State
where the financial assets are held (up to an amount equal to the IVAFE due).

**_Stamp taxes and duties—holding through financial intermediary_**

According to Article 13 par. 2-ter of the tariff Part I attached to Italian Presidential Decree No. 642 of
October 26,1972, as amended by Article 1 par. 581 of Italian Law No. 147 of December 27, 2013, a
proportional stamp duty applies on a yearly basis to the periodic reporting communications sent by
financial intermediaries to their clients in respect of any financial product and instrument, which may be
deposited with such financial intermediary in Italy. This stamp duty applies at the rate of 0.20% on the
market value or—in the absence of a market value—on the nominal value or the redemption amount or in
the case the nominal or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial
products and cannot exceed the amount of €14,000 for holders of the Notes that are not individuals. At any
rate, where no specific exemption applies, a minimum stamp tax of €34.20 is due on a yearly basis. Stamp
duty will apply on the Notes, both to Italian resident holder of the Notes and to non-Italian resident
holders of the Notes, to the extent that the Notes are held with an Italian based financial intermediary.

The statement is considered to be sent at least once a year, even for instruments for which is not
mandatory, nor the deposit, nor the release or the drafting of the statement. In case of reporting periods of
less than twelve months, the stamp duty is payable pro-rata.

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of
Economy on May 24, 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in the
regulations issued by the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time) of an entity that exercises in any
form a banking, financial or insurance activity within the Italian territory. Proportional stamp duty does
not apply to communications and reports that the Italian financial intermediaries send to investors who do
not qualify as “clients” according to the regulations issued by Bank of Italy. Communications and reports
sent to this type of investors are subject to the ordinary €2.00 stamp duty for each copy. Moreover, the
proportional stamp duty does not apply to communications sent to Pension Funds.

307


-----

**_Registration tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows: (i) public
deeds and notarized deeds (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate) executed in Italy are subject to fixed
registration tax at a rate of €200; (ii) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are subject to
registration tax at a rate of €200 only in the case of use or voluntary registration or occurrence of the
so-called enunciazione.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) under the
Indenture. Any Additional Notes will be considered fungible for Italian income tax purposes with the
applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture only if the conditions set forth in Article 11(2)
of Decree No. 239 are met. In particular, Article 11(2) of Decree No. 239 requires that (i) the issuance of
Additional Notes occurs within 12 months of the original issue of the initial Notes, and (ii) the spread
between (a) the issue price of the applicable series of the initial Notes and (b) the issue price of the
Additional Notes is less than one percent of the principal amount of the issuance multiplied by the number
of full years until the maturity date. If these requirements are not met, the Additional Notes will not be
considered fungible for Italian income tax purposes with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under
the Indenture.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the discussions below
under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”. This summary deals only with initial purchasers of Notes
at their “issue price” (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for cash to
persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) in the initial offering that will hold the Notes as capital
assets (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal
income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein
will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including
consequences under the unearned Medicare contribution tax, the alternative minimum tax, or the base
erosion and anti-abuse tax), and does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws. This summary
also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject
to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance
companies, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt
organizations, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark their securities to
market, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or
other pass through entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules,
corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, investors that will hold the Notes
as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
persons that purchase or sell the Notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, any holder of the Existing
Notes, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes
being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in section 451 of the Code),
investors that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States, investors
holding the Notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States, U.S.
citizens or lawful permanent residents living abroad or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or any
other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which
is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United
States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to
be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner or member in an entity or arrangement treated as
a partnership (or other pass through entity) for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will

308


-----

depend on the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partnership (or other pass through
entity). Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships (or other pass
through entities) for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S.
federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition
of Notes by the partnership (or other pass through entity).

This summary is based on the federal income tax laws of the United States, including the Code, as
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued thereunder,
published rulings and court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or
are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the
IRS or a court will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership or disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be
sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect
the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

**THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR**
**GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR**
**TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING,**
**OWNING, AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF**
**STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.**

**_Effect of IPO Debt Pushdown_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”, such change in the Issuer could result in a taxable
exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders would
recognize any gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange (although any such loss could be
disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the IPO pushdown is less than
the principal amount of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may
be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or with a greater amount of OID), in
which case the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes may be
different than what is described below. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the IPO pushdown.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances we may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or
deducted from payments on the Notes (see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make
additional payments in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (see “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Interest”). If any such payment is treated as a_
contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income
recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from
doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts or payments
does not result in the Notes being treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” under the applicable
Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the
issuance of the Notes, the possibility that such additional amounts or payments will have to be paid is a
remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a
U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during
which such U.S. Holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is
not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be
required to accrue interest income on its Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and any
otherwise applicable OID, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, some or all of any gain
recognized on the taxable disposition of the Notes, and to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss
with respect to such income. In the event a contingency occurs, the amount, timing and character of a
U.S. Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may be affected. U.S. Holders should consult

309


-----

their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

_General. Interest on a Note (including any non-U.S. taxes withheld from payments thereof and any_
additional amounts paid in respect of such withholding taxes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as
ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such U.S. Holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to the discussion below. Interest paid by the
Issuer on the Notes constitutes income from sources outside the United States.

_Foreign Currency Denominated Interest. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder_
will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an
interest payment denominated in euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method,
the amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the
interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder,
the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on
the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual
period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period
within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days
of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the
accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such
election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year
to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the
consent of the IRS.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Note) denominated in
euro, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated
into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of an accrual period and the amount
previously accrued during such accrual period (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is
in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or greater
than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 1/4 of 1% of the stated principal amount of the
Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date), then the
Notes will be considered to be issued with OID for United States federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to such excess.

If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer)
generally will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a
constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income.
The amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily
portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder
holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period”
(other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID
allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product of the
“adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to
maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the amount of stated interest allocable to the accrual
period. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of
its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Note’s issue price. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note
as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its issue price, increased by previously
accrued OID.

310


-----

OID will be income from sources outside the United States. The accrual of OID on a Note will be
computed in euros, and the amount of accrued OID determined for any accrual period then will be
translated into U.S. dollars, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting and in accordance with
either of the two alternative methods described above in “—Payments of Stated Interest”.

A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss)
when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts
attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such
payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described
above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts
of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual
periods first; and second, as receipts of principal.

**_Effect of Non-U.S. Withholding Taxes._**

As discussed above under “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian tax considerations—Tax
_treatment of interest—Non-Italian resident Noteholders”, under current law payments of interest on the_
Notes to foreign investors may be subject to Italian withholding taxes. The Issuer or any Guarantor is,
subject to certain exceptions, liable for the payment of additional amounts to U.S. Holders (see
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) so that U.S. Holders receive the same amounts they would
have received had no such withholding taxes been imposed. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S.
Holders would be treated as having received the amount of any such taxes withheld by the Issuer with
respect to a Note, and as then having paid over such withheld taxes to the relevant taxing authorities. As a
result, the amount of interest income included in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes by a
U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of interest may be greater than the amount of cash actually received
(or receivable) by the U.S. Holder from the Issuer with respect to the payment.

Subject to certain limitations, a U.S. Holder generally will be entitled to a credit against its U.S.
federal income tax liability, or a deduction in computing its U.S. federal taxable income, for non-U.S.
income taxes withheld by the Issuer. Interest income (and accrued OID) on a Note generally will constitute
“passive category income” for purposes of the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S.
federal income tax laws. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex. Prospective purchasers
should consult their tax advisers concerning the foreign tax credit implications of non-U.S. withholding
taxes.

**_Sale or Other Disposition of the Notes_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of a Note equal to
the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis of the Note, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency
on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount
realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate on
the date of disposition. The amount realized does not include the amount attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income. In
the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis
U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such
foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The
special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the
U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that
does not elect to determine the amount realized using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will
recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount
received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the
settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by such
U.S. Holder, increased by any previously accrued OID. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to purchase
a Note, the amount paid for the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase. In the case of a Note that is considered
to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it makes the special

311


-----

election described in the preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency purchase price at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
the Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount
of such Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or
expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency
purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect
to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar
value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder
disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the
spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or
loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid interest or accrued OID, if any,
which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original Issue
_Discount”. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note,_
a U.S. Holder will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal
amount and accrued and unpaid interest or accrued OID) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized
by such U.S. Holder on such disposition, and such gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source ordinary
income for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be
U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Any such capital gain or loss generally
will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year
on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including
individuals) are currently eligible for preferential tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of a Note generally will be U.S.
source. Therefore, a U.S. Holder may have insufficient foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credits
attributable to any foreign withholding tax imposed on the sale or disposition (see “—Certain Italian tax
considerations—Tax treatment of capital gains—Non-Italian resident Noteholders”). Prospective
purchasers should consult their tax advisers as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or other
disposition of Notes.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Payments of principal and interest (including the accrual of OID) on, and the proceeds of the sale or
other disposition of Notes paid by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the
IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Backup
withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an
accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable
certification requirements. Certain U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code, including provisions meant to require the reporting to
the IRS of certain tax shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions, giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum
amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any,
with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals and certain entities that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect to
such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets

312


-----

subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing
disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for
non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax on
interest income (and accrued OID) paid on a debt obligation if such interest income is treated as a
“foreign passthru payment” attributable to certain U.S. source payments. However, under proposed U.S.
Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations
are issued), such withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the
date that is two years after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign
passthru payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months
after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are
issued generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified more than six
months after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury
Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,
FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments
have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United
States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders should
consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event
any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will
be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations**

**_Payment by a Guarantor_**

If a guarantor of the Notes makes any payments in respect of (or that are classified as) interest on the
Notes it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such
relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other
exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for any
exemption from withholding.

If any Mexican Guarantor makes an interest payment directly to a non-Mexican holder of the Notes,
Mexican withholding taxes on such interest payment will apply.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE**
**SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes
Guarantees and the security interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency
law considerations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated or
organized. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all
of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or the Notes
Guarantees or security interests being provided for the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should
consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations.

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of Member States
of the European Union.

**_Regime Applicable to Insolvency Proceedings Opened after June 26, 2017_**

On June 5, 2015 Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published on the
Official Gazette of the European Union.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation will be applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after
June 26, 2017. Insolvency proceedings opened before June 26, 2017 will be subject to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation will apply to insolvency proceedings opened in respect
of a company whose center of main interests is located in a Member State (other than Denmark).

_Main insolvency proceedings_

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have
jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State
(other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “center of main
interests” (“COMI”) is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests
on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. The determination of where a debtor has its
COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States (other than Denmark) may
have differing and even conflicting views.

Article 3(1), paragraph 2, provides for a rebuttable presumption, whereby in the case of a company it
is assumed that its center of main interests is in the jurisdiction of the place of its registered office. In order
to prevent fraudulent or abusive forum shopping, such presumption only applies if the registered office has
not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request of the
opening of insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the presumption shall not apply and the court which shall
have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company will be the court of the Member
State (other than Denmark) within which the company had its registered office before moving it.

Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a
presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company’s central administration is located
in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive
assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests
is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration
when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where
the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority
of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s
operations.

This means that a company’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the
determination of where a company has its COMI depends on the facts and circumstances as at the time of
the request to open insolvency proceedings and on which the courts of the different Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views.

If the “center of main interests” of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast EU

314


-----

Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to
the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Preamble 10, Annex A has been extended to include
insolvency proceedings previously not falling within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation (such as,
with respect to Italian insolvency proceedings, accordi di ristrutturazione, procedure di composizione della
_crisi da sovraindebitamento del consumatore and liquidazione dei beni) in order to promote the rescue of_
economically viable but financially distressed businesses. The courts of all Member States (other than
Denmark) must recognize (subject to any public policy exception) the judgment of the court commencing
main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member
State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3
shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely
linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

_Secondary insolvency proceedings_

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are
to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may
be opened in other Member States. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another
Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency
proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other
Member State. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings
are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another
Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in
which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose the insolvency practitioner
must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law and
from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceeding was opened in the Member State
were the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the
undertaking is binding on the insolvent estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency
proceedings, it should refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately
protects the general interests of local creditors. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be
commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where
either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI
is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial
insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the
operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of
territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State
within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of
insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or
secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be
governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings of the debtor. Those exceptions include certain “safe harbors” which disapply the lex fori
_concursus of the relevant proceedings in respect of certain acts and rights. For example, rights in rem_
(which include the rights of creditors to take enforcement action against, and dispose of, the assets of the
company which is subject to the relevant insolvency proceedings) may not be affected by the company’s lex
fori concursus and are instead subject to the governing laws which apply to the relevant arrangement under
which the creditor obtains such rights.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency
proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision
may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

315

_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in
the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are
opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall
cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the
group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened
proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the
effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does
not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party,
provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

_Effects of the European Directive 2019/1023 on restructuring and insolvency_

On July 16, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June
20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on
measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of
debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (“EU Restructuring Directive”) entered into force.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States
concerning preventive restructurings and insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all Member States
on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of
insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their
quality. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the Member
States (i.e., minimum harmonization) but, at the same time, leaves a large degree of discretion regarding
the implementation of several features.

The Member States are required to pass national laws to implement the EU Restructuring Directive
(except for certain provisions which may be implemented at a later stage) by July 17, 2021. Member States
that encounter particular difficulties in implementing this Directive shall be able to benefit from an
extension of a maximum of one year of the implementation period subject to certain conditions being met.

The description of the current Member State domestic insolvency regimes must, therefore, be read
with the understanding that they might change, even substantially, following to the implementation – by
the relevant Member State – of the EU Restructuring Directive.

**_Applicability_**

In the event that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability
of the obligations of the Issuer.

The United Kingdom ceased to be an EU Member State on January 31, 2020. However, in accordance
with the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement entered into by the United Kingdom and the EU, the United
Kingdom entered an implementation period, during which it continued to be subject to EU law until
December 31, 2020 at 11.00 pm (the “IP Completion Day”). As of the IP Completion Day, the EU
Insolvency Regulation and the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation ceased (subject to the transitional
provisions in regulation 4 of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/146 in relation to
proceedings that were opened before the IP Completion Day) to be directly applicable to the United
Kingdom and the mutual recognition and coordination mechanisms in those Regulations no longer apply
between the United Kingdom and the EU and were not incorporated into law in the United Kingdom by
the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018 or associated statutory instruments.

**Italy**

**_Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law_**

_Corporate benefit_

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the
granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable
laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit,

316


-----

corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a
guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring,
financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest)
must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being
provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable
legislation and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any.
As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone
basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which
such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for down-stream
security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect
subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or
cross-stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the
direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under
the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted
security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive
some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an
up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies,
examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany
loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to
shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to
whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict
of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not
be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including
granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially
affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and
directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the
directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that
the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory
provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities
on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly
received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the security interest or guarantee
granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known
or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of
the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream
guarantees granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial
activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the
“Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial
intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail
the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Ministerial Decree No. 53 of
April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of
guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part
of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling
and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as
companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject
to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the
provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

_Financial assistance_

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any
liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as
the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful
for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to

317


-----

support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity
that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness
originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or
indirect parent company would also be a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in
breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act
in the best interest of the company.

_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is
issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum
amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures
(either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition,
as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate
benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not
exceed the financial capabilities of the Italian guarantor. It has been held, that such determination must be
proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the
assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

_Limitations to the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and
financial assistance, the maximum amount that the Italian guarantor and/or the security provider may be
required to pay in respect of its obligations as Italian guarantor and/or security provider under the
Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other
transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the
Italian guarantor’s or the security provider’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee and/or security
interests will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or such Italian guarantor
and/or security provider may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee or security interests.

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, corporate
benefit and financial assistance, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(a) a Notes Guarantee and security interest granted by a Italian guarantor and/or a security provider
shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any
intercompany loans made available from time to time to the Italian guarantor or security
provider (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil
Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly), in each case net of any proceeds already paid
pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received
upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or the security
provider; provided further that the Italian guarantor and/or the security provider shall not be
liable as a Italian guarantor and/ or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the
amount that the Italian guarantor or the security provider is entitled to set-off against its claims
of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by
the Italian guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest and/or as a result of
the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or security provider;

(b) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Italian guarantor or the security
provider, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will
not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes;

(c) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Italian
guarantor or the security provider will be at any time equal to the amount of interest accrued in
relation to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Italian guarantor
and/or security provider at that time;

(d) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the
Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests
(including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree
No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the obligations of a Italian guarantor and of a security provider

318


-----

under its Notes Guarantee and/or any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or the
security provider shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious
pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in
violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or Article 120 of
the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, respectively; and

(e) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to financial assistance (including article 2358 and/
or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of any Italian
guarantor and of a security provider under its Notes Guarantee and/or any security interests
granted by the Italian guarantor or the security provider shall not include and shall not extend
(directly or indirectly) to: any obligation of any obligor, as principal debtor or guarantor (for
principal, interest and/or any other amount), in respect of any amount the purpose or the actual
use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of such Italian guarantor or
security provider (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or the subscription of
any shares or quota of such Italian guarantor or security provider (or any of its direct or indirect
holding companies) (or to refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for
such purposes) including any related costs and expenses.

In any case, the maximum amount that the Italian guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its
obligations as Italian guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security
documents upon enforcement of the Collateral granted by the Italian guarantor (if any) will ratably concur
and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by the Italian guarantor to any guaranteed and/or
secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement
(including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the
avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the
security interests granted by the Italian guarantor (if any), the obligations of the Italian guarantor as
Italian guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and
any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be
considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of
the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security obligations of the
Italian guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the Italian guarantor’s credit support
as described above.

The proceeds of the enforcement of such guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed
amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes)
in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes,
as applicable, will be able to recover limited amounts under the Guarantees and security interests.

_Trust_

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the
security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of
the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be
entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no
guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and
guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in
the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor
are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public
registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that
the appointment of the Security Agent also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders
of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian
court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of

319


-----

enforcement are not secured by the security under the Transaction Security Documents and/or that the
_rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the_
holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of
the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the
appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court
may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is only granted in
favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the
Collateral and/ or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative
(rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and
the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly
parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share
certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee”, since there is no
established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and
enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted
over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the
parallel debt and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security
Agent, in its individual capacity acting in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of
the Notes, becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes.
However, the parallel debt procedure included in the Intercreditor Agreement, according to which the
security interests is also granted in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations
against the Issuer, which will be discharged to the extent the corresponding principal payment obligations
of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Notes are discharged, has not been tested in
Italian courts, and there is no assurance that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed
by Italian law, therefore, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, in no event will the “parallel
debt” provisions apply to any Transaction Security Document governed by Italian law.

_Italian Usury Laws_

If at any time the Issuer would be liable for the payment of remuneration of principal (including the
rate of interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs, but excluding tax costs) resulting in a breach of
Italian law on usury (Law No. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended from time to time) and any related
implementing regulations, then the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the remuneration of principal
shall be limited to the payment of remuneration of principal which is permitted under Italian law on usury
and any related implementing regulations. Indeed, Article 1815 of the Italian civil code provides that if the
remuneration exceeds the maximum rates permitted under the Italian law on usury, no remuneration is
due to the creditor.

_Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In
this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any
entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the
case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all
other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made
when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the
borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation
requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the
borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be
required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form”
and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form
of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

320


-----

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized
above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to
companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany
loans that are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian
courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian
subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the
obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations
towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or
note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior
only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note
granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to
meet its payment obligations under the Notes, as applicable.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany
loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes, as applicable to
recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or
security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

_Certain limitations on enforcement_

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement
process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two
primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s
assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of
businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees
and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential
challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or
avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or
claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
**period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions**
in an insolvency scenario, see “—Bankruptcy (fallimento)” above.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or
guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

   - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to
or affecting the rights of creditors;

   - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

   - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to
perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of
Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

  - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or
may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

   - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

321


-----

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter
in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such
opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the
application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement
or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for
the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian
Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such
interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the
proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors
cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security
interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets
is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in
which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the
absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and
extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal
interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure
proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to
the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date
(data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring
that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant
document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the
document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation
of mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

322


-----

   - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge;
and

   - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the
pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding
and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but
the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights
on the pledged quotas/shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an
action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter
enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in
order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil
Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee,
security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit.
An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to
the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

   - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

   - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if
the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in
the fraudulent design.

**_Insolvency laws_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other
jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency
process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security
interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with
which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain
reserved activities nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application when
public companies are involved.

Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and,
therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to
date in the Italian courts. To this extent, it shall be noted that Italian insolvency laws and regulations have
recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In
particular, the Italian Government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14
implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 containing the scheme of a
new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative
**Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency**
matters (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The
Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019, No. 38—Suppl. Ordinario
No. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term
“bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings
(fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”;
(iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access
the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) the adoption
of definition of debtor’s COMI (Centre of Main Interest) as provided for in the new set of rules
concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert
and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving
large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the
general effectiveness of the reform.

The Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by Legislative Decree No. 147 of
October 26, 2020. Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the

323


-----

Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law
Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (“Liquidity Decree”), converted into law on June 5, 2020 No. 40. Until that
date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as in force
before. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the
existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the
near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. In light of the foregoing, and for the sake of
clarity, the following paragraphs will only focus on the Italian insolvency laws and regulations already
applicable and into force as of the date hereof (and will not take into account, therefore, the provisions of
the Insolvency Code which will enter into force beginning on September 1, 2021). Moreover, by way of a
decree dated as of April 22, 2021, the Italian Minister of Justice, Ms. Marta Cartabia, appointed a panel of
experts for the purposes of working on possible additional amendments to the Code of Business Crisis and
Insolvency including in relation to, inter alia (i) a possible additional postponement of the date of entry
into force of certain provisions of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency; (ii) possible adjustments in
light of EU Insolvency Directive (EU) 2019/1023; (iii) the current and persisting COVID-19 pandemic
emergency. According to the above-mentioned decree of the Minister of Justice, the panel of experts shall
revert with its proposal of amendments by June 10, 2021.

In addition to the above, it should be noted that the most recent reforms that have been implemented
by the Italian Government on the Italian Bankruptcy Law are: (i) the reform approved on June 27, 2015
through a law-decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the
“Decree 83/2015”), which entered into force in June 27, 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta
Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by the Italian Law No. 132/2015 effective August 21, 2015 (the
date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) (“Law 132”); and (ii) the amendments implemented by
means of adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016 (converted into law by Italian Law No. 119
of June 30, 2016) and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect
the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the
“Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment.

These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian
Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than
liquidation focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing
pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/
or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its
obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary, status of insolvency in
order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general,
financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which
may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the
event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for
companies in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and for insolvent companies.

_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for
the debtor and because informal arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may
be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence
of the company.

_Out-of-court restructuring plans (Piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento
_attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of_
their financial condition. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the
restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. The
expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements
set forth, among the others, by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case
of misrepresentation or false certification.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable; however, it is arguable that they may be
adopted to liquidate and dismiss the business of the company and they shall provide for the restructuring
of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike
in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court
restructuring plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or
precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these
plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or the security
interests created as implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions: (i) are not
subject to bankruptcy claw-back action; and (ii) are exempted from potential application of certain
criminal sanctions (pursuant to Article 217-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Neither ratification by the
court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’
Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of
bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a
debt restructuring agreement. Since the restructuring plan is not subject to any court approval or judicial
review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of
subsequent bankruptcy, if the competent court were to assess that the restructuring plan was not feasible at
the time it was certified by the independent expert.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi_
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt
restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval. An independent expert appointed by the debtor
must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that
the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied
within a 120-day term from: (a) the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts
which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione)
of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in
case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the
approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court.

Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, only a debtor who is insolvent or in a
situation of “financial distress” can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of
the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication.
Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any
conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest
(unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debt.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, to the court by the debtor while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the
above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such
moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of
publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the
date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant
documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, creditors and other
interested parties may file and opposition to the agreement and the court assesses whether the conditions
for granting the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement
action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of
the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and
the assessment by the expert must be deposited.

325


-----

Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in
relation to the proceeding for the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt-restructuring agreements under
Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law already pending as of February 23, 2020, that the debtor
which has already been granted such extension by the court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request
for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against
it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary
to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19
epidemiological emergency. The court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if
appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable
grounds (concreti e giustificati motivi).

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect
of the moratorium.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of
the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of
the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain
refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring
agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication
of the agreement in the Companies’ Register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will
validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication in the
Companies’ Register.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced certain new provisions easing the
requirements with respect to financial creditors with respect to the debt restructuring agreements.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the
Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of
their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of
financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and
ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same
category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of
dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering
and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them
in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating
financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down
creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of
the classes of creditors.

Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and
financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the
non-participating financial creditors, provided that (a) they have been informed of the ongoing
negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (b) an
independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, third paragraph, letter (d) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-participating financial creditors have legal status and
economic interest similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the
moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring
operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and
the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it
within 30 days of receipt of the application.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182-septies of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors the
performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility
to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of
non-financial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within
120 days if not participating to a scheme.

326


-----

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor
pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition
with creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing
granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing and unless the lender has become a
shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of the Supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors). Financing
granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it
is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court
at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement. Same provisions apply
to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount but unless the lender has become a
shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court,
pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy
arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur new
pre-deductible indebtedness subject to authorization by the court and if an expert certifies that such
financing is functional to the overall restructuring process, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem
securities (“garanzie reali”), provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall
financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares the aim of the new financial
indebtedness results in a better satisfaction of the creditors; and (iii) pay debts deriving from the supply of
services or goods, already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential
for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition,
according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned
authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending
the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor
to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile) and urgent indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent
financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization,
is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required
funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the
company. Such authorization request can also be filed in relation to the maintaining short-term facilities
(linee di credito autoliquidanti) already in place as of the filing date.

_Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” has the option to make a
composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness
and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy
proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the
following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million
for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount
exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness
(including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition
with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an
independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the
business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then
published in the company’s register by the registry of the court. From the date of such publication to the

327


-----

date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by
the creditors (whose claims arose before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are
stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the
creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests
(unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which
the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such
pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for, inter alia: (i) the
restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it
will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with
creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article
186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting
to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible
into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of
the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into
classes and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal
may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law
No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its
financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to
the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal
and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the
date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days,
where there are reasonable grounds (giustificati motivi) for such extension.

Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in
relation to concordato preventivo proceedings already pending as of February 23, 2020, that the debtor
which has already been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request
for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against
it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary
to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19
epidemiological emergency. The Court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if
appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable
grounds (concreti e giustificati motivi).

In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt
restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts
such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview
the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims,
declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court,
which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set
forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory
provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by creditors referred to in
respect of concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called
_concordato in bianco)._

The debtor company cannot file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two
years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for
the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating
to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing
of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis,
until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the
company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.
Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the
relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the

328


-----

activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the
application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if
appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition
with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and
(ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent
they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the
_concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) and new super senior indebtedness_
authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the
moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the
filing of the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) pursuant to Article 161 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as
recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as supersenior (so called pre-deducibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts,
payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo proposal may provide, inter alia, that (i) the debtor’s company’s business
continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or
more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated
(concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the plan and the petition for the concordato
_preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the_
continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be
necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is
conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such proposal was not
implemented.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others,
the disposal of those assets that are not functional to the continuation of the business. The concordato
_preventivo plan and proposal may also provide for, inter alia, a proposed tax settlement for the partial or_
deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls_
a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be
managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial
officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The
debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization,
while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the
interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to
Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent
court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non
_compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above_
provision (for example, employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate
preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and
real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the
competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge
(giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request,
the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just
once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the
damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be treated as a
receivable preceding the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable
vote of: (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, in the event
that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, also by (b) the majority of the classes. The

329


-----

pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly
voted in favor of the proposal. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights
in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via e-mail) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the
creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have not exercised their voting right will be deemed
not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holders of the Notes in the
concordato proceeding, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the
Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and
majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts.
Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of the concordato preventivo unless and, to the
extent, they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full
satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent
expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The
court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more
classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the
interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other
solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the
creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class,
entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant
creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than
would otherwise be the case. The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by
the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza
_obbligatorie) when their accession is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in_
article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and when, also on the basis of the result of the report of the
independent expert referred to in article 161, third paragraph of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the proposal
to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to the liquidation alternative.

Article 163 paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for the possibility for creditors
(except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding
at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente)
to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain
conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure the recovery
of at least: (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement
proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti
_chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going_
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a prebankruptcy
composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a
pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such
assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid
in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement
proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may
grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate,
including the power to take all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third
party, the court opens a competitive bidding process. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the
court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato
_preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order._

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of
the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the
company bankrupt.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines
for the fulfillment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di

330


-----

_ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. Moreover,_
Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree also provides for: (i) upon certain circumstances, the possibility to
request a deadline to the Court in order to file a new plan and new proposal to creditors, in order to
supersede the previous ones; (ii) in relation to petition for a concordato preventivo and/or a debt
restructuring agreement under article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law filed up until December 31,
2021, the right of the debtor to file, within December 31, 2021, a deed of renunciation (atto di rinuncia)
whereby it declares that it has prepared and published in the competent companies’ register a
reorganization plan under article 67, third paragraph of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and provides evidence
of the publication thereof.

_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the
judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed when a debtor is insolvent by the debtor, any of its creditors
and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs
when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due.

Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable
only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met the
company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of
the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding
€0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts
not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

   - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file
claims within a defined period.

   - under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce the security interests granted in relation
to their claims as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out
of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject
to any relevant expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu
with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only
with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the
creditor’s committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant
timing in his or her decision;

   - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare);

   - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors; and

   - any act (including payments, pledges and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor (other than
those made through the receiver) after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of
time) the declaration of bankruptcy, becomes (or could become, if made before), ineffective against
creditors; and

   - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file
a written petition requiring the Court to give the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) a deadline of
no more than 60 days scheduled; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the
agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the bankruptcy receiver having
replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general
rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations
have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian
Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative

331


-----

of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of
creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights.
The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the
debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a
consequence the timing for the liquidation of the debtor’s assets is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law
provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs
associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the company,
Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Such priority
of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence, it is untested and it is
unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual
arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with
the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure
creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated.

   - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare)

Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition
proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties
starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to
file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two
years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the
extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive
full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an
independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected
by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby
proposing different treatments among the classes) and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any
manner. According to Article 124, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the petition may
provide that secured claims are paid only in part., to the extent that the plan provides for the
satisfaction in proportion to that which is possible in the event of winding-up, having regard to
the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption (causa di
_prelazione) exists, indicated in the sworn report of a professional meeting the requirements set_
out in art. 67, third paragraph, letter d) designated by the court. The treatment established for
each class may not have the effect of altering the order of the legitimate causes of pre-emption
(cause di prelazione).

The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by
value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required.

   - Statutory priorities

The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different
from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions.
Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according
to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by
proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on
equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments
such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be
enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the
priorities provided by law).

In particular, Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation
shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre-deductible” (i.e.
super senior) claims (including, inter alia claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as
costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of
secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the
highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential
creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and
claims for employee wages. The remaining priority of claims are, in order of priority, those
related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances,

332


-----

but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori
_pignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (creditori chirografari). The law creates a hierarchy of_
claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire
bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

  - Avoidance powers in insolvency

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under
Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of
security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance
provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and
transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are
normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the
rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for
a claw-back period of up to either one year or six months in (noting that in the context of extraordinary
administration procedures in relation to certain transactions, the claw-back period, can be extended to five
and three years respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by
operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court
commissioner.

(a) Acts ineffective by operation of law

(i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all
transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered
into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any
asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration
(trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait until the ineffectiveness
of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the
registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and

(ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the
day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if
made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

(b) Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner

(i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may
be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the above
referenced Italian Royal Decree and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party
proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time
the transaction was entered into:

(I) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when
the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds
25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(II) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor, in cash or by
other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

(III) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at
the time the new security was granted; and

(IV) pledges and mortgages, granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen
due at the time the new security was granted.

(ii) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other
period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the

333


-----

bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was
insolvent:

(I) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions
entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

(II) granting of security interest simultaneously created for debts incurred in the six
months prior to the insolvency declaration.

(iii) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(I) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to
market practice;

(II) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently
reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

(III) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the
Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a
residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the
purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that
is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the
date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the
investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(IV) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests
granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(V) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of a
sanctioned “concordato preventivo ” or a sanctioned “accordo di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti”;_

(VI) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants
concerning work carried out by them;

(VII) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with
respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the
bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria
_ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor_
may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such
creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was
aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was
originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of
prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a
third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to
the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). Law
132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the
aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors.

In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without
previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the
extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or
creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale—“family trust”). In case of
gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action also can be carried out by the creditor against the third party
purchaser.

_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese_
_in stato di insolvenza)_

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure”. To be eligible,

334


-----

companies must be insolvent, although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects have employed at
least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts
equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income
deriving from sales and services during its last financial year.

The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public
prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and
creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Extraordinary administration
procedures involve two main phases—an administrative phase and a judicial phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and
whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers
(commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale
or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an
opinion from the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide
whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial
condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase
begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The
plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by
the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial
recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a
composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry.

The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan;
however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. If the Disposal Plan is approved,
the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions according to the avoidance provisions set
forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such as those that could be declared ineffective at the
request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among companies belonging to the same
group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years.

_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_
_insolvenza)_

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of 23 December 2003, as converted into
Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano
procedure”. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same
provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For
example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the
court commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis,
have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of
debt. The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s
request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether
the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage
the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit
a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must
be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or
Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open
bankruptcy proceedings.

Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can
also initiate claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material
benefit for the creditors.

_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for
certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies,

335


-----

insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up
pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the
private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity
is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the
industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the
relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in
respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations
of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator
(commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a
steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the
bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative
authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely
the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures.

The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’
claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.

_Interim financing_

The Decree 83/2015, as amended and converted into law by Law 132/2015, by means of the already
described Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced the possibility for debtors to
also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade
receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s
approval of a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case
of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and through an accelerated review process by
the relevant court, upon, among others, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently
needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage.
The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with
the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors.

_Hardening period/claw-back and fraudulent transfer_

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant Guarantor and/or security provider enters into
insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the
Collateral and the Notes Guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors of such Guarantor under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian
Bankruptcy Law as described above. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the
Italian Guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Transaction Security
Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent
estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Transaction
Security Documents. In certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the
debtor are declared ineffective in accordance with the claw-back provisions set forth in the Italian Civil
Code as described above. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Bankruptcy (fallimento)”

In addition, as noted above, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which
replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within
the European Union.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter
_alia, on insolvency matters to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19_
pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis
before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings
already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic. Among such legislative measures, on April 8, 2020, the Italian Government enacted the
Liquidity Decree, which provides businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with a package of
financial assistance designed to help Italian businesses survive the dramatic short term effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and which has been converted into law on June 4, 2020.

336


-----

The Liquidity Decree (as amended, supplemented and replaced, as the case may be, from time to
time) contains measures to relieve enterprises from certain obligations or procedures that could trigger
adverse effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions. Most of such measures
were in place in the course of 2020 and no longer apply in 2021. However, some other measures are still
currently in place and shall therefore be considered.

One set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/
pre-insolvency scenarios. These measures provide, inter alia, that the rules requiring the recapitalization
(or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have
substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended
on December 31, 2020. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree
subsequently replaced by Article 1, par. 266 of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended to address
the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies
push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company
into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a
result of the delay in complying with such obligations.

**Australia**

The Notes will be guaranteed by Guala Closures Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and Guala Closures
Australia Pty Ltd, each being a company incorporated under the laws of Australia (together, the
“Australian Guarantors”). The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will also be secured by registered security
interests (together, the “Australian Collateral”) over the share capital of each of the Australian
Guarantors.

_Secured transactions law_

Australian Secured Transactions Law was substantially rewritten in early 2012, with the coming into
operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (the “PPSA”). The PPSA introduced a new
national register of security interests in Australia, as well as a system of priority and other provisions which
affect most types of collateral (other than land).

Under the PPSA, a security interest will only be fully effective if it is properly documented and
perfected. If it is not perfected, the secured party will be exposed to various risks including that its security
interest could rank behind other security interests in a priority dispute, be extinguished entirely (for
example, if the grantor transfers the collateral to another person) or could “vest” upon the administration
or liquidation of the grantor company, which has the effect of avoiding the security interest.

The most common method of perfecting a security interest is by registering a financing statement on
the Personal Property Securities Register (the “PPS Register”). Security interests can also be perfected,
for some types of collateral, by possession or control. If a security interest that is provided for by a
Transaction Security Document is to be perfected only by registration, the Security Agent will need to
register a financing statement on the PPS Register within 20 business days after that Transaction Security
Document comes into force, otherwise the security interest will be void if the grantor enters into voluntary
administration or liquidation within six months (noting that this will not be the case if the grantor enters
into other forms of insolvency proceedings, such as a receivership or a creditors’ scheme of arrangement).

A security interest will not necessarily defeat other security interests just because it was perfected first.
For example, a security interest that is perfected by control will usually have priority over all other security
interests, even ones which were perfected (for example, by registration) earlier. The PPSA also gives a
super priority to purchase money security interests (“PMSI”). In most cases, a PMSI will have priority over
other security interests even if the other security interests were perfected first (unless the other security
interest is perfected by control).

If a security interest is over “circulating assets” (such as funds in bank accounts (other than term
deposits), inventory, most accounts (for example, many receivables) and negotiable instruments), then it
may also rank behind some statutorily preferred claims (such as employee entitlements and the costs and
expenses of certain insolvency proceedings including an administrator of the grantor company) in an
insolvency proceeding.

337


-----

The ability to enforce the Australian Collateral may be constrained by Chapter 4 of the PPSA. The
enforceability of the Australian Collateral may also be subject to general law and statutory duties,
obligations and limitations. For example:

  - an Australian Guarantor may be able to redeem the corresponding secured property by tender of
payment in full of the obligations secured, at any time before the property is sold;

   - the secured party may need to exercise its power of sale in good faith and in a manner that is not
reckless, harsh or unconscionable, and will need to take reasonable care to sell the property for its
market value or, if it does not have a market value, the best price that is reasonably obtainable;

   - if the secured party is in possession of the secured property, it may need to account to the
corresponding Australian Guarantor for any excess, over the secured money, of rents and profits
received;

   - the Australian Collateral may be set aside in respect of any secured property which is confiscated by
a Government Agency under laws relating to the proceeds of criminal activities, however this is not
likely to occur unless the security interest is itself derived from criminal activity;

   - the exercise of a power of sale under the Australian Collateral may be subject to notice provisions
and other requirements imposed by statute in the relevant jurisdiction where the collateral;

   - a court may grant relief against the consequences of default if the default is subsequently remedied
or an undertaking to remedy it is given to the court; and

   - the document may not be admissible in evidence before a court if any necessary stamp duty has not
been paid.

The ability of a secured party to enforce the Australian Collateral may be affected if the relevant
Australian Guarantor enters into administration, particularly if the security granted by the Australian
Guarantor is not over all or substantially all of its property (including for this purpose all PPSA retention
of title property as defined in section 51F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Corporations Act”).
The ability of a secured party to enforce the Australian Collateral may also by affected by the operation of
the ipso facto regime which applies to certain categories of contracts, agreements, arrangements entered
into, and to certain categories of rights arising, on or after 1 July 2018, in accordance with sections 415D,
434J, 451E and 454N of the Corporations Act (as applicable) by way of the Treasury Laws Amendment
(2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Act 2017 (Cth) (“Ipso Facto Regime”) (see further below).

_Notes Guarantees and Australian Collateral_

The validity, enforceability and efficacy of the Notes Guarantee and the Australian Collateral
(security) to be granted by each of the Australian Guarantors will be affected in various circumstances
under Australian law, notwithstanding that the Notes Guarantees are to be governed by the laws of the
State of New York, including, without limitation, if:

   - in granting a Notes Guarantee or security, the directors of the Australian Guarantors did not
exercise their powers in good faith in the best interests, and for the benefit, of the relevant
Guarantor;

   - the granting of a Notes Guarantee or security breaches section 260A of the Corporations Act,
which prohibits the giving of financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of shares in an
Australian company or one of its holding companies, subject to a limited number of statutory
exceptions, including where shareholder approval for the financial assistance transaction has been
obtained. When a company giving financial assistance has an ultimate Australian registered holding
company, whether listed or not, immediately after the relevant acquisition occurs, shareholder
approval will also be required from that company;

  - any payment or proposed payment under the Notes Guarantee or security would breach laws and
regulations in Australia which prohibit or restrict transactions with persons and entities considered
to be associated with terrorism and payments to, or transactions in relation to, a person or entity
against whom the Commonwealth of Australia has imposed economic, political or other
international sanctions; and

  - the Notes Guarantee or security can be voided, or payments made under the guarantee can be
recovered, on the application to Court by a liquidator of the company (see below).

Enforcement may also be limited by statutes of limitation or by general law doctrines or statutory
relief in relation to such matters as fraud, misrepresentation, duress, or unconscionable conduct,
frustration, estoppel, waiver or penalties.

338


-----

For the reasons that follow, if the entry into the Notes Guarantees or the Australian Collateral
constitutes a voidable transaction under Part 5.7B of the Corporations Act, noteholders could be required
to disgorge payments made by the Australian Guarantors in an insolvency proceeding.

A liquidator is able to challenge certain transactions into which the company has entered. In
particular, the Corporations Act empowers a liquidator to apply to court to void an “uncommercial
transaction” (as defined below) entered into at a time when the company was insolvent, or an
uncommercial transaction which causes (whether wholly or in connection with other factors) the company
to become insolvent, which uncommercial transaction was entered into: (i) within the preceding two years;
(ii) within the preceding four years if the transaction involved a related entity of the company; or
(iii) within the preceding ten years if the purpose of the transaction was to defeat, delay or interfere with
the rights of creditors on a winding-up of the company. Uncommercial transactions are those which a
reasonable person in the company’s position would not have entered into having regard to any relevant
matter, including the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction, the detriment to the
company of doing so and the benefits to other parties of entering into the transaction.

In addition, a liquidator is able to challenge a transaction (including payments made under a
guarantee or the granting of a security) entered into at a time when the company was insolvent (or which
causes, whether wholly or in connection with other factors, the company to become insolvent) which
results in a creditor receiving from the company in respect of an unsecured debt more than the creditor
would receive from the company if the transaction was set aside and the creditor was to prove for the debt
in the winding-up of the company, and the transaction was entered into: (i) within the preceding six
months; (ii) within the preceding four years if the transaction involved a related entity of the company; and
(iii) within the preceding ten years if the purpose of the transaction was to defeat, delay or interfere with
the rights of creditors on a winding-up of the company.

Further, upon liquidation, a circulating security interest, being a security interest that attaches to
circulating assets (as to which, see above), that was granted within six months of the commencement of the
liquidation, is void against the liquidator, except so far as the security secures, among other things,
(A) advances of new money to the grantor company, (B) a liability under a guarantee or other obligation
undertaken at or after the time of the grant of security on behalf of or for the benefit of the grantor
company, or (C) an amount payable for new property or services provided to the company. This arises
under section 588FJ of the Corporations Act. The matter of what constitutes the grant of security on
behalf of or for the benefit of the company granting the security, for the purposes of this provision, was
considered in the case Cuthbertson & Richards Sawmills Pty Ltd v Thomas (1999) 30 ACSR 504.
Section 588FJ does not apply where the grantor company was solvent immediately after the grant of the
security.

Where a liquidator successfully challenges a transaction such as a guarantee and avoids that
transaction, then this can prevent the enforcement of the security interest and any money paid or received
under that transaction can become the subject of a court order for repayment.

_Insolvency Proceedings_

There are four principal corporate insolvency processes in Australia: administration (sometimes
referred to as voluntary administration); deed of company arrangement; liquidation (winding-up); and
receivership. In addition, there is a fifth, lesser-used regime: creditors’ schemes of arrangement.

Pursuant to section 435A of the Corporations Act, the object of administration is to maximize the
chances of the company or its business continuing in existence or, if it is not possible for the company or its
business to continue in existence, is to result in a better return for the company’s creditors and members
than would result from an immediate winding-up of the company.

Administration is only intended to last for a short period; however, in practice, the period is typically
extended by Court order. For complex matters (including those with cross border elements), extensions of
up to, and at times more than, 12 months are not uncommon. During this period, the administrator takes
control of the company, assesses its situation and the options available to it, and reports to creditors his or
her opinion on which of those options should be followed. The options in question are either liquidation,
deed of company arrangement or for the administration to end and for the company to return to the
control of its directors. To permit the administrator the opportunity to do this, there is a moratorium on
the enforcement of creditors’ claims (including security interests) and actions against the company and its
property (subject to certain exceptions, such as where a lender which holds a security interest over the

339


-----

whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets has enforced the security interest before the
administration begins or enforces the security interest during the first 13 business days of commencement
of the administration).

A deed of company arrangement is an agreement binding on the company and its creditors (and
sometimes others) in the nature of a compromise. By force of the Corporations Act, the agreement is one
which will bind even those unsecured creditors who do not vote in favor of it, provided a simple majority
(by both number and value of claims) votes in favor. Creditors holding security interests are not bound by a
deed of company arrangement if they do not vote for it, unless the Court orders differently (which is rare).

The purpose of a liquidation is to enable the realization of all of a company’s assets and the
distribution of the proceeds of sale of those assets among the company’s creditors and (if there is a surplus
after paying creditors) members. Generally speaking, to the extent that their security is sufficient, secured
creditors stand outside the liquidation and therefore do not have to prove for their debts. They are
generally entitled to sell the assets subject to their security or have them sold and to receive the proceeds
(subject to the rights of any prior security holders).

Receivers are typically appointed by a person to whom the company has granted a security interest.
Their appointment and powers are usually governed by the terms of the security agreement under which
they are appointed. The receiver’s principal task is to realize the assets subject to the security interest(s)
and pay the proceeds to the secured party. Receivership is a regime implemented for the benefit of the
secured creditor which appoints the receiver; whereas both administration and liquidation are regimes
aimed at securing the best outcome for all the company’s creditors as a body. Where a company grants
security over an asset, the proceeds of enforcement must generally be remitted to the secured party.

One exception to this is that where assets are subject to a security interest over circulating assets, the
receiver must pay or provide for priority payments from their proceeds before accounting to the secured
party. Priority payments are those listed in section 433(3) of the Corporations Act and include liabilities in
respect of certain insurance policies, auditors’ fees and employees’ wages and superannuation and certain
other employee entitlements, and the amount owing to the administrator on account of his or her fees,
costs and expenses. In a liquidation scenario, unpaid employee entitlements can be met by the Australian
Commonwealth Government in certain circumstances, which is then subrogated to those employees’ rights
in the liquidation.

A scheme of arrangement is a court-sanctioned arrangement or compromise, proposed by the relevant
company and voted on by the creditors or members (or a class or classes of them) (as applicable) of the
relevant company (“Scheme Participants”), which binds the company and the Scheme Participants even
though a dissentient minority of the Scheme Participants may oppose it.

On January 1, 2021, the small business ‘debtor in possession’ restructuring regime was introduced in
Australia. The regime is intended to provide eligible Australian incorporated small businesses with access to
a ‘debtor in possession’ restructuring process in which a restructuring plan can be proposed to deal with
creditor claims. The process is available to companies which meet the eligibility criteria, the most significant
of which is that the company’s liabilities are less than AUD$1 million, including secured and related-party
debt, but excluding employee entitlements. The Australian Guarantors are highly unlikely to meet the
eligibility criteria, noting that the face-value of the Notes alone is well in excess of AUD$1 million.

_Ipso Facto Regime_

The Ipso Facto Regime is designed to protect and preserve an affected party’s contractual assets while
it undergoes a formal financial restructuring procedure under the Corporations Act. The Ipso Facto
Regime provides that the exercise of express rights to terminate, accelerate or otherwise take action under
contracts, agreements or arrangements by reason of an affected party: (1) entering into a scheme of
arrangement with creditors (or announcing an intention to do so); (2) having a receiver or controller
appointed to all or substantially all of its assets; (3) entering into voluntary administration; or, (4) entering
into restructuring pursuant to Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act (together, “Restructuring Procedures”)
are stayed for the life of the relevant Restructuring Procedure. The Ipso Facto Regime also restricts
enforcement rights that arise by reason of the “financial condition” of a party subject to a Restructuring
Procedure and the exercise of rights for any reason that is in substance contrary to the matters provided for
in the Ipso Facto Regime.

Accordingly, the Notes Guarantees and the Australian Collateral will not be able to be enforced for the
reason that an Australian Guarantor has entered into a Restructuring Procedure while that Restructuring
Procedure remains on foot. However, the stay on the exercise of rights while a Restructuring Procedure is on
foot does not apply where the relevant right is exercisable for a reason other than the existence or

340


-----

commencement of a Restructuring Procedure (or related financial condition), such as a payment default.
Also note that the Ipso Facto Regime will not operate to restrict the right of a secured party who holds a
security interest over all or substantially all of a company’s assets to appoint a receiver or controller.

**Mexico**

_Personal Guarantees under Mexican Law_

Under Mexican law, there are no limitations for Mexican companies to guarantee third-party
obligations, including parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent permitted by its corporate by-laws and
authorized by its competent corporate bodies if necessary pursuant to its corporate by-laws. Mexican law
provides that contractual obligations such as those assumed by the Guarantors of Mexican nationality (each,
a “Mexican Guarantor,” and together, “Mexican Guarantors”) are considered to be ancillary obligations
(obligaciones accesorias) to the principal obligations that they secure and therefore the same may only exist to
the extent that the obligations of the principal obligor are valid. Therefore, upon a finding of lack of
genuineness, validity or enforceability of the obligations of the relevant Issuer under the relevant Notes, the
ancillary obligations of the Mexican Guarantors shall be equally affected and in such circumstances the
obligations provided for under the Notes might not be enforced in a proceeding before a Mexican court.

_Enforcement of Security Interests_

As a general principle under Mexican law, a secured creditor may not take possession of the collateral
without court intervention, and if it does so, such action could constitute a criminal offence. Generally
speaking, the main right that a security interest provides is the right to request a court to dispose of the
asset and apply the proceeds of the sale to payment of the secured obligation up to its outstanding amount.
Procedural steps to enforce liens before courts in Mexico depend on the nature of each security interest,
and on whether the debtor is in insolvency (concurso mercantil) or bankruptcy (quiebra), or is still doing
business. In any event, the procedural approach will vary and the type of action will depend on the
documentation held by the creditor.

Judgments of non-Mexican courts are enforceable in Mexico provided that a number of conditions are
met, including certain basic principles of Mexican due process rules and the non-violation of Mexican law
or public policy (orden público).

There are no limitations to the election of remedies in Mexico. Creditors can pursue multiple
remedies at the same time until the total amount of indebtedness is fully paid. The debtor is entitled to
receive any outstanding amount derived from the enforcement and foreclosure of all security interest, once
the secured obligations have been paid in full to the creditors.

_Certain Mexican Insolvency Law Considerations_

The Notes will be secured by a personal guarantee of the Mexican Guarantors and under Mexico’s
_Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, if any Mexican Guarantor participating under this offering is declared_
insolvent, bankrupt or becomes subject to concurso mercantil, such guarantor’s obligations under the Notes
would (i) be converted into Mexican pesos and then into an inflation indexed ratio (unidades de inversión)
at the date of concurso mercantil court declaration, (ii) cease to accrue interest, and (iii) be subject to
certain statutory preferences, including administrative claims, certain tax, social security, labor and secured
claims. Payment of debts incurred prior to the judicial declaration of concurso mercantil and foreclosure
will be stayed during the reorganization stage. If the personal guarantees of the Mexican Guarantors are
granted within three years prior to the date of the concurso mercantil declaration of any Mexican
Guarantor, such personal guarantees may be subject to challenges of avoidance within the concurso
_mercantil proceeding on the basis of being a gratuitous transaction in which the Mexican Guarantor_
assumed a debt with no legal consideration in return. The principles governing insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings in Mexican courts may differ from principles governing insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings
in other jurisdictions. Therefore, the ability of the holders of the Notes to effectively collect payments due
under the Notes may be compromised or subject to delay.

In the event that Mexican companies generally cease paying debts when due, they may be declared in
_concurso mercantil in accordance with the applicable law in Mexico (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles)._

Under Mexico’s Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, the concurso mercantil proceedings have two
consecutive phases: “conciliation” (conciliación) and “liquidation” (quiebra). The purpose of the
conciliation phase is to enable the continuation of the Mexican companies’ activities through the execution

341


-----

of a restructuring agreement with their creditors. The purpose of the liquidation phase is to liquidate the
business, as a whole or by the sale of operating units or their individual assets, to repay their creditors.
Companies may request to proceed to the liquidation phase directly, thereby avoiding the conciliation
stage.

According to Mexico’s Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, a company can enter concurso mercantil
proceedings if it has generally ceased paying debts when due when, is in payment default with respect to
two or more creditors, and either (i) requests to be declared in concurso mercantil and meets either of the
two conditions described below, or (ii) any of its creditors or the public prosecutor (Ministerio Público)
makes a claim for the concurso mercantil declaration of the company and the company meets both of the
following conditions:

   - 35% or more of the company’s outstanding liabilities are 30 days past due as of the date of the filing
of the concurso mercantil petition.

   - The company has insufficient liquid assets and receivables (which are specifically defined) to
support at least 80% of its obligations that are due and payable.

Two or more companies forming part of the same corporate group (grupo societario) can
simultaneously file a petition and be jointly declared in concurso mercantil, without substantive
consolidation.

A federal court with jurisdiction over the location in which a company maintains its domicile is
competent to receive the petition and conduct the concurso mercantil proceeding, except in the case of
holding or subsidiary companies, where the competent court will either be the court that is conducting the
first proceeding filed or has jurisdiction over the location in which the company maintains its domicile.

The judgment declaring a company in concurso mercantil will contain, among other things: (i) an
order to suspend the payment of debts incurred prior to the effectiveness date of the judgment, except for
those that are essential to the ordinary course of the company’s business, (ii) an order to suspend all writs
of attachment or foreclosure during the conciliation stage, with the exceptions set forth in Mexico’s Ley de
_Concursos Mercantiles (the court may consider some collateral non-essential for the ordinary course of the_
company’s business, such as some employment claims and secured claims), and (iii) a retroactive date
(fecha de retroacción) for purpose of scrutinizing any fraudulent conveyance (such date shall be the date
that is 270 days prior to the date of concurso mercantil declaration, and it may be extended up to three
years).

Upon the declaration of insolvency, all debts of the relevant company are automatically considered
due and payable, will cease to accrue interest, and be converted, if they are in foreign currency, into
Mexican pesos (if applicable), and then into unidades de inversión, which are inflation indexed reference
units, unless the debts are secured loans, which will be preserved in their original currency and continue to
accrue the agreed ordinary interest (with no default interest accrual) up to the value of the collateral. Any
provision of an agreement that worsens the contractual terms for a debtor pursuant to the filing of a
petition or a demand for, or the declaration of, concurso mercantil, shall be deemed not included therein.

The conciliation stage lasts 185 calendar days, but the governing bodies of the concurso mercantil or
certain specific majorities of creditors may authorize up to two extensions of 90 days each, if they
determine that they are close to reaching a restructuring agreement. In no event may the conciliation stage
be extended beyond 365 calendar days. If there is no restructuring agreement by this deadline, the
liquidation (quiebra) stage begins immediately. Once liquidation is declared, the judge starts with the
liquidation of the business, as a whole or by sale of operating units or their individual assets, to pay the
creditors’ claims according to their grades. Creditors are ranked in the following order, depending on the
nature of their credits:

(1) Privileged employment claims (salary and benefits accrued in the previous year and severance);

(2) Administrative claims and post-commencement financing;

(3) Claims incurred for regular expenses in connection with the security, repair,

(4) conservation and management of the estate assets;

(5) Claims for judicial or extrajudicial procedures for the benefit of the estate;

(6) Burial and terminal illness expenses (of individual debtors only);

342


-----

(7) Secured claims. These claims are paid out of the proceeds of the property that has been
collateralized, and generally in the order that the securities have been registered in accordance
with applicable law;

(8) Any remaining labor and employment claims;

(9) Unsecured tax claims;

(10) Priority claims, which are those from creditors with a privilege or a retention right (e.g., a
mechanics’ lien). These claims are paid out of the proceeds of the retained property and are
generally paid in the order of privilege that has been registered in accordance with applicable law
or by the date of the claims; and

(11) Unsecured claims and Subordinated creditors (including intercompany debt other than that of
the parents of the debtor).

No payments may be made to any creditor of a certain rank before all of the creditors of a better rank
have been paid off.

**The Netherlands**

If a Dutch company grants a guarantee or security interest and that guarantee or security interest is
not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and the beneficiary of the guarantee or
security interest knew or should have known this without independent investigation, the guarantee or
security interest may be nullified by the Dutch company, its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement)
and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling) or
otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining whether
the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would
not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but
all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects
clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or
security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the
benefit it derives from such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly
mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive
evidence to state that such legal act is in the corporate interests. In addition, if it is determined that there
are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the
guarantee or security interest, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the
enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be
successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the
company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which
it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security
interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such
guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial
interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the
guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is
determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial
benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above ultra vires concepts also apply with
respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the
document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress
(bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document.

Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may,
regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances
(onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet-toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and
fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include the right to suspend performance
(opschorting), dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). The enforceability of the
obligations of a Dutch company may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or
otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch
law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and
collection costs.

343


-----

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch
company may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or
more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value
of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association, as well as
on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the
relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise
Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

_Parallel Debt_

Under Dutch law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and
the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold
the secured claim but purports to hold security interests for the parties that do. The beneficial holders of
the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Transaction Security Documents. In order to permit
the Noteholders from time to time to have a secured claim, the Transaction Security Documents or other
finance documents will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the
Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the
Notes. The pledges governed by Dutch law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt structure
has not been tested under Dutch law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

_Fraudulent Transfer_

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a Dutch legal entity
may, under certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors or its administrator or bankruptcy
receiver (curator), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior existing legal
obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor
was prejudiced as a consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the
time the guarantee or security interest was granted both the Dutch legal entity and, unless the guarantee or
security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security
interest knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also, to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security
interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all
creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is
presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be
prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within one year of the granting and for no consideration. This is
applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the
obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing
obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and the beneficiary of such
guarantee or security interest when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if
the bankrupt and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest are part of the same group of
companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy
apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the
bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a
prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest
was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for
bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of
deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to
give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any
guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that
such challenge would be successful.

The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not
prevent effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation
has a close connection (and for this purpose “overriding provisions” are provisions the respect for which
are regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are
applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an
agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or not) that must be applied pursuant to the Recast
EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in

344


-----

which performance takes place in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the
event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement of each Dutch law security interest in the
Collateral (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch
law shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of
association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of third parties
acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw) may also affect the
binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral.

In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public
auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant security
interest provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the secured assets, except
when otherwise agreed. In the case of secured assets, the Security Agent and the security interest provider
may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure once the security right has become enforceable. The
security interest providers have agreed to waive the right to request such alternative foreclosure procedure.
The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the secured assets shall accrue
to it for a price determined by the court. In the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest
provider to request approval of a private sale may be excluded.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on
shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor.

If a security right is created in collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained title, such
collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a
moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than in
respect of rights of mortgage, if any), except that any security created over the shares in a Dutch company
should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of
the absence of any pre-existing security.

_Insolvency_

Guala Closures International B.V. is a Guarantor incorporated in the Netherlands (the “Dutch
**Guarantor”). Any insolvency proceedings concerning such Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee would likely be**
based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened
in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not established
under Dutch law.

Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the United States or other
jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would
normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the United States or another
jurisdiction. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments
(surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable
the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to
liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency
regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a moratorium of
payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is
set out below. This general description is subject to the emergency legislation discussed under
“—Administration Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19
_Pandemic” below._

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, and only if it
foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the request for a
moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and
appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). The court will also set a date for a meeting of creditors, which is
required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed
simultaneously with the application for moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition
will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and
subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive
moratorium will generally be granted unless (i) a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter in amount
of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of

345


-----

creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its
consent or (ii) if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium
of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.
That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices
that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within
the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a
statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months)
imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (afkoelingsperiode), a
moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. During such
stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the
security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a moratorium of payments
or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, during a moratorium of payments or
bankruptcy under Dutch law secured and (in the case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors
(including tax and social security authorities)) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in
moratorium of payments or the bankrupt company to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of
payments or bankruptcy. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does
not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, the court may order a “cooling down period”
(afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or
preferential creditors are barred. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of
law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt
company. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt debtor’s assets.

Both in a definitive moratorium of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered
to creditors. A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is
(i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) in number of the creditors represented at the
creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes
and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could
preclude or inhibit the ability of the Noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of
a holder of Notes in Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the
date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it is no longer able to pay its debts when
due. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a
claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the
creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be
declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to moratorium of payments. The debtor can also
request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het
_Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest_
(openbaar belang).

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The
general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment)
which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain creditors (such
as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over
the rights of other creditors.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be
valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable
within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy
was declared. Generally, claims of the Noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the
date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that
date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver to be verified in the
insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to
distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a moratorium of payments, that the
treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the

346


-----

unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for verification, and that the receiver then
determines the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted
in the bankruptcy proceedings to the purpose of voting and the distribution of the proceeds. Where
interest is accruing after the date of opening of the proceedings, it can be admitted pro memoria. To the
extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights
from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.
The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the Noteholders may be challenged in the
Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy
receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other
creditors.

In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’
meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount
and rank of the disputed claim, while in a moratorium of payments the court will decide how a disputed
claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause Noteholders to recover less than
the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation. Such renvooi
proceedings could also cause payments to the Noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of
undisputed claims. As mentioned above, a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding
on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a majority in number of the creditors
represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are admitted
for voting purposes and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in
itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the
secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who
will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in
Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is
construed.

Secured or preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their
rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no
bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling down period” for
a maximum of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are
barred (which may therefore result in a total period of eight months if the similar “cooling down period” of
the execution is first applied during moratorium of payments), unless such creditors have obtained leave
for enforcement from the supervisory judge (rechter- commissaris). Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can
force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the
receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the
bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the
bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the
bankruptcy. Such set-off is allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be
subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for
set-off. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery.

Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into
additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can
be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy, if (i) it performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii)
generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a
consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no
consideration (om niet)) the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or
more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In addition, in the case of such a bankruptcy,
their trustee may nullify its performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation)
an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling
_ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the_
performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a
view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.

Whether or not a Guarantor is insolvent in The Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a
guarantee or a security document may be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness
(redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden).

347


-----

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when a
moratorium of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the moratorium of payments
having become definitive, a composition having been ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court or the
declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for
such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under
Dutch law, bankruptcy and moratorium of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the
judgment of the bankruptcy or the moratorium of payments.

_Dutch Scheme_

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet
_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer_
a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is inspired on the UK Scheme of
Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure
their debt. Unlike a composition in moratorium of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition
under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter
_alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned_
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts
and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Dutch Guarantor
being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently
confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities
that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the
WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/ or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and
therefore the Notes.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two
third of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the
share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility
for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA,
the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of
shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves
the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a
composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that
such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a
bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides
for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the
detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal
ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a
debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the
right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the
request of such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a
possible extension of 4 months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the
assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action
to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over
receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in
respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request
of the debtor or restructuring expert.

_Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic_

The emergency legislation (the Temporary Covid-19 Social Affairs and Employment and Justice and
Security Act (Tijdelijke Wet Covid-19 SZW en JenV)) regarding a temporary suspension of enforcement and
other measures in support of enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic entered into force on
December 17, 2020. The emergency legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and several
related protections which apply until at least August 1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary, be extended
beyond that date for two month periods at a time.

The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than regulated entities) whose continuity is
threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the tax

348


-----

authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/
debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis-à-vis those creditors of two months (which may be
extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two month periods at a time).

If such moratorium is granted by the court then during such moratorium period:

(i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed;

(ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of
itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an
agreement with those creditors; and

(iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended,
and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the
assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court.

The measures referred to in (iii) above can also be requested in summary proceedings and
attachments can be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the
court only affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of
assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the
same decisions.

When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish
that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has
temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the moratorium
retain these rights vis-à-vis their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this
position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to
satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average
revenue in the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that following the
moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected
are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When granting a
moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests of the
creditor(s) are not prejudiced.

**Poland**

The Notes will be secured by a security interest granted over 70.0% of the entire issued share capital
of “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A. (“DGS”). DGS is incorporated as a joint stock company and
registered in Poland.

**_Insolvency (bankruptcy) Proceedings_**

DGS will not be a Guarantor of the Notes, however a portion of the entire issued share capital in
DGS will be subject to security, and therefore insolvency laws (and other applicable regulations) relevant
to the pledgor of the shares in the Polish company must be considered.

The sole fact of DGS becoming bankrupt does not affect the security interest granted over its shares,
but may materially adversely impact the value of such security.

The following is a general description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Poland relating to
bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings and how such laws affect the enforcement rights of secured and
unsecured creditors.

_General_

The insolvency laws of Poland are primarily set out in the Bankruptcy Law dated February 28, 2003
(Prawo upadłos´ciowe) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020, no. 1228, as
amended) (the “Polish Insolvency Law”).

By default, the courts of Poland have jurisdiction over insolvency proceedings of a company
incorporated and registered in Poland and with its center of main interests in Poland.

The insolvency laws of Poland and, in particular, the provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law in
relation to priority of creditors and the duration of insolvency proceedings may not be as favorable to

349


-----

creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to
recover payments, to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

Under the Polish Insolvency Law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent
insolvency court ex officio, but require a debtor or creditor to file a petition to commence insolvency
proceedings (the “bankruptcy petition”). The debtor is obliged, no later than within thirty days (30) from
the day on which the grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy arose, to file a bankruptcy petition with the
court.

A declaration of bankruptcy should be issued in respect of a debtor that has become insolvent. A
debtor is insolvent if: (i) it has lost the ability to perform its due pecuniary obligations (it is presumed that
a debtor has lost the ability to perform its due monetary obligations if the delay in payments exceeds three
months) or (ii) in the case of a legal entity with legal personality (osobowos´c´ prawna) or a legal entity
without legal personality, but which has legal capacity (i.e., the ability to enter into transactions and to be
the subject of rights and obligations (zdolnos´c´ prawna)), the debtor’s pecuniary obligations exceed the
value of its assets and this situation lasts for more than twenty-four months (although the entity satisfies its
monetary liabilities). It is presumed that a debtor’s pecuniary obligations exceed the value of its assets if
the balance sheet shows the debtor’s liabilities, exclusive of reserves for liabilities and of liabilities to
related entities, exceeding the value of the debtor’s assets and this state of affairs persists for a period in
excess of twenty four months). In the latter case, however, the court may refuse to sustain the bankruptcy
petition if there is no risk that the entity would cease to perform its monetary obligations in the near
future.

If the assets of the debtor are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings, the court will dismiss
the bankruptcy petition. The court may also dismiss a petition where it has been established that the assets
are encumbered by security (such as a mortgage or pledge) to such an extent that the residual assets are
insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings. However, the court will not order dismissal if it is
established that the encumbrances on the debtor’s assets are ineffective under the Polish Insolvency Law,
or that they were created to the detriment of creditors, and further, if it is established that the debtor
performed other acts, such as disposing of assets sufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings, which can
potentially be set aside under the Polish Insolvency Law and, as an additional condition, if the
circumstances of the case indicate that by applying the relevant provisions on the ineffectiveness and
contesting of the debtor’s acts, assets with a value in excess of the predicted costs will be obtained.

If the petition is dismissed, any conservatory measures are called off and the debtor is free to continue
its commercial activity.

Provisions of any agreement which stipulate that such an agreement will be terminated and/or
amended upon bankruptcy (or upon bankruptcy petition being filed) of one of the parties are invalid. Also,
provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt entity is a party which hinder or prevent the objectives
of the insolvency proceedings will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate.

Any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than Polish złoty, regardless of whether the claim has
fallen due or not, if put on the list of claims, must be converted into Polish złoty at the average exchange
rate of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) prevailing on the date on which the bankruptcy court issues a
decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy, creditors may be subject to
exchange rate risk between the date of the decision of the bankruptcy court on the debtor’s bankruptcy and
the date of receipt of any proceeds of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings will be
carried out through liquidation of the bankrupt debtor’s assets.

In insolvency proceedings, all creditors, whether secured or unsecured, wishing to assert claims against
the debtor, need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Polish insolvency proceedings are in
principle collective proceedings and creditors are barred from pursuing their individual claims separately.

Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the relevant insolvency proceeding (lodging
of claims) and will be paid on a pro rata basis out of the bankruptcy estate. Creditors who have a security
interest over the debtor’s assets or any part thereof have priority rights under the governing law of the
security interest and under the relevant provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law. In essence, secured
creditors are not entitled to enforce such security interest outside the relevant insolvency proceeding.

Creditors secured by a registered pledge may enforce their security interest directly by way of
appropriation of such collateral.

350


-----

_Priority of Creditors in Insolvency Proceedings_

The funds of the bankruptcy estate will include proceeds of the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate,
and income earned from running or leasing the bankrupt’s enterprise, as well as interest on bank deposits.

Sums obtained from the transfer of assets and rights encumbered with a mortgage or pledge will be
allocated to satisfy those creditors whose receivable debts were secured over the transferred assets or
rights.

The Polish Insolvency Law governs the priority of claims for (i) secured creditors (i.e., creditors whose
claims are secured by a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or treasury pledge) and (ii) other creditors. In
the latter case, the Polish Insolvency Law provides for four categories of debts, which include a number of
preferential debts (such as money owed to employees) and several less-preferential ones (ex. money owed
to the shareholder and related to the shareholder’s loan or arising from a similar legal action, which are
repaid in the last 4[th] category).

In cases where creditors have rights in rem to the sold tangible property or rights, the receiver makes a
separate plan to distribute the money earned on the sold tangible property or rights.

If the sum allocated for distribution is not sufficient to satisfy all the debts in full, debts of lower
categories of priority are satisfied only after the full satisfaction of debts of preceding categories of priority,
and when the assets are insufficient to satisfy in full all debts within the same category of priority, then
such debts shall be satisfied on a pro rata basis.

_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

After a debtor is declared bankrupt, the following are recognized as ineffective against the bankruptcy
estate, by operation of law:

(i) a disposition of the debtor’s assets can be avoided if it was effected in the one year preceding the
filing of a petition for the commencement of an insolvency proceeding, if the transaction was
gratuitous or for consideration manifestly lower than the consideration received by the debtor;

(ii) satisfaction of a debt before its maturity date or the granting of security in respect of such debt, if
effected within the period of six months preceding the filing of a petition for the commencement
of an insolvency proceeding, and if, at the time of such transaction, the debtor was already
insolvent and the creditor had knowledge of it;

(iii) a transaction made within the period of six months preceding the filing of a petition for the
commencement of an insolvency proceeding where the debtor is a legal person and the other
party is its shareholder, representative (or spouse of such person) or affiliated company, or such
affiliated company’s shareholder, representative (or spouse of such person) (and noting that the
same rule applies if the debtor entered into a transaction with a dominant company).
Ineffectiveness is recognized by the judge in charge of the bankruptcy proceedings and shall be
determined, ex officio or at the request of the receiver.

Security interests granted over a party’s assets in the form of registered pledges or other security
interests may be voidable transactions which are capable of being challenged by an administrator of the
bankruptcy estate and may be set aside by a judge-commissioner ex officio within two years of a
declaration of bankruptcy, if: the party was not personally liable for the debt and such security interest was
granted less than one year preceding the date of the bankruptcy petition; if the party did not receive any
consideration for the granting of such security interest or the consideration received was
disproportionately low in comparison to the value of the security interest granted; or regardless of the
value of consideration previously received by the party, security interests were granted to secure debts of
companies in the same corporate group.

Other actions detrimental to creditors may also be challenged on the basis of the Actio -Pauliana,
governed by articles 527 onward of the Polish Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny).

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

The restructuring laws of Poland are primarily set out in the Restructuring Law dated 15 May 2015
(Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne ) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020, no. 814 as
amended) (the “Polish Restructuring Law”).

351


-----

A debtor may also apply for restructuring proceedings if the debtor at risk of insolvency or is insolvent
(the “Restructuring Proceedings”). A creditor may apply for remedial proceeding (one of the types of the
Restructuring Proceedings (please see below)) but only if a debtor is insolvent.

The Restructuring Proceedings may be carried out against a debtor who is insolvent and/or at risk of
insolvency. An insolvent debtor shall be construed as a debtor who is insolvent in the meaning of the Polish
Insolvency Law. A debtor threatened with insolvency shall be construed as a debtor whose economic
situation indicates that he may soon become insolvent. The Restructuring Proceedings shall be instituted
on the basis of the restructuring application filed by the debtor. The restructuring application shall be
construed as an application for the opening of the restructuring proceedings and an application for the
approval of the arrangement adopted in the arrangement approval proceedings.

The restructuring shall be carried out under the following Restructuring Proceedings: (i) arrangement
approval proceedings (poste˛powanie o zatwierdzenie układu), (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings
(przyspieszone poste˛powanie układowe), (iii) arrangement proceedings (poste˛powanie układowe), (iv)
remedial proceedings (poste˛powanie sanacyjne).

In the case of filing a restructuring application and a bankruptcy application, the restructuring
application shall be examined first.

The purpose of the Restructuring Proceedings is to avoid a declaration of bankruptcy of the debtor by
enabling him to restructure through an arrangement with creditors and, in the case of remedial
proceedings, by carrying out remedial actions, whilst safeguarding the legitimate rights of creditors.

The arrangement approval proceedings shall enable the conclusion of the arrangement, where the
debtor shall collect the creditors’ votes by himself without involvement of the court and may be carried out
if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the
total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement.

The accelerated arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after
the table of claims under a simplified procedure has been prepared and approved; it may be carried out if
the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total
claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement.

The arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after the table of
claims has been prepared and approved and may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the
right to vote on the arrangement exceeds 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the
arrangement.

Cases in the Restructuring Proceedings shall be examined by a restructuring court. The district
court— commercial court shall be the restructuring court.

**_Preservation of security in Restructuring Proceedings_**

As a rule, once Restructuring Proceedings have commenced it will not be possible to create a new
security interest to secure a pre-petition debt (unless the council of creditors agrees otherwise). However,
if a motion to register a mortgage or a registered pledge is filed more than six months before the filing of a
motion to open Restructuring Proceedings, the mortgage or pledge will be registered.

This does not modify the general rule that pre-petition in rem security interests (e.g., mortgage,
pledge, registered pledge, security assignment) survive the Restructuring Proceedings and the claims
secured by any of these security interests are not affected by the arrangement. However, the arrangement
will cover secured claims to the extent that these claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the
relevant secured creditor agrees to be covered by the arrangement. Secured creditors consenting to the
arrangement may be allocated to a separate class of creditors and be afforded special treatment in the
arrangement (i.e., different from unsecured creditors).

There is an important exception to this rule in relation to partial arrangements (which are permitted
in arrangement approval proceedings and accelerated arrangement proceedings), if the proposed
arrangement offers the relevant secured creditor full satisfaction (although on a date specified in the
arrangement) or satisfaction in part, but to the extent not lower than that expected in the case of
enforcement of security. If this exception applies, the relevant secured claim will be covered by the
arrangement irrespective of the creditor’s consent.

352


-----

Certain security will be infective towards the remedial estate (masa sanacyjna), namely:

(i) security established by the debtor within one year before the date of filing the application for the
opening of remedial proceedings which has not been established directly in connection with the
receipt of the performance by the debtor shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate;

(ii) security in the part which on the day of the establishment of the security exceeds more than half
the value of the secured performance received by the debtor together with claims for incidental
performance determined in the document forming the grounds to provide security, established
within the year prior to the date of the filing of the application for the opening of remedial
proceedings, shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate.

**_Security interests—pledges_**

Under Polish law, in general, all security interests, including, without limitation, pledges, are
considered accessory to the underlying secured claims, i.e., the security interest will automatically
terminate if the secured claims are repaid, terminated or become void.

The establishment of certain security interests in Poland requires the execution of appropriate
documents and often making entries into registers or making filings with the relevant courts. The
establishment of a pledge requires the execution of contractual documents (in the form of pledge
agreements) and, with respect to registering the pledge, the entry of the pledge in the pledge register held
by the relevant Polish court. Also, with respect to the shares in joint-stock companies (spółka akcyjna) it is
required to register a pledge in a shareholders register (rejestr akcjonariuszy).

The process of registration of a registered pledge usually takes up to two months and, until
registration is complete, the registered pledge will not legally exist under Polish law. Once registered, the
order of priority of the registered pledges will be determined by the order in which the applications for
registration of pledges were submitted to the court. In respect of certain rights, such as rights over shares,
over which a registered pledge is to be granted, the payment obligations may also be secured by a
“financial pledge”. However, a financial pledge does not grant the same scope of rights to the secured
creditors as a registered pledge.

A secondary bankruptcy proceeding may be opened in Poland against a pledgor with a seat in country
other than Poland.

In respect of a registered pledge, the pledgee will have the right to satisfy claims secured by such
registered pledge (if so provided by the relevant pledge agreement) through standard court enforcement
or through out-of-court methods of enforcement, by assuming title to the pledged assets on the terms set
out in the respective pledge agreement or through the sale of such assets in an auction conducted by a
notary public or a court enforcement officer, in priority to other creditors. However, if any third-party
creditor initiates enforcement proceedings to satisfy their claims in respect of the assets secured by a
registered pledge, then the pledgee will not be able to exercise any of the out-of-court methods of
enforcement discussed above in relation to such assets, but rather will only be entitled to enforcement of
such pledge via a standard court enforcement process, which is usually considered more time-consuming
and more expensive for the secured creditor.

In the event of enforcement of a pledge over shares in a company organized under the laws of Poland,
the Polish regulations in respect of the pledge and the provisions of Polish company law with respect to the
transfer of shares have to be adhered to.

The security interest granted for the benefit of the pledgee in Poland often includes the grant of both
financial pledges and registered pledges over the same assets. The legal validity of the co-existence of
registered and financial pledges over the same asset and securing the same claim is untested under Polish
law and could be subject to challenge.

_The Competition Act (change of control)_

Pursuant to the Polish Competition Act dated February 16, 2007 (Ustawa o ochronie konkurencji i
_konsumentów) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2021, item 275), taking_
control over an undertaking by way of, among other things, an acquisition of shares and/or any part of its
assets and/or an acquisition of a right to exercise the voting rights under shares held in such an
undertaking, may require prior approval of the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer
Protection (“OCCP”). It follows that, if a pledgee were to enforce a registered pledge by way of acquiring

353


-----

title to the pledged shares or by exercising the voting rights in respect of those shares, it may require prior
approval of the OCCP. Violation of the Polish Competition Act may result in fines and/or in case restoring
competition it is not feasible otherwise a duty to dispose of the acquired assets / shares or other remedial
actions. Please note that such an acquisition may require approval from the European Commission (in
such a case approval of the OCCP is not required) and/or the competition authorities of other countries.

_Polish Act on Control on Certain Investments_

Pursuant to the Polish Act on Control on Certain Investments dated July 24, 2015 (Ustawa o kontroli
_niektórych inwestycji) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020, item 2145)_
Poland has a COVID-19 related foreign investment regime which covers all non-EEA/EU/OECD
investors’ (i) acquisitions of 20% or more of voting rights, shares or share in the profits of the Polish
companies operating in the sectors considered as sensitive that generated turnover of more than
€10 million in Poland, (ii) acquisitions that results in crossing 20% or 40% threshold of respective
entitlement (voting rights, shares or share in the profits) or (iii) acquisition or lease from a company
operating in a sector considered as sensitive of its enterprise or organized part of its enterprise (the
“COVID-19 FI regime”). The COVID-19 FI regime covers a broad scope of acquisitions performed by
non-EEA/EU/OECD investors with:

(i) pre-closing suspensory approval requirement for direct acquisitions of Polish protected
companies; and

(ii) post-closing approval requirement in case of indirect acquisitions of Polish protected companies
(e.g., when the transaction concerns the acquisition, by a non-Polish entity, of a stake in a Polish
protected company, which falls within the COVID-19 FI regime).

If the transaction triggers a filing it must be notified to the OCCP and consent must be received
before it is carried out. The timing and practicalities of notification (for instance whether a notification
should be made pre- or post-closing) will depend on the details of a transaction (e.g., whether transactions
concern the direct or indirect acquisition of a protected company).

Assuming that DGS is considered as operating in sensitive sector, then if a pledgee, being non-EEA/
EU/OECD entity, were to enforce a registered pledge by way of acquiring title to the pledged shares or by
exercising the voting rights in respect of those shares, it may require approval of the OCCP. Failure to
notify the acquisition to the President of the OCCP may result in fines, criminal liability as well as,
depending on the type of acquisition (direct or indirect), either its voidness or prohibition to exercise rights
attached to shares of the Polish company.

_Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners_

Under the Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners dated March 24, 1920 (Ustawa
_o nabywaniu nieruchomos´ci przez cudzoziemców) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw)_
of 2017, item 2278, as amended) (the “Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners”), the acquisition of
ownership or perpetual usufruct right (perpetual usufruct is a local 99-year leasehold title, very close to the
ownership) over real estate in Poland or the acquisition of shares in a Polish company being an owner or
perpetual usufuctuary of real estate in Poland, or any other action through which such Polish company
becomes controlled by a foreign entity, in certain situations requires a permit from the Polish Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Administration (a “MOI Permit”). The Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by
Foreigners provides for a number of exemptions from the duty to obtain a MOI Permit. In particular, such
duty is waived in respect of acquisition of shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, acquisition of
shares in a company by bank having its registered office in Poland (if related to claims pursued by the bank
arising from bank transactions) and to acquisitions made by foreign Shareholders or persons domiciled in
countries which are members of the European Economic Area. However, these exemptions are not
absolute and they do not apply to certain types of real estate (such as the real properties located within the
border zone).

Under the Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners an acquisition by the pledgee of shares in
a company organized under the laws of Poland in the course of the enforcement of a pledge over such
shares may also require a MOI Permit if the pledgee does not have a registered office in a country which is
a member of the European Economic Area.

_New Act on Agricultural Land_

On April 30, 2016 the Act on Prohibiting the Sale of Real Properties Held in State Treasury
Resources and on the Amendment of Certain Other Acts dated April 14, 2016 (Ustawa o wstrzymaniu
_sprzedaz˙y nieruchomos´ci Zasobu Własnos´ci Rolnej Skarbu Pan´stwa oraz o zmianie niektórych ustaw) (Journal_
of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2016 item 585) (the “New Act on Agricultural Land”) entered into force. The
New Act on Agricultural Land among other provided relevant amendments to the Agricultural System Act
dated April 11, 2003 (Ustawa o kształtowaniu ustroju rolnego) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws
(Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020 item 1665) (the “Act on Agricultural Land”).

The Act on Agricultural Land with respect to disposal of shares of a company being an owner or
perpetual usufructary of agricultural land of a total area not less than 5 ha (50.000 sq. m.) introduces the
following rights of the Agricultural Agency (Krajowy Os´rodek Wsparcia Rolnictwa):

   - pre-emptive right applicable in the case of shares sale, and

   - buy-out right applicable in case of disposing of shares in any legal form other than sale. However if
the other legal form results in transfer of agricultural land ownership or perpetual usufruct right,
the consent of the Agricultural Agency for such transfer will be required.

The above listed Agricultural Agency’s rights apply (i) even if the agricultural land constitutes an
inconsiderable part of the assets of the company, (ii) regardless of how many shares are being transferred
(there is no minimum threshold in this respect, so even a transfer of one share triggers the Agricultural
Agency’s right) and (iii) also in case of taking up shares in the increased share capital by the current sole
shareholder. However, the Act on Agricultural Land provides for certain exceptions in this respect,
including in particular exemption for acquisition of shares of companies listed on the stock exchange.

In case a company organized under the laws of Poland owns the agricultural properties an acquisition
by the pledgee of shares in that company in the course of the enforcement of a pledge may also be (with
the reservation of certain exemptions) subject to pre-emption/buyout rights and/or prior consent of the
Agricultural Agency.

**_Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments_**

The recognition and enforcement of judgments of foreign courts in Poland is subject to limitations,
including those set forth in (i) the Code of Civil Procedure (the “PCCP”) (applicable in general to
judgments of courts of non-EU countries) and (ii) Council Regulation (EC) Regulation (EU)
No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December, 2012 on jurisdiction and
the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “Brussels
**Regulation”) (applicable in general to judgments issued by courts of EU Member States).**

According to the Brussels Regulation a judgment issued in one Member State should be enforceable
in the other Member States without a declaration of enforceability. An enforceable judgment entails by
operation of law the power to apply any protective measures that exist under the law of the Member State
of enforcement. Therefore, according to these provisions, all judgments issued in civil and commercial
cases by courts in Belgium are directly enforceable in Poland.

Pursuant to the provisions of the PCCP, rulings/judgements of the courts of foreign non-EU countries
(including now the United Kingdom, as no agreement or convention has yet been concluded in this
respect) in civil matters that may be enforced by execution on the territory of Poland, become enforceable
titles when their enforcement is confirmed by a Polish court. Enforcement is confirmed if a ruling/
judgment is enforceable in the state of origin and is not blocked by the obstacles referred to in Article
1146§1 of the PCCP, which includes inter alia an obligation for the court to refuse recognition of a
judgment that is contrary to the fundamental principles of the Polish legal order (public policy clause).
This regulation may be modified by international agreements.

**Scotland**

One of the Guarantors, Guala Closures U.K. Limited, is a company incorporated under the laws of
Scotland (the “Scottish Guarantor”). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Scottish
Guarantor would likely be based on Scottish insolvency laws. However, where insolvency proceedings were
commenced before the IP Completion Day, the EU Insolvency Regulation (which applies to insolvencies
commenced prior to June 26, 2017) and the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (which applies to
insolvencies commenced after June 26, 2017) would apply to those proceedings. This would mean that

355


-----

where a company incorporated under Scots law had its “center of main interest” in a Member State of the
European Union and not in Scotland (or another part of the UK), then the main insolvency proceedings
for that company may be opened in the Member State in which its center of main interest is located and be
subject to the laws of that Member State. Similarly, the U.K. Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006,
which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom,
provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any Scottish company has a center of its main
interests in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in
such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and
assets or services).

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (a) an administrator
appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash
subject to the floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing
to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating
charger holder; (b) a fixed security over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have
priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the
liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the floating charge assets
to the extent the assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet
them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until
the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is usually entitled to deal with assets that are subject to
floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can effectively be
disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating
charge; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under Scottish insolvency law (see
“—Grant of Floating Charge” below); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential
creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions, salaries owed to the employees (subject to a
cap per employee), holiday pay owed to employees and certain taxes due to HMRC such as VAT) and,
where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of unsecured
creditors in respect of a ring-fenced amount of the proceeds (see “—Administration and Floating Charges”
below).

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not
recognize the English law concept of “equity”, there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the
intention of the parties with respect to the creation of security interests. If the strict legal requirements
under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subjects notwithstanding the intention of the
parties.

In respect of moveable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession
(which may take different forms) over the security subject(s) in order to create a valid security interest.
Scots law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in
order to create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder
(or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, there is no Scottish equivalent of an
English law of equitable assignment, and an interest in Scottish incorporeal property will only be created
when the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties.

Fixed security over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard
security (which is the Scottish law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land), and this is
governed by statute.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, Scottish courts are empowered to make an administration order in
respect of a Scottish company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of
court by the company, its directors, or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different appointment
procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor.

During the administration, there is a moratorium in place, which in general means that no
proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security
enforced over the company’s property, except with the consent of the administrator or with the leave of the
court. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (such as a
charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt

356


-----

instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During the
administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than
security financial collateral agreement) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator
or the court. In addition, a secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver.

In order to empower a secured creditor to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to
the company, the floating charge by the relevant Scottish company must constitute a “qualifying floating
charge” for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative
receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003,
fall within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of
administrative receivers.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an
instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the
holder to appoint an administrator of the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver; or (d) purports to empower the holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint
a receiver who on appointment would be an administrative receiver (although this is only permitted under
limited circumstances). A secured creditor can appoint an administrator by the out-of-court route, or an
administrative receiver (subject to the restrictions noted below), if it holds a qualifying floating charge
security, which together (if necessary) with fixed charge security interests and other floating charges,
relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Scottish company’s property. Whether the
assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of
the relevant Scottish company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question
of fact at that time.

Even if the secured creditor holds a qualifying floating charge, it can only appoint an administrative
receiver if one of the exceptions to the general prohibition of appointing an administrative receiver applies
or the security pre-dates September 15, 2003. The most relevant exception to the prohibition is that a
secured creditor can appoint an administrative receiver relating to a “capital market arrangement” (as
defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), which is the case if the issue of the note creates a
debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the
arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the U.K. Insolvency
Act 1986 as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

An administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain
percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured
creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and
20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000 (where the floating charge
was created on or after September 15, 2003 but before April 6, 2020) or £800,000 (where the floating
charge was created on or after April 6, 2020).

The appointment of an administrator ceases to have effect one year from the date of appointment
(unless terminated early by the administrator if the administration objectives have been achieved, or where
the company is dissolved or put into liquidation, or by the court following application by the administrator
or a creditor), but may be extended by up to one year with consent of each secured creditor (and in certain
circumstances preferential creditors or unsecured creditors) or by the court for any specified period on
application by the administrator.

**_Challenges to Guarantees_**

There are circumstances under Scottish insolvency law in which the granting by a company organized
under the laws of Scotland (a “Scottish company”) of a guarantee can be challenged. In most cases this will
only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the
granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or
liquidator is appointed to a Scottish company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security
given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to the Notes Guarantee to be granted by the
Scottish Guarantor:

**_Gratuitous Alienations_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, (i) a liquidator, (ii) an administrator, (iii) an assignee of the cause in
action from a liquidator or administrator or (iv) a creditor of a Scottish company could apply to the

357


-----

Scottish courts for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company (or give
other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gratuitous
alienation. The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a gratuitous alienation if at the time of
or as a result of the transaction, the Scottish company is insolvent. The transaction can be challenged if the
Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from
the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee, or five years in the case of a
gratuitous alienation (the English equivalent is a transaction at undervalue) to a connected party if the
company makes a gift to a person (save in certain specified circumstances), if the company receives no
consideration, or if the company receives consideration of less value, in money or money’s worth, than the
consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if the person seeking
to uphold the alienation establishes (i) that immediately or at any other time or after the alienation, the
company’s assets were greater than its liabilities, (ii) the alienation was made for adequate consideration;
or (iii) the alienation was a birthday, Christmas or other gift for a charitable purpose to a person who is not
an associate of the company, which in all circumstances it was reasonable for the company to make
(without prejudice to any right or interest acquired in good faith and for value from the recipient of the
alienation). If the court determines that the transaction was a gratuitous alienation, the court can grant a
reduction or for restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate. In any
proceedings, it is for the person seeking to uphold the alleged gratuitous alienation to demonstrate that the
Scottish company was solvent (the test for which is set out in clause (i) above).

A transaction made at a time when a company is insolvent may also constitute a gratuitous alienation
at common law. In these circumstances, no time limits apply in relation to challenging it. A gratuitous
alienation may constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading, or a breach of duty, and lead to action
being raised against directors personally.

**_Unfair Preferences_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, (i) a liquidator, (ii) an administrator, (iii) an assignee of the cause in
action from a liquidator or administrator or (iv) a creditor of a Scottish company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee (or give other relief) on the grounds that the
security interest or such guarantee constituted an unfair preference. The transaction can be challenged if
the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months
from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may
constitute an unfair preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Scottish company (or a surety
or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company
going into insolvent liquidation or administration) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise
have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was
an unfair preference, the court may grant a reduction or restoration of the property or assets or such other
redress as may be appropriate (although there is protection for a third party who acquires any rights or
interests through the creditor in whose favor the preference was created in good faith, for value and
without notice). An unfair preference may also constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading or a
breach of duty and lead to actions being raised against directors personally.

The following will not constitute unfair preferences:

   - transactions in the ordinary course of business;

   - payment in cash for a debt that, when paid, has become payable, unless the transaction was
collusive for the purpose of prejudicing the general body of creditors;

   - transactions where the parties take on reciprocal obligations, unless the transaction was collusive;
and

   - payments made on the basis of court decree in certain prescribed circumstances

**_Grant of Floating Charge_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, if a Scottish company is insolvent at the time of (or as a result of)
granting a floating charge, then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the
money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the Scottish
company, at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge.

If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, then such floating charge is invalid except to
the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction

358


-----

of any debt of the Scottish company, at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge,
whether the Scottish company is solvent or insolvent.

Where the floating charge is granted to a connected person, the transaction can be challenged if the
Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration within a period of two years from the date the
Scottish company grants the floating charge. The relevant period for challenge is one year where the
floating charge is granted to an unconnected person.

**_Considerations on the Enforceability of Guarantees_**

A pure guarantee is an accessory obligation by a guarantor relating to the primary obligation of the
party whose obligations are guaranteed. If the primary obligation is altered, discharged or fails, the
guarantee may not be enforceable. However, the document containing the guarantee will almost invariably
contain an indemnity, i.e., a direct obligation from the guarantor to the third party as an independent
primary obligation. The indemnity should survive even if the guarantee is unenforceable in the
circumstances described above. No limitation language is required to be included in the Indenture relating
to the Notes Guarantee by the Scottish Guarantor.

Corporate benefit must be established if a company is granting a guarantee. If there is doubt about
whether there is corporate benefit, shareholders’ approval for the act may be obtained, although the act
could still be challenged by other parties such as creditors. In addition, if no corporate benefit is
established and a liquidator or administrator is appointed to the company, the transaction is more
susceptible to an attack by the liquidator or an administrator as an “unfair preference” or a “gratuitous
alienation” and may be rendered unenforceable.

**_Set-off_**

The term “set-off” when it is used in Scottish law is a composite term which includes compensation,
the right of retention and the balancing of accounts in bankruptcy. There is no automatic right of set-off in
insolvency proceedings and creditors seeking to rely upon set-off will be required to plead the basis of that
right to either the insolvency practitioner adjudicating upon their claim, or a court or other arbitrating
authority determining the claims in an insolvency.

**_Directors’ Authority_**

If no corporate benefit is established, it may not be possible to enforce a guarantee granted where the
directors of the company giving the guarantee exceeded their authority. Directors will exceed their
authority if a transaction is beyond the objects or powers in the company’s articles of association (i.e., its
constitution). A third party dealing in good faith with a company can still enforce the transaction.

However, a third party will not be acting in good faith if it knows the transaction is beyond the power
of the directors and is not for the benefit of the company (e.g., a guarantee has no corporate benefit for
the company but benefits the directors or another person). In a transaction of this nature it is therefore
market practice for the legal advisors to confirm that there are no such restrictions in the articles of
association.

**_Temporary special insolvency provisions enacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA 2020”) suspended the liability of
directors for wrongfully trading a company from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. The Corporate
Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful Trading and
Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020 (“CIGA Regs 2020”) then suspended the liability of
directors for wrongfully trading from November 26, 2020 to April 30, 2021. The Corporate Insolvency and
Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2021 (“CIGA Regs
**2021”) then further extended that suspension until June 30, 2021.**

CIGA 2020 restricted a creditor from presenting a winding-up petition based on a statutory demand
served on or after March 1, 2020 or from presenting a winding-up petition on the grounds of a company’s
inability to pay its debts unless they have reasonable grounds for believing that coronavirus has not had a
financial effect on the company or that the debt issues would have arisen anyway, with such restrictions
scheduled to expire on March 31, 2021. CIGA Regs 2021 extended these restrictions to June 30, 2021.

CIGA 2020 also made some changes to the Insolvency Act 1986 (“IA86”) by introducing the ability to
apply for a temporary moratorium on legal proceedings outwith a formal insolvency process. A company

359


-----

will be ineligible for a moratorium if: (i) it is not an “eligible company”, (ii) a moratorium for the company
is already in force, (iii) it is already subject to an insolvency procedure; (iv) during the period of 12 months
prior to the filing date, it has been subject to a moratorium, unless the court orders otherwise; or (v) during
the period of 12 months prior to the filing date, it has been subject to a company voluntary arrangement
(“CVA”) or administration (although for a temporary period, initially ending on September 30, 2020, and
extended to September 30, 2021 by the CIGA Regs 2021, this restriction is disapplied). The directors of a
company can obtain a moratorium by filing relevant documents at court and the moratorium comes into
effect on that date of filing. A company with an outstanding winding up petition is required to seek a court
order to avail of a moratorium (although this requirement is waived until September 30, 2021 by the CIGA
Regs 2021) and the moratorium will come into effect on the date of the court order. The initial
moratorium lasts for 20 business days. The directors can extend the moratorium for a further 20 business
days provided that they can confirm that all moratorium debts have been or will be met. Further extensions
require pre-moratorium creditor consent, (subject to a maximum period for the moratorium of one year)
or court order (with no maximum moratorium length).

The moratorium is monitored by an insolvency practitioner, who shall determine whether it is
appropriate for the moratorium to remain in place, including ongoing monitoring of whether it remains
likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern (or for the relevant
period, would do but for COVID-19), and shall sanction certain acts by the company.

The moratorium has the effect of restricting the enforcement or payment of pre-moratorium debts,
enforcement of security or repossession of goods in the company’s possession (except with leave of the
court), commencing or continuing legal proceedings (except with leave of the court), or a landlord
exercising a right of irritancy (again except with leave of the court). Further, the moratorium prevents a
floating charge from crystallizing and prevents restrictions being imposed on the disposal of assets.

**_Restructuring procedures_**

As well as the formal insolvency procedures noted above (administration, administrative receivership
and liquidation), Scottish insolvency law provides for three processes within which a restructuring of debt
and/or the corporate group can be achieved, namely CVAs, Schemes of Arrangement and Restructuring
Plans.

A CVA is a voluntary arrangement, supervised by an insolvency practitioner, that becomes binding on
the company and its creditors following approval by 75% by value of the company’s creditors who
responded to the invitation to vote (unless those voting against the CVA include more than 50% by value
of unconnected creditors). The nature of a CVA proposal is flexible and the compromises and
arrangements with creditors that may be proposed vary on a case by case basis. Creditors holding security
interests cannot be bound by the terms of a CVA unless they specifically consent. Within 28 days of
approval of a CVA, it may be challenged in court by creditors entitled to vote or certain other persons on
the grounds of unfair prejudice or material irregularity.

A Scheme of Arrangement is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006 whereby a company may
make a compromise or arrangement with its members and/or creditors. Like a CVA, the nature of the
compromise or arrangement is flexible and not prescribed by legislation. Members and/or creditors are
divided into classes based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights and a Scheme of Arrangement must
be approved by a majority in number representing 75% in value of the members and/or creditors in each
class who vote in person or by proxy. The permission of the court is required to convene the meetings of
the members and/or creditors. Where the Scheme of Arrangement is approved by the members and/or
creditors, the court must decide whether to sanction this. Where the court does sanction the Scheme of
Arrangement, it will be binding on all creditors and members. CIGA 2020 introduces a new Restructuring
Plan. Like a Scheme of Arrangement, it is a court-sanctioned compromise or arrangement with creditors.
Unlike a Scheme of Arrangement, a Restructuring Plan can only be proposed where the company has
encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect its ability
to carry on business as a going concern. As with a Scheme of Arrangement, members and/or creditors are
divided into classes based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights and the permission of the court is
required to convene the meetings of the members and/or creditors. A Restructuring Plan must be
approved by 75% in value of the members and/or creditors in each class who vote in person or by proxy.,
Unlike a Scheme of Arrangement, a Restructuring Plan can be sanctioned by the court where it has not
been approved by each class of members and/or creditors, provided that at least one class which has a
genuine economic interest in the company approves the Restructuring Plan and certain tests regarding the
‘relevant alternative’ are met.

**Spain**

**_First demand guarantee_**

The figure of a first demand guarantee is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code (Código
_Civil) but its validity and effectiveness has been admitted in several judgments and regulated by the_
Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo) as an autonomous guarantee, detached from the underlying
agreement whose obligations are being guaranteed, acknowledging therefore the validity of the provision
pursuant to which the guarantor has renounced to call on enforceability exceptions different to those
arising from the guarantee.

Notwithstanding this, case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations, the
guarantor automatically objects to the beneficiary of the guarantee the exception of fraud, bad faith or
abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the events where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a
fraudulent manner or with bad faith. Besides, case law has also admitted that the guarantor can stay the
enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of
proof), usually through declaratory relief started by the guarantor.

**_Insolvency and Bankruptcy_**

One of the Guarantors of the Notes, Guala Closures Ibérica, S.A.U., is incorporated and organized
under the laws of Spain (the “Spanish Guarantor”). Accordingly, pre-insolvency, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings with respect to the Spanish Guarantor may proceed under, and be governed by, the insolvency
laws of Spain.

The insolvency laws of Spain may differ from the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or
other jurisdictions to which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of
Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020, of May 5 (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se
_aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal) (the “Spanish Insolvency Act”) and various extraordinary_
resolutions including, among others, Royal Decree Law 34/2020, of November 17 (Real Decreto-ley
_34/2020, de 17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial y al sector energético, y_
_en materia tributaria) (“Act 34/2020”) or Act 3/2020, of September 18 (Ley 3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de_
_medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de_
_Justicia) (“Act 3/2020”), that have been approved as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. These resolutions_
have introduced several temporary and extraordinary measures that impact pre-insolvency and insolvency
proceedings. Future changes, amendments or restatements of the Spanish Insolvency Act cannot be
disregarded either.

The Spanish Insolvency Act regulates pre-insolvency institutions and court insolvency proceedings.
Prospective investors should note that preceding Law 22/2003 regarding insolvency proceedings suffered
various reforms and amendments since it was first published in 2003. The Spanish Government approved
in 2020 the latest recasting, in force as from September 1, 2020, in order not only to incorporate all these
amendments but also to clarify and harmonize certain questions raised by the courts and the doctrine since
its first application by Spanish courts. However, it should be noted that certain matters are still be subject
to different views and different interpretations by the relevant insolvency courts from time to time.

The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of
June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on
measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of
debt, implies that Spain will have two years as of such date to transpose such Directive into the Spanish
regulations. This transposition process will probably lead to the approval of certain amendments to the
Spanish Insolvency Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transposition process has not been initiated yet
and, therefore, it is still uncertain how this Directive will affect the Spanish Insolvency Act.

In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current or imminent
insolvency. A debtor is deemed insolvent when it becomes unable to regularly meet its obligations as they
become due and payable (current insolvency or insolvencia actual) or when it expects that it will shortly be
unable to do so (imminent insolvency or insolvencia inminente). The insolvency proceedings may be
initiated either by the debtor (“voluntary insolvency” or concurso voluntario), by any of its creditors
(provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the filing of the petition for
insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature) or by certain other
interested third parties (“compulsory insolvency” or concurso necesario). Notwithstanding, only the debtor
is entitled to file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its imminent insolvency. Whether insolvency

361

proceedings are voluntary or compulsory will affect the basis for the insolvency, as well as impact upon the
debtor’s capacity. The Spanish Insolvency Act provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following
either the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor or the liquidation of the
debtor. An insolvency proceeding can also conclude: (i) at any moment when it is verified that there are
insufficient assets to pay post-insolvency debt; (ii) at any moment when it is verified that all of the credits
have been paid, or the situation of the insolvency does no longer exist; or (iii) when it is verified that all of
the creditors have waived their credit rights.

**_Voluntary Insolvency_**

If the debtor requests the insolvency, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency: a situation in
which the debtor cannot meet its financial obligations consistently and on time, including obligations not
yet due. The debtor is obligated to file a petition for a declaration of insolvency within two months after it
becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts
as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its state of insolvency, unless otherwise
proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for compulsory insolvency occur.
In the event of the debtor failing to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law
(two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by a bankruptcy authority once
the bankruptcy is declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) it may be unable to exercise certain
courses of action (including, among others, the possibility of submitting a proposed settlement in advance)
and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the declaration of
insolvency, should the debtor be liquidated and bankruptcy be classified as “guilty.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months
does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors
to obtain support to reach a pre-packaged composition agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado); or
an out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de refinanciación) set out in articles 583 et
seq. (“notice of negotiation with creditors”) and articles 597 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act.
Effectively, by means of the notice of negotiation with creditors of articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish
Insolvency Act, the debtor gains an additional three-month period to achieve an agreement with its
creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement and one further month to file
for the declaration of insolvency, if after the above-mentioned period of three months has elapsed without
an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of time, creditors’
petitions for mandatory insolvency will not be accepted. During the fourth month period: (i) the debtor has
the duty to file for insolvency, unless a pre-arranged composition agreement, a collective out of court
workout or an out of court repayment agreement is achieved (i.e. the company would gain four month
grace period to file for insolvency by a notice of negotiation with creditors); and (ii) the mandatory
petitions could be filed but would not be accepted if the debtor has filed a voluntary insolvency petition
(i.e. voluntary case filings have priority over involuntary ones within the fourth month grace period).
Likewise, the notice of negotiation with creditors prevents the commencement of court or out-of-court
enforcement actions and/or suspends (as applicable) existing enforcement actions, over assets or rights
which are necessary for the company’s business operations, other than those arising from public law claims
are prohibited, until any of the following circumstances occur: (i) a refinancing agreement set out in
Section 598 of the Spanish Insolvency Act is formalized; (ii) a court order is issued (providencia) accepting
for processing the court’s confirmation (homologación judicial) of admission of the refinancing agreement;
(iii) an out-of-court repayment agreement under article 631 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act is
entered into; (iv) the necessary accessions for the admission of a pre-arranged commencement agreement
are obtained; or (v) the declaration of insolvency takes place. In addition, enforcement proceedings that
have been brought by creditors holding financial claims (pasivos financieros), as defined in article 606 of
the Spanish Insolvency Law, shall be prohibited or suspended (as applicable) provided that it is evidenced
that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of
negotiations to enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement
proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating.
Nevertheless secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the
corresponding secured assets. However, if these secured assets are necessary for the continuity of the
debtor’s business or professional activity, once proceedings have been initiated they shall be immediately
suspended, until three months have elapsed from the date when the notice of negotiation with creditors is
filed. Financial securities and security interests over collateral located outside of Spain should not be
affected by the notice of negotiation with creditors.

**_Compulsory Insolvency_**

If a creditor requests the insolvency, it must provide evidence of the debtor’s insolvency in the terms
and by the means stated under Article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act such as: (i) a generalized default
on payments by the debtor; (ii) the occurrence of generalized attachments on the debtor’s assets; (iii) a
misplacement, “fire sale”, hasty or loss-making liquidation of assets; (iv) generalized default on certain tax,
social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three (3) months); (v)
there is a previous judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency of the debtor, provided that it is
firm; (vi) there is a title for which a writ of execution or constraint has been issued without the seizure
having resulted in known free assets sufficient for payment; or (vii) a seizure of assets affecting or
comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets. Upon receipt of an insolvency petition by a creditor, the
insolvency court may issue provisional interim measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a
guarantee from the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused
by the preliminary protective measures. The debtor will be entitled to file an opposition to such petition,
and will have to prove that it is not insolvent. The court will then summon the parties to a hearing, and will
finally render a court ruling either dismissing the application filed by the creditor, or declaring the
insolvency of the debtor.

_Effects of the Insolvency for the Debtor_

If the insolvency is voluntary, as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor usually
retains its powers to manage and dispose of its business, albeit under supervision by the insolvency
receivers (administración concursal) who is appointed by the court (intervention regime). If the insolvency
is compulsory, as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, then the debtor is removed from its
power over its assets, which become subject to management by the insolvency receivers implying that the
debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management’s powers (including the power to dispose of
assets) are conferred solely upon the insolvency receivers (suspension regime). These situations may be
modified at any time by the competent court. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required
supervision of the insolvency receivers may be declared null and void unless ratified by the insolvency
receivers.

_Effects of the Insolvency on Contracts_

Under Article 156 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, all clauses that entitle any party to terminate an
agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency are deemed void. The declaration of
insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending performance by either the
insolvent or the other party, which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent
debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. However, the insolvency receivers (together with the
bankrupt or by their sole discretion if the bankrupt is not allowed to carry on its business) may request the
court to terminate the relevant contract (on the grounds of convenience in the insolvency proceedings
(resolución del contrato en interés del concurso), or terminate for breach at the request of the non-insolvent
party if there has been a breach of such contract). The termination of such contracts may result in the
insolvent debtor having to return consideration received or indemnify its counterparty against the
insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the
insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency administrator’s request (assumption) (mantenimiento del
_contrato en interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall have claim against the_
insolvency estate (pre-deductible claim from the estate).

There are cases in which the Spanish laws expressly allow to establish an agreement for termination in
the event of insolvency (e.g., agency laws or RDL 5/2005 (as defined below), applicable to financial
collateral, as defined therein).

Additionally, bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in
_rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in_
favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State
Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

In any event, setoff is prohibited unless the requirements for the setoff were satisfied prior to the
declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law that permits set-off.

_Effects on enforcement proceedings_

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court
declaration of insolvency (with the exception of certain actions conducted by public authorities that do not

363


-----

concern assets necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor).
Additionally, once the insolvency proceeding is declared open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial
enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected
coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued.

The enforcement of any security over certain assets or rights that are necessary for the continuation of
the commercial or professional activity of the debtor may not be commenced and the procedures already
initiated before the declaration of insolvency shall be suspended for one year since such declaration, unless
an arrangement of a composition agreement is reached, provided it does not affect such right. Enforcement
will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction
have been published.

(a) After such one-year moratorium without liquidation having started, a separated enforcement
could be instituted, so long as the secured creditor is not bound by a composition agreement
affecting its claim.

(b) Enforcement proceedings conducted before other courts or notary publics will be stayed within
this one-year period unless the insolvency court declares that the collateral is not necessary for
the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor.

When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or
business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of
the debtor’s assets and rights. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another
company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in
connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s
business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such
shares/quota shares does not bring about the termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts
with such subsidiary allowing the insolvent debtor to exploit such asset.

The above regime does not affect financial collateral foreseen under RDL 5/2005 (as defined below),
which shall be still enforceable, or where the collateral is located in another EU member state by the time
of insolvency declaration. If the collateral is located in a non-EU state by the time of insolvency
declaration, the automatic stay (if any) and, in general, the effects of the insolvency will be governed by the
insolvency law of the state where the collateral is located.

Pursuant to Articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, in order to protect the
interests of the debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings is
extended to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets
(whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law).

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings
which can have an effect on the insolvent estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to
financial collateral (as defined in RDL 5/2005) or collateral located in an EU state other the Spain or,
subject to local law, a third state). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and
creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency
proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures
affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law).

**_Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be subject to the_**
**_provisions of Spanish Procedural Law and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable), which may entail delays_**
**_in the enforcement. Please also refer to “—Enforcement of Security Interests governed by Spanish law” section_**
**_below._**

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

There is no automatic claw back by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings but instead the insolvency
administrator must expressly challenge those transactions that are considered detrimental (perjudiciales) to
the insolvency estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration,
even in the absence of fraudulent intent (transactions taking place four years before the insolvency
declaration are subject to the ordinary regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code). In
addition, creditors who have applied to exercise any claw back action (stating the specific action they aim
to contest or revoke and their grounds), shall be entitled to exercise such action if the insolvency

364


-----

administrator does not do so within the two months following their request. The Spanish Insolvency Act
does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage”. Damage does not refer to the intention of the
parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest or on the equality of treatment
among creditors. The Spanish Insolvency Act provides that the insolvency receivers may undertake clawback actions against acts that took place before the declaration of insolvency that are considered to be
detrimental to the insolvency estate as follows:

(a) actions carried out in the two years preceding the declaration of insolvency may be challenged,
even in the absence of fraudulent intention;

(b) such actions must be considered to be detrimental to the insolvency estate, which is presumed in
the following cases:

     - without admission proof to contrary: (i) actions of disposal for no consideration, exception for
ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso); or (ii) regarding payments or other actions cancelling
obligations falling due after the declaration of insolvency (unless they were secured); or

     - with admission of proof to the contrary: (i) in actions for valuable consideration carried out for
any party especially related to the debtor, (ii) granting of in rem security covering preexisting
debts or new debts incurred to cancel preexisting debts; or (iii) cancellation of secured
obligations falling due after the declaration of insolvency.

Otherwise, the damage must be proved by the person seeking rescission;

(a) under no circumstances can (i) actions carried out in the debtor’s ordinary course of professional
or entrepreneurial business and under market conditions, (ii) actions contemplated in the specific
legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative
instruments, and (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of
the labor authorities, be rescinded;

(b) some kinds of refinancing arrangements (acuerdos de refinanciación) meeting certain legal
requirements set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act, as well as the security created in connection
therewith, may not be rescinded; and

(c) where the party who benefits from the act detrimental to the insolvency estate proves that such
act is subject to the law of another State that does not allow its challenge in any case, the act will
not be set aside.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to article 16 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, and
article 730 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law
will not be subject to claw back actions if such act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any
means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e., not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant
non-Spanish applicable laws. Procedurally, there is no safe harbor against a lawsuit being filed and
creditors being served to appear before Spanish courts, but the lawsuit should be dismissed on the merits if
creditors prove (i) that the act or transaction at issue is subject to foreign law and (ii) that such act or
transaction is unavoidable under the circumstances pursuant to that foreign law.

**_Request of joint insolvency_**

The insolvency of a company forming part of a group of companies, including the parent company,
does not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group. As stated above, a
company is insolvent when it cannot regularly meet its payment obligations as they fall due.

Notwithstanding the above, creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its
debtors (declaración conjunta de concursos) if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or
(b) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two
or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the
affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the
companies themselves provided that they form part of the same group.

Any of the insolvent debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the
procedural consolidation of insolvency proceedings already declared (acumulación de concursus) under
certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of
companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural consolidation of the insolvency
proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among

365


-----

them, or (b) they form part of the same group of companies, provided that a petition has not been
submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator pursuant to article 41 of the
Spanish Insolvency Act.

Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in coordination, without
consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency”
does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the
creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group
(except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be subordinated). The current
system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient
as possible. However, exceptionally, and for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report, by the
insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be
consolidated where there is a confusion of states and assets and liabilities belonging to each of the
companies cannot be identified, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay.

In any event, set-off is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the
declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent is governed by a law that permits set-off.

_Rules on Priority of Creditors_

Under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the ranking of claims determines the order of payment of credits.
The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them
within a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Boletín
_Oficial del Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original_
documentation that justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held
by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them
according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims benefiting from special
privileges; (ii) claims benefiting from general privileges; (iii) ordinary claims; and (iv) subordinated claims.

As for secured claims (those secured with in rem security interests) the Spanish Insolvency Act gives
them the status of creditors with special privilege, because the law includes in such category those in which
the collateral is comprised of specific property or rights (mortgage, pledge or antichresis) or equivalent
rights (financial lease agreement for the leased property). Certain limited exceptions may, however, exist
to this general rule (e.g., restrictions in article 271 of the Spanish Insolvency Act regarding pledges over
future credit rights). An in rem secured creditor is secured (for the purposes of insolvency) for the value of
the asset subject of the security (and such value will be calculated taking into account the rules set forth
under the Spanish Insolvency Act in order to determine its “reasonable value”) and will be deemed to be
unsecured (or ordinary) for the rest.

Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) are paid pro rata once the estate
claims and both generally and specially privileged claims have been paid.

Subordinated claims is a category of claims which includes, among others: credits communicated late
(outside the specific one-month period mentioned above); credits which are contractually subordinated
vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating to unpaid interest claims (including default
interest), except for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security interest; fines;
and claims of creditors which are “specially related parties” to the insolvent debtor. Subordinated creditors
are second-level creditors. They do not have voting rights on the composition agreement (as described
below) but are subject to its terms, being paid once ordinary claims are satisfied pursuant to the terms of
the agreement. Thus, subordinated creditors have limited chances of collecting payment according to the
ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act.

As an exception to the subordination regime, new financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a
refinancing agreement regulated under articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, which also
contemplates a capitalization of credit rights before the granting of new financing, shall not be classified as
a subordinated claim under Article 281 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, provided that the
requirements set out in Article 283 of the Spanish Insolvency Law are met. This is an incentive to promote
refinancing and capitalization of credit rights.

Moreover, as a consequence of the of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Act 3/2020, of
September 18 (in force as of September 20, 2020) has enhanced the position of certain “specially related
parties” in order to solve situations of lack of liquidity. Accordingly, in insolvency proceedings declared on
or before March 14, 2022: (i) financing granted by specially related parties; or (ii) financing in which they

366


-----

have been subrogated as creditors because of due payment (e.g., as a result of the enforcement of a
personal guarantee, resulting in a claim of the guarantor vis-à-vis the debtor) would not be subordinated,
but rather considered ordinary or privileged credit claims.

_Limitations to Enforcement by an Unsecured and Secured Creditor_

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court
declaration of insolvency. Unsecured creditors cannot initiate any enforcement proceedings against the
debtor company’s assets after the declaration of insolvency.

Notwithstanding the rules on priority mentioned in “—Rules on Priority of Creditors” above, in the
event of the debtor’s insolvency and in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act, the
ability of a secured creditor to enforce the collateral is limited if such collateral is considered necessary for
the debtor to continue its professional or business activities.

In such a case, the Spanish Insolvency Act imposes a moratorium on, the enforcement of secured
creditors’ rights in the event of insolvency, the enforcement of security may not be commenced until (i) a
composition is approved (the content of which does not affect this right) or (ii) one year elapses from the
insolvency declaration without liquidation taking place.

Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the
public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency
proceedings determines that the asset is not considered necessary for the debtor to continue its
professional or business activities. When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are
used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and
will likely include most of the debtor’s assets or rights.

Pursuant to the Spanish Insolvency Act, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and the
creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any
enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor
or administrative law).

Finally, enforcement of the security will be subject to the provisions of the Spanish Civil Procedure
Act (as defined below) and the Spanish Insolvency Act (where applicable) and this may entail delays in the
enforcement.

_Settlement or composition agreement_

Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Act encourages
creditors to reach an agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. This agreement may be
proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors whose credits exceed a fifth of all claims (masa pasiva),
and it shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, this
agreement must be honoured by the debtor and respected by the creditors.

The settlement or composition should contain proposals for write-offs and stays for a shorter period
than 10 years. Article 317 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act provides that it may also contain alternative
or complementary proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for Public Law
creditors), including conversion of debt into shares, into profit-sharing credits convertible bonds or
subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include
proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets related to the debtor’s business activity to a specific
person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined
in the settlement.

The proposals in the settlement shall include a payment schedule in accordance with article 331 of the
Spanish Insolvency Act.

In order for a settlement or composition to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following
majorities shall be met at the creditors’ meeting:

(a) In case the composition agreement contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of
the claims; to stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a
period not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public
administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans over
the same period, at least 50% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) have voted in favor of

367


-----

such settlement or composition. Notwithstanding the above, a vote by creditors representing a
portion of the unsecured liabilities that is greater than the vote against will suffice when the
settlement consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not
exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary unsecured claims
applying a write off of less than 20%.

(b) In case the composition agreement contains stays of between five and ten years; write-offs of
more than 50% of the amount of the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related
to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit
participating loans over the same period and any other proposal under article 317 et seq. of the
Spanish Insolvency Act, 65% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) should have voted for
the settlement or composition.

The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor
are not entitled to vote.

Although in principle secured creditors are not subject to an approved settlement or composition
(unless they have expressly voted in its favor) the effects of an approved composition can be extended to
secured and privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition of creditors has been approved by
the following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (Public Law creditors, financial
creditors or others):

(c) In case the composition agreement contains the full payment of the claims within a period not
exceeding three years or the immediate payment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write
off of less than 20%, a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of
the claims, stays for a period no longer than five years or conversion of debt into profit
participating loans, also for a period no longer than five years, at least 60% of privileged creditors
have voted in favor; and

(d) In case the composition agreement contains a write-off of more than 50% of the claim; stays (for
a period between five and 10 years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a
period between five and 10 years, and any other proposal under article 317 et seq. of the
Insolvency Act, at least 75% of privileged creditors have voted in favor.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is conceived as an outcome subsidiary to settlement. It operates where a composition is
not reached or when it is decided upon by the insolvency court. The insolvent must file a petition for
liquidation if, during the period while the settlement is in force, it becomes aware of no longer being able
to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of such settlement. In
such a case, if the debtor does not file a petition for liquidation while the composition agreement is in
force, any creditor may file such petition based on article 407.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Therefore,
the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed. Deferred
credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits.

The insolvency administration will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by
the insolvency court. The insolvency administration is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and
has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint a
different insolvency administration.

**_Termination of the insolvency proceedings_**

Article 465.6º of the Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency
proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been
entirely satisfied by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment
obligations regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that Article 473 of the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees the termination of
the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as
no future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment
of the proceeding as guilty.

**_Special regimes for certain refinancing agreements:_**

(a) Refinancing agreements that fulfill the following conditions cannot be rescinded except at the
request of the insolvency administration and under certain circumstances (namely, that the

368


-----

refinancing agreement lacks the formal requirements set forth below) and save in the case of
fraud: (i) the refinancing agreement gives rise to a “significant increase” in the funds available to
the borrower, or a modification of the terms of the initial financing by extending the maturity
date or by replacing the existing obligations with new ones, provided that they meet a viability
plan that allows the continuity of the debtor’s business in the short and medium term; (ii) the
agreement has been entered into with creditors whose credits represent at least 60% of the
debtor’s liabilities as of the date of the agreement; (iii) a certification is issued by the auditors of
the debtor, on the sufficiency of the liabilities required to adopt the agreement; and (iv) the
refinancing agreement and the documents substantiating performance of conditions (ii) to (iii)
above are executed by way of a Spanish public deed.

(b) Together with the refinancing agreements described above, no action for rescission will be either
available (save in case of fraud or because the formal criteria have not been met) for those
refinancing agreements that meet all the following criteria: (i) the ratio of assets to liabilities is
greater under the refinancing agreement than before the agreement took effect; (ii) the resulting
current assets are equal to or higher than the then current liabilities prior to reaching that private
agreement; (iii) the value of the security that would be provided to the relevant creditors does not
exceed either 90% of the value of the debt owed to those creditors, or the ratio of security to
outstanding debt that the creditors had the benefit of prior to the agreement taking effect;
(iv) the rate of interest relating to the debt under the refinancing agreement for the creditors
concerned is no more than one third of the rate applicable to the debt before the refinancing; and
the agreement has been executed as a Spanish public deed by all parties concerned.

(c) In addition, certain refinancing agreements (those that have been approved by at least 51% of
the financial creditors and meet the criteria under (a) above other than (ii)) may be sanctioned by
the court (homologación judicial) and be imposed to certain dissenting creditors:

     - all those creditors that have a financial claim against the debtor, irrespective of whether they
are subject to financial supervision or not;

     - any other creditors that have voluntarily signed up to the refinancing agreement, with the
exception of commercial and public sector creditors; and

     - secured creditors in certain circumstances (generally, when certain majorities of secured
creditors have voted in favor of the refinancing agreement).

The majorities required for the courts to sanction a refinancing agreement vary depending on whether
the financial liabilities concerned are secured or non-secured and on the effects to be imposed on
non-participating or dissenting creditors with the court’s approval.

_Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements_

In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements can be judicially sanctioned
(homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential bankruptcy
proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing
agreements, if (i) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure
by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones with longer maturity dates;
(ii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the
debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish
Recast Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions in
order to calculate whether the required thresholds are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement;
(iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached
(in the case of a group a companies, pursuant to certain precedents, the majority arguably refers both
individually to each company and to the group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not taken
into account-), and when the company has no auditor, by the one appointed for this purpose; and (iv) the
agreement is formalized in a public instrument and the documents that validate its content must be
attached. Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements will not be subject to the bankruptcy claw-back
action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law.

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding
an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is
favourably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so
established in the syndicated loan agreement. Whether or not the effects beyond those provided by the law

or object to homologation, and whether they have standing to object to homologation can be applied to
dissenting creditors, is controversial.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on
(i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the
extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to
be valued in accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act
and (ii) dissenting secured creditors in respect of their secured claims, provided they achieve the
thresholds mentioned below:

(a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least
60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or
the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos participativos) of term up
to five years.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured
claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of
the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) stays of payments for up to ten years;

(ii) haircuts;

(iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing
agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may
choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or, as default
option, (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share
premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a
consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap;

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations,
subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a
ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt
(datio pro solute or datio pro solvendo).

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured
claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to the insolvency claw-back action, the insolvency administrator and
any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement within four years (acción rescisoria
_pauliana) against the debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided_
that the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the
amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the
following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

   - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place
after such debt was created;

   - the debtor has carried our an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

   - such act was fraudulent;

   - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

   - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements
under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw back actions where the

370


-----

subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil
Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers
for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or
whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered
fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (i.e., it cannot be
rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption
(i.e., it is a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that,
the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the
consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third
party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

**_Temporary special insolvency provisions enacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic_**

The effects and impact derived from the COVID-19 pandemic have led the Spanish Government to
enact a series of regulations that introduce or establish certain temporary measures in the field of
insolvency law aimed at the preservation of the Spanish business tissue and the creation of a stable
restructuring scenario. These regulations include, mainly, Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17 (Real
_Decreto-ley 8/2020, de 17 de marzo, de medidas urgentes extraordinarias para hacer frente al impacto_
_económico y social del COVID-19), Royal Decree-Law 16/2020, of April 28 (Real Decreto-ley 16/2020, de 28_
_de abril, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la_
_Administración de Justicia), which was repealed by and its relevant provisions incorporated in Act 3/2020,_
and Royal Decree-Law 34/2020 (altogether, the “COVID-19 Regulations”) and which have stayed the
obligation to file for insolvency, currently until December 31, 2021 (please note that despite their
obligation having been stayed, the directors still have the right to file for insolvency upon current or
imminent insolvency and they could be held responsible for worsening the insolvency situation during that
period). Among other measures related to debtors which have already filed for insolvency or subject to
opened insolvency proceedings or which have entered into composition agreements or refinancing scheme
agreements before the enactment of the COVID-19 Regulations, the main measures related to insolvency
law introduced by the COVID-19 Regulations summarily include:

  - Insolvency moratorium: the COVID-19 Regulations entailed the introduction and subsequent
extensions of an exemption for directors in relation to their duty to file for insolvency irrespective of
whether they have notified the court of the initiation of negotiations for debt restructuring with
creditors.

   - New money provided by specially related persons: the COVID-19 Regulations set forth that as
regards insolvency proceedings declared within two years of the declaration of the first state of
alarm (estado de alarma) in Spain (i.e. March 14, 2020), new money provided by specially related
persons and any claims in which such specially related person is subrogated after such date will have
the consideration of ordinary claims, thus not subordinated.

  - Insolvency proceedings and liquidation plans: the COVID-19 Regulations introduced different
measures to accelerate insolvency proceedings. In relation to those insolvency proceedings opened
within two years of the declaration of the first state of alarm (estado de alarma) in Spain (i.e.
March 14, 2020), challenges against the list of creditors or assets (inventario) will need to be
sustained on documentary or expert evidence (prueba pericial). In relation to those insolvency
proceedings already opened at the date of declaration of the state of alarm (estado de alarma) or
those opened in the following year, and subject to certain exceptions, all auctions shall be out of
court auctions (subastas extrajudiciales). Finally, as a general measure, the approval of liquidation
plans has been expedited.

**_Winding-up as a consequence of 2020 losses._**

The COVID-19 Regulations established that, for the purposes of the events in which a company must
be wound-up as a consequence of losses by virtue of article 363.1 e) of the Spanish Companies Act (Ley de
_Sociedades de Capital) (the “Spanish Companies Act”), losses attributable to 2020 results will not be taken_
into account. Nevertheless, if 2021 results reveal that the company must be wound-up, this being that losses
reduce the such company’s net worth to an amount lower than half of its share capital, then administrators
must call a general shareholders’ meeting to proceed to the dissolution of such company or remediate the
winding-up situation.

**_Limitation on validity and enforcement of guarantees granted by any Spanish subsidiary_**

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a
primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the
guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity
or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. In the event that the guarantor or security
provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish
courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or
security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced
in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements
governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement,
waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default
were of minimal importance (provided that the parties to the agreement had not specifically provided that
certain breaches -no matter how objectively non-material- could give rise to acceleration). To be
recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be considered
material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to
the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (5 years being the general term established for
obligations in personam under article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code) or may be or become subject to the
defense of set-off or counterclaim. In addition, article 1,851 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an
extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the
guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the original term, although case law has established exceptions
where the extension benefits both the debtor and the guarantor).

A guarantee such as the guarantee granted by the Spanish Guarantor will be null if the obligations it
secures are declared null. The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be
required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that
are less favourable than those applying to the principal debtor.

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any
combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant
documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will
necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement
before the courts will in any event be subject to:

   - the nature of the remedies available in the courts;

   - Spanish public policy (overriding mandatory provisions);

   - The availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived),
circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho),
misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, statute of limitations, undue
influence, fraud, duress, abatement and counter-claim; and

   - The obligations under Guarantees granted by the Spanish Guarantor in the form of a sociedad
_anónima shall (i) not extend to any obligation incurred by any company of the Group for the_
purposes of (a) acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares
representing the share capital of the holding company of such Spanish Guarantor (or, in case of
private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), also shares representing
the share capital of any entity of its group); or (b) refinancing a previous debt incurred by any
company of the Group for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish
Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of the holding company of such Spanish
Guarantor (or, in case of private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada),
also shares representing the share capital of any entity of its group), and shall (ii) be deemed not to
be undertaken or incurred by a Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute
unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 (for Spanish public limited
companies (sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for the Spanish private limited liability companies
(sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) of the Spanish Companies Act, and, in no case, can any of
the Notes Guarantees or security interests given by a Spanish Guarantor secure repayment of the
above- mentioned funds.

372


-----

For the purposes of the paragraph above, a reference to a “holding company” of a Spanish Guarantor
shall mean the company which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish
Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that
one company has a dominant influence on another company when any of the scenarios set out in section 1
of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met or when at least half plus one
of the members of the managing body of the Spanish guarantor are also members of the managing body or
top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such
dominant company.

In addition, a reference to the “group” of each Spanish guarantor shall mean the group of companies
that have in common the same parent company (as this term is described above).

In addition, Article 158 the Spanish Companies Act provides that the financial assistance restrictions
referred to above in relation to transactions targeting shares of a Spanish parent company shall also be
applicable to its non-Spanish subsidiaries carrying out such transactions.

In accordance with the abovementioned, the guarantees and security interests granted by Spanish
companies belonging to the same group, shall not guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if
guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles
143.2 and/or 150 of the Spanish Companies Act.

Additionally, the obligations under Guarantees granted by the Spanish Guarantor in the form of a
_sociedad de responsabilidad limitada shall not include any obligations or liabilities which, if incurred, would_
constitute a breach of article 401 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act, as interpreted by Spanish courts.

  - Where payments under the Notes Guarantees cause the amount of such Spanish subsidiary’s net
assets (patrimonio neto) to fall below half the amount of its stated share capital, the Spanish
subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in
the required amount, and provided it is not required to declare its insolvency.

  - Guarantees given or created by a Spanish subsidiary may be deemed null and void under Spanish
law in the event that all or part of the Issuers’ obligations under the Notes which are guaranteed or
secured by virtue of such guarantees are null or void, and may be affected by any amendment,
supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the Issuers’ obligations under the Notes.

   - Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure
other group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or
security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not
able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate interest benefit for the guarantor
to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to
pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the
granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s
estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the
guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law
recognizes the interest of the group and, hence, the validity of upstream guarantees.

   - If the beneficiary of a guarantee adhered to or votes in favor of a debtor’s refinancing agreement or
commencement agreement (which contains haircuts), the guarantor shall be able to reduce its
liability to the same extent, unless otherwise expressly agreed.

**_Set-off_**

The Spanish Insolvency Act generally prohibits set-off of the credits and debts of the insolvent
company once it has been declared insolvent, but such set-off whose operating requirements were met
before the declaration of insolvency can still apply. However, setoff may be exercised by a determined
creditor vis-`a-vis the insolvent company if the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent
company permits it under insolvency scenarios.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests governed by Spanish law_**

The enforcement in Spain of security interests governed by Spanish law will be subject to Spanish
rules of civil in-court and out-of-court procedure (including, but not limited to, the Civil Procedure Act
1/2000 of 7 January (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil) as amended from time to time (the
“Spanish Civil Procedure Act”) and the Royal Decree-Law 5/2005, of 11 March (Real Decreto-ley 5/2005,

373


-----

_de 11 de marzo, de reformas urgentes para el impulso a la productividad y para la mejora de la contratación_
_pública) which implemented in Spain the EU Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the_
Council of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (“RDL 5/2005”).

The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as described in
the Notary Public Law of May 28, 1862 (Ley del Notariado de 28 de mayo de 1862) (the “Notarial Law”)
was significantly amended by Law 15/2015 of July 2, 2015 on Voluntary Jurisdiction (Ley 15/2015, de 2 de
_julio, de la Jurisdicción Voluntaria) (“Law 15/2015”). There is a high degree of uncertainty on this new legal_
framework given that some provisions of the Notarial Law seem to conflict with laws regarding the
enforcement of pledges that were not expressly repealed by Law 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of
these types of auctions are open to interpretation. Amendments to the Notarial Law brought about by Law
15/2015 entered into force on October 15, 2015 and there are no leading precedents as of the date hereof
that clarify how Law 15/2015 should be applied in practice. Consequently, the clauses in the pledge
agreements governing auctions organized by notaries may not be enforceable in accordance with their own
terms.

When enforcing security interests governed by Spanish law, the following particularities shall be taken
into account:

   - if the principal obligation is to be complied with in a jurisdiction other than Spain, it may not be
enforceable in Spain to the extent that compliance therewith would be illegal under the laws of the
primary jurisdiction, in which circumstances any collateral securing that principal obligation in
Spain may also become unenforceable.

   - the term “enforceable” means that the obligations assumed by the parties are of a type that the
Spanish courts enforce. It does not mean that those obligations will necessarily be enforced in all
circumstances in accordance with their terms.

   - although Spanish law does not expressly recognize the existence of two or more pledges over the
same asset, the existence of two or more pledges over the same assets has become a market practice
in Spain and is accepted by the majority of legal scholars although no case law has supported the
enforceability of such pledges and it cannot be disregarded that a court could take a different view
and consider such pledges inefficient and not admissible in Spain.

   - a Spanish court or a Spanish notary may not accept an enforcement of security interests governed
by Spanish law in respect of the secured documents based on the breach of obligations,
undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main payment
undertakings.

   - Spanish law does not protect the abusive exercise of rights (i.e., against such an agreement’s
purpose and prejudicing third parties) or arbitrary decisions or determinations by one of the parties.
Accordingly, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold the termination of an agreement based on an
unreasonable, inequitable or bad faith interpretation of one of its events of default or on the breach
of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main
payment undertakings of the secured documents.

   - enforceability of any Spanish security documents’ provisions relating to application of enforcement
proceeds will be subject to mandatory Spanish law requirements on the order of distributions.

   - if a transaction is performed in formal compliance with a Spanish law requirement, but the actual
intention is to cover another transaction, a Spanish court will apply the law governing the
transaction that was meant to be covered.

  - under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred or may be or become subject to the defense of
set-off or counterclaim, abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure,
unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress or error.

   - as regards ordinary pledges (as opposed to pledges without transfer of possession), the Spanish
Civil Code requires that the pledgor is deprived of the possession of the pledged asset. Such
transfer of possession is a requirement for the valid creation of the ordinary pledge. When the
pledge is a pledge over credit rights, which is not regulated by the Spanish Civil Code but generally
admitted by scholars and case law, the question is if the actual transfer of possession is substituted
by the notice of the creation of the pledge to the debtor of the pledged credit right. article 271.2 of
the Spanish Insolvency Act admits a special privilege to pledges over credit rights if such pledge is

374


-----

contained in a document with true date (fecha fehaciente)—normally notarial document—without
making any reference about the need of the notice to the debtor for the valid creation of the pledge
over credit rights. Notwithstanding this, the practical effect of not notifying the creation of the
pledge to the debtor is that, if such debtor effectively pays the credit to its creditor ignoring the
existence of the pledge over the credit right, any such payment will have release effects (efectos
_liberatorios) for the debtor and the pledgee will not have recourse against it._

- Spanish law does not regulate expressly, with respect to claims deriving from proceeds obtained
through a bond issuance, that security interests may be created only for the benefit of a secured
notes trustee. Further, evidence of any potential replacement of the entity acting as secured notes
trustee in its position as such will need to be recorded at the relevant Spanish public registry prior to
the commencement of any enforcement proceedings if the security was registered at a Spanish
public registry in favor of the secured notes trustee.

- the enforcement by Spanish courts of any final judgement for a sum of money in relation to the
secured documents obtained against the Spanish Guarantor in any court outside of Spain may be
limited by the provisions of Spanish principles of public policy (“orden público”). Moreover, the
Spanish courts may refuse to apply a provision of the law of the United States if application of that
provision would be manifestly incompatible with Spanish public policy (“orden público”).

- under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provisions whenever said
acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in
circumvention of law (“fraude de ley”) and the provisions whose application was intended to be
avoided shall apply.

- in accordance with the general principles of Spanish Civil Procedural laws, the rules of evidence in
any judicial proceeding cannot be modified by agreement of the parties. Accordingly, provisions in
an agreement in which determinations by a party are to be deemed to be conclusive would not be
upheld by a Spanish court. A determination, designation, calculation or certificate from one party
as to any matter provided in the secured documents might, in certain circumstances, be held by a
Spanish court not to be final, conclusive and binding, if it could be shown to have an unreasonable
or arbitrary basis or in the event of manifest error despite any provision in the secured documents
to the contrary.

- Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left to the
discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and
enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the
contracting parties.

- Spanish law limits the enforcement of fixed penalty provisions contained in agreements, allowing
the courts to reduce the amount of the penalty payable.

- it is not beyond doubt that the entity acting as secured notes trustee may validly establish a
liquidated sum in respect of a claim in a proceeding for the enforcement of security interests
governed by Spanish law in accordance with the procedure established in article 572.2 of the
Spanish Civil Procedure Act because the secured documentation does not qualify as self-executing
documents under Spanish law and, to the best of our knowledge, the Spanish courts have not
handed down a judgment in relation to the applicability of said article to agreements governed by a
law other than the Spanish law. Therefore, it may not be disregarded that the enforcement of the
Spanish security could require that a judgment be rendered in New York establishing the default in
respect of the secured obligations and the liquid amount payable thereunder which would then be
recognized and enforced in Spain over the assets subject to such Spanish security.

- under Spanish law, nullity or termination of the principal obligation will entail nullity or termination
of collateral obligations securing it.

- it is not entirely clear whether RDL 5/2005, would apply to Spanish law security interest securing
the Notes. In such case, the enforcement provisions contained therein referred to RDL 5/2005
would not be effective although such security interests could be enforced through any of the other
enforcement proceedings permitted by the Spanish law and contemplated in the relevant provisions
included in such security interests.

- a certified translation into Spanish by an official translator of any document not executed in Spanish
will be required to make such document admissible in evidence in Spain if a translation made by a
private translator is challenged by the party not having filed it.

375


-----

In addition, it should be noted that when granting security for existing debt within the two year
suspicious period set out in the Spanish Insolvency Act for example, on the basis of a promissory security
given at the time of obtaining such debt, there is a risk that security interests governed by Spanish law may
fall within the legal presumption of a harmful act to the debtor’s assets provided in article 226 et seq. of the
Spanish Insolvency Act and said security interests created may be challenged (please also refer to
“—Insolvency and Bankruptcy” and “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer”).

With regard to security interests governed by Spanish law that need to be registered within a Spanish
public registry, in addition to the above it should be noted that:

   - such security interests are only duly created as valid security interests, constituting and effective
security interest exercisable vis-à-vis third parties, when the notarial deed by which the security
interest is granted has been recorded at the relevant Spanish registry.

   - the competent Spanish registrar may refuse to register events of default or early termination events
stipulated in the secured documents thereunder (irrespective of their governing law) which may be
deemed contrary to the principles of Spanish law applicable to rights in rem over assets located in
Spain, such as events of default or early termination events based on the breach of obligations,
undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main payment
undertakings of the secured documents. In such case, a Spanish court or a Spanish notary would not
accept an enforcement of such security interest based on an event of default or early termination
event which has not been registered in the relevant Spanish public registry.

**_Trust, Trustee and Security Agent under Spanish law_**

Spanish law security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the Secured Parties
under the relevant security document and each secured party must accept said security interest either
entering into the relevant security documents themselves or duly represented by a Security Agent with
sufficient faculties to represent the secured creditors for such purposes.

Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concepts of “trust”, “trustee” or “security agent” and
there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a trustee or
security agent (including the Security Agent), whether this would cause delays in enforcement and the
consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements.
Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the
absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent
and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation. If Spanish-law security documents are
entered into only by the security agent and not also by the creditors on account of whom the security agent
or trustee would be acting, it can be argued that the security agent would be the only party entitled to
enforce the security interest in respect of those obligations, consequently, the security agent may only be
able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for
whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if such creditors grant due and express
powers of attorney in favor of the security agent duly notarized and legalized (and, if applicable, duly
apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in order to represent them in the
enforcement proceedings (nonetheless, this may not be effective in the case of judicial enforcement
proceedings, where one party cannot represent another by virtue of a power of attorney).

The holders of the Notes, from time to time, shall be the beneficial holders of any Spanish law security
interests. However, given that they will not be parties to the Spanish law security documents that will be
executed by the Security Agent on their behalf, the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they
are the direct beneficiaries of the security interests).

Although it could be argued that article 429 of the Spanish Companies Act (which allows the
representative of the syndicate of the holders of the Notes (comisario) to enforce any security interest on
behalf of all holders of the Notes under certain circumstances) could apply by analogy, it cannot be
disregarded that, if enforcement of the security interest is carried out by the Security Agent, it may be
necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of
a power of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the Secured Parties duly notarized
and, if not granted in Spain, with the apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961 or
legalized.

In the absence of the above-mentioned power of attorney, the Security Agent and/or Trustee, acting
as a security agent, may not be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security on behalf of all of the secured

376


-----

creditors (including the holders of the Notes). Furthermore, any beneficial holders of a security who have
not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) a
security agent to do so, may be treated as unsecured creditors under Spanish law, including, without
limitation, in an insolvency scenario.

In addition, the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may
eventually be enforced may request the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations
arise and the notarization of each and every transfer certificate relating to each and every transfer of the
Notes.

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties
through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured
parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor
is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does
not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent
the applicable Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The concept of “trust” and/or “parallel debt” (under, for example, the laws of the State of New York
or English law) is not recognized under Spanish law and, therefore, guarantees/security interests require
that the beneficiary of the guarantee/security interests and the creditor to be the same person. Such
guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured
claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. As mentioned above, if
Spanish law security documents are entered into only by the Security Agent (and not by the creditors on
account of whom it would be acting), the Security Agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the
guarantees or the security interest in respect of those obligations and it may only be able to do so in respect
of the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as
security agent unless such creditors grant the formal powers of attorney in its favor (duly notarized and
legalized or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in
order for the Security Agent represent them in any enforcement proceedings related to Spanish law
security documents.

Given that parallel debt structures have not yet been tested under Spanish law and we cannot assure
you that by creating any such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by
such applicable law. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests
created by the securities were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce the security.

Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the
securities or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator, the obligor itself or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or
clawback of Spanish insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of
transactions by the debtor.

**_Corporate benefit in cross-collateral security structures_**

A Spanish Guarantor will be creating the Spanish security as security of the Notes issued by a
company of the group receiving the financing under the Notes, so it can be argued whether such Spanish
Guarantor has obtained a corporate benefit for granting the relevant guarantee or collateral over its assets.

Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of ‘‘corporate benefit’’ expressly regulated under the
Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, however, Spanish lower courts, particularly
Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or
rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the
estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent
company and/or other companies of its group for the purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law (i.e. rescission or claw-back of these actions during the two year hardening period prior to
the date of declaration of insolvency, irrespective of the existence of fraudulent intent), when the
obligations guaranteed or secured does not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting
such guarantee or security interest.

Some decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of
such guarantees and security interests to the extent proof can be given that amounts can be borrowed

377


-----

directly by the company granting the guarantee or security interest or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made
available to such company under a intercompany loan agreement, equity contribution or similar
arrangement, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial
position of the group of companies to which such company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees,
indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and
financial conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in
accordance with Spanish case law existing as for the construction of the concept of ‘‘compensatory
advantage’’ (ventaja compensatoria).

However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and
compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the
insolvency court in the event of an insolvency scenario where the claims of the holders of the Notes,
particularly as ‘‘special privilege claims’’ may be challenged if the insolvency administrator or other
creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist.

**_Financial collateral_**

There is no consolidated case law on the application and interpretation of RDL 5/2005 with regard to
financial collateral and therefore it is not possible to predict the position a Spanish court would take or the
potential implications on the security interests of the Spanish Guarantor declaring insolvency. In
particular, as regards the scope ratione materiae of RDL 5/2005, the EU Court of Justice judgment dated
November 10, 2016 (Case 156/15), upholds a broad interpretation of the terms “principal obligation” and
“secured obligation” as used in Directive 2002/47, transposed into Spanish law under RDL 5/2005. Thus,
the Court considers that these terms must be considered to cover any obligation granting a right to cash
settlement. In Spain, to date, there has been no Supreme Court ruling in that regard. However, the
Barcelona Court of Appeal ruled in the same terms in its judgment of September 30, 2008.

**_Applicable Jurisdiction_**

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party
has its “centre of main interests.” This “centre of main interests” is deemed to be where the insolvent party
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third
parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “centre of main interests” are considered
“the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent
party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If
the “centre of main interests” is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in
Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency
proceedings”).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Act may
apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may
be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and
the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee
is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of
preference (excusión), order (orden) and division (división) apply.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to
purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes will be made
pursuant to a purchase agreement among, inter alios, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the
date of this Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). The obligations of the Initial Purchasers
under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are
several and not joint.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel. Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that
during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 45 days after the date the
Notes are issued, it will not, without having received prior written consent provided for in the Purchase
Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities issued or guaranteed by the
Issuer or such Guarantor and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and any hedging arrangements relating to the Notes).

Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not registered with the SEC as U.S. registered broker-dealers and
will effect offers and sales solely outside of the United States or within the United States to the extent
permitted by Rule 15a-6 through one or more U.S.-registered broker-dealers and as permitted by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regulations.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page
hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to
time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

The Initial Investors, members of the Group’s management and/or their respective affiliates may
place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price
set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes: (i) to non-U.S. persons outside the
United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S; and (ii) in the United States to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S and Rule 144A. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the
Notes, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the
offering of the Notes may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or
sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
Restrictions”.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
Offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply to list the
Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the Notes admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF Market thereof upon their issuance.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”).
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does
develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favorable to
you.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing
transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S.
Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position
for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying
security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve
purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover

379


-----

short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or
dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering
transaction to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price
of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to
engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given
as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
_Notes Guarantees—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes will be limited”._

The Initial Purchasers expect to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States
through their selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers
registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

  - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

   - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information
document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such securities is ECPs and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any
distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and
without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document
required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and

380


-----

professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturer’s
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member
State of the EEA or in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
and the UK Prospectus Regulation, respectively, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation
and the UK Prospectus Regulation.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the UK, by the Issuer or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See “Important Information”, “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions”.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act.
The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain fees and expenses
relating to the offering of the Notes.

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or
the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the
Notes.

**Initial Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the tenth U.K. or the ninth U.S.
business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the
date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10 U.K.” or “T+9 U.S.”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next seven U.K.
or six U.S. successive business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle
in T+10 U.K. or T+9 U.S., to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their
own advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies have engaged, and may
in the future engage, in lending, advisory, investment banking, corporate finance services, commercial
banking transactions and/or other commercial dealings with, and may provide services to, us and our
affiliates (including our parent and group companies), in the ordinary course of business. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, in the ordinary
course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent
companies may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and
for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve our securities
and/or instruments or those of our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and
parent companies that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us

381


-----

consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates and parent companies would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities,
including, potentially, the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of
the Notes and would bear the costs deriving from a possible (total or partial) cancellation of the bond
hedging swaps. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies may also
make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of
such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/
or short positions in such securities and instruments. They have received, and expect to receive, customary
fees and commissions for these transactions. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
were mandated lead arrangers, bookrunners, lenders or subparticipants under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility and certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers,
bookrunners, lenders or subparticipants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and such entities may act as
counterparties in the hedging arrangements in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the
Notes offered hereby, and have or will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. In
addition, each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have committed to fund a senior
secured bridge facility to provide financing for the Refinancing in the event the offering of the Notes is not
consummated, and such entities will receive customary fees in respect thereof.

Certain proceeds from the Offering will be used to repay all outstanding amounts due under the
Existing Notes, for which certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates acted as mandated lead
arrangers, underwriters and lenders. In connection with their services in such capacity, they have or will
receive customary fees and commissions.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_The following restrictions will apply to the Notes. Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to_
_consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the
Securities offered hereby are being offered and sold only to (i) QIBs (as defined in Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance
on Regulation S.

The Issuer uses the terms “offshore transaction”, “U.S. person” and “United States” with the
meanings given to them in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Each purchaser of Securities, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Securities are being offered for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and, unless so registered, may not be
offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption
therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144), nor acting on its behalf and that
either:

(a) a person in the United States or a U.S. person who is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule
144A and is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in reliance on Rule
144A, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) it is a non-U.S. person purchasing the Securities in an offshore transaction in accordance
with Regulation S and, if resident in a Member State of the European Economic Area or the
UK, it is a qualified investor (within the meaning of article 2(e) of regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (in the UK as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018)) and it is not a retail investor.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing any
of them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries or the
offer or sale of any of the Securities, other than the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum, which has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its
investment decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither the Initial
Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. It has had access to
such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Securities
that it deems necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including
an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any
state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject
to its or their ability to resell such Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not
subject to the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the
Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will be deemed
to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Securities prior to the date (the “Resale

383

**Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the**
later of the date of the original issue and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates
were the owner of such Securities (or any predecessor thereof) or, in the case of the Regulation S
Notes, 40 days after the later of the original issue date and the last date on which the Securities
were first offered to persons other than Distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S),
only (i) to the Issuer; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective
under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Securities are eligible for resale pursuant to
Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for
the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule
144A; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore
transactions in compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption
from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing
cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any
applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject
to the Issuer and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to
clause (v) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and other
information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a
certificate of transfer is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing
restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following
effect:

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer was incorporated as a società per azioni under the laws of the Republic of Italy. The
Guarantors are organized or incorporated (as applicable) under the laws of Australia, Mexico, The
Netherlands, Scotland and Spain. Substantially all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and
of each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside
the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a
Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities
under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore,
although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United
States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in
relation to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process on the Issuer or on such other persons as mentioned
above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against an Issuer, any Guarantor,
or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in
jurisdictions where the relevant Issuer or individual has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S.
court judgments outside the United States is described below for Italy, you should consult with your own
advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere
outside the United States.

See also “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**Italy**

We have been advised by counsel in Italy that the recognition and enforcement of a judgment
rendered by a U.S. federal or New York state court in Italy is governed by Article 64 of Italian Law
No. 218 of Mary 31, 1995 (Riforma del Sistema Italiana di diritto internazionale privato) (the “PIL Act”)
(and certain other provisions of the PIL Act).

Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court should
automatically be recognized in Italy provided that the following requirements are met:

   - the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court had appropriate jurisdiction to pass judgment
upon the matter (in accordance with the Italian law principles of jurisdiction);

   - the defendant had received the summons in accordance with the laws of the state in which the
proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived of his fundamental right to
a defense;

   - the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the
proceedings were conducted in absentia (in contumacia) in accordance with such local procedural
law;

   - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court must be final and binding
(passato in giudicato) according to the law of the state in which it was issued;

   - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in conflict with any earlier
final and binding judgment issued by an Italian court;

   - there is not pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and
between the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the
relevant U.S. federal or New York state court; and

   - the judgment rendered by the U.S. general or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public
policy.

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or
New York state court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such
judgment, a proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal to this end. The competent
Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the
requirements set out above (including that requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or
New York state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy).

389


-----

**Australia**

While the Australian Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) makes provision for the enforcement of
certain overseas judgments in Australia, the Australian Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) does not apply
to United States judgments.

In Australia, in order to enforce without a re-examination of the merits of the issues determined by
the proceedings, any final and conclusive judgment against an Australian Guarantor in a New York court
arising out of or in relation to the obligations of an Australian Guarantor under its Guarantee, which
judgment is for a fixed sum of money (and not being a sum in respect of taxes or in respect of a fine or
other penalty), certain conditions must be met, including (but not limited to) the following: in order for the
Australian Courts to enforce such a judgment, the party seeking the enforcement must bring a fresh action
on the foreign judgment in an appropriate Court in Australia; the proceedings in the New York court must
not have involved any denial of the principles of natural justice recognized by the Australian Courts; the
judgment must not be contrary to the public policy of the laws of Australia or the law of public policy of
the State of New York; the judgment must not be obtained by fraud or duress; the enforcement proceeding
must have been commenced within any applicable limitation periods and any procedural rules including in
relation to jurisdiction and service of process for commencement and maintenance of proceedings before
the New York court must have been observed; the judgment must not be wholly satisfied (and
enforcement must only be sought to the extent the judgment is not satisfied); the parties to the proceedings
of the New York court and to the enforcement proceedings must be identical; and the New York court
must have been jurisdictionally competent in hearing and determining the issue(s) concerned in the
judgment under the rules of private international law of Australia.

**Mexico**

_General_

Two of the Guarantors are Mexican companies. No treaty is currently in effect between the United
States and Mexico that covers the reciprocal enforcement of judgments issued in the other country.
Generally, Mexican courts would enforce final judgments rendered in the United States if, among other
things:

(a) such judgment is obtained in compliance with legal requirements of the jurisdiction of the court
rendering such judgment;

(b) all formalities set forth in treaties relating to foreign rogatory letters, to which Mexico is a party,
have been complied with;

(c) such judgment is not rendered in a real action (acción real);

(d) the court was competent to resolve the relevant matter in accordance with the rules of
international law compatible with those adopted by the Mexican Commerce Code (Código de
_Comercio);_

(e) service of process was made personally on the applicable party or on an appropriate process
agent thereof;

(f) such judgment is final in the jurisdiction where obtained and there is no recourse against it;

(g) such judgment and the obligation enforced through such judgment do not contravene Mexican
public policy or laws;

(h) the action in respect to which such judgment is rendered is not the subject matter of a lawsuit
among the same parties pending before a Mexican court;

(i) the applicable procedure under the laws of Mexico with respect to the enforcement of foreign
judgments (including the issuance of a letter rogatory by the competent authority of such
jurisdiction requesting enforcement of such judgment and the certification of such judgment as
authentic by the corresponding authorities of such jurisdiction in accordance with the laws
thereof) is complied with; and

(j) the courts of such jurisdiction recognize the principles of reciprocity in connection with the
enforcement of foreign judgments in such jurisdiction.

All or a substantial portion of each of the Mexican Guarantors’ assets are located and a majority of its
revenues are derived from sources outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for

390


-----

investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Mexican Guarantors or upon their
directors and executive officers that reside outside the United States, or to enforce against any of them in
U.S. courts judgments predicated upon the civil liabilities under the laws of jurisdictions other than
Mexico, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws
or other laws of the United States, judgments other than an obligation to pay money for a sum certain or
judgments that may contravene any Mexican law or public policy.

Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Mexican courts, of liabilities
predicated, in whole or in part, on U.S. federal securities laws and as to the enforceability in Mexican
courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S.
federal securities laws.

Further, any proceedings before Mexican courts are to be conducted in accordance with, and any
enforcement of judgments or awards in Mexico is subject to, Mexican rules and Mexican procedural law.
For instance:

(a) in any insolvency, concurso mercantil or bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, labor claims, claims of
tax authorities for unpaid taxes, social security quotas, workers’ housing fund quotas, retirement
fund quotas, litigation costs, fees and expenses related to the management of the bankruptcy
estate, creditors for the expenses incurred to cover ordinary protection expenses incurred for the
conservation, management or safety of the bankruptcy estate, expenses incurred in connection
with any judicial or extrajudicial procedure for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate, and other
claims provided under Mexico’s Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, will have priority over claims of
unsecured creditors;

(b) in the event of legal proceedings in the courts of Mexico, a Spanish translation of any document
not prepared or executed in the Spanish prepared by a court-appointed translator would have to
be approved by the court after the defendant had been given an opportunity to be heard as to the
accuracy of such translation, and proceedings would thereafter be based upon such translation; in
addition, in case of foreign public documents, legalization before the appropriate Mexican
consulate (or an apostille in lieu of such legalization) will be required;

(c) claims may become barred under statute of limitation rules in Mexico or may become subject to
defenses or set-off or counter claim; in any suit brought before Mexican courts, such courts will
apply statute of limitation rules;

(d) procedural rights and legal defense rights cannot be validly waived under Mexican law; and

(e) there are no self-help remedies recognized by Mexican law; the taking of possession, entry,
removal, sale, transfer or other disposition of property or similar action in Mexico may not be
made without judicial intervention and only after the defendant is given the right to be heard in
court and Mexican law provides that contractual obligations provided by the Mexican Guarantors
may only exist to the extent that the obligations of the principal obligor(s) are valid. Therefore,
upon the lack of genuineness, validity or enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes, the obligations of the Mexican Guarantors pursuant to its guarantee shall be equally
affected and, in such circumstance, the obligations provided for thereunder may be
unenforceable in Mexico.

In addition, under Mexican law, the extension or the granting of grace periods to the principal
obligor(s), any modification of guaranteed obligations that would increase any obligation of the Mexican
Guarantors pursuant to its guarantee, or the novation (novación) of the principal obligation, would require
the consent of the Mexican Guarantors. Therefore, the obligations of the Mexican Guarantors might not
be enforced by Mexican courts if the guaranteed obligations are extended, increased or novated (novadas)
without the consent of the Mexican Guarantors at that time.

_Service of process_

The Mexican Guarantors have appointed an agent to receive service of process with respect to any
action brought against any of them in any federal or state court in the State of New York arising from this
offering. Personal service of process, including service of process on a process agent is considered to be a
basic procedural requirement under Mexican law. Service of process in Mexico must be made in person to
be valid. If, for purposes of proceedings outside of Mexico, service of process is made by mail or other
method that is not personal, such service of process would not constitute personal service of process under
Mexican law. The courts of Mexico would not enforce a final judgment based on any such process. There

391


-----

are several conflicting non-binding judicial precedents that have analyzed whether service of process made at
the domicile of the agent for service of process should be considered as personal process on the party being
served and, as a result, no definitive and binding criteria has been set by the Mexican judiciary on this issue.

_Foreign currency_

In the event that proceedings are brought in Mexico seeking enforcement of the Mexican Guarantors’
obligations in Mexico, pursuant to article 8 of the Mexican Monetary Law (Ley Monetaria de los Estados
_Unidos Mexicanos), each of the Mexican Guarantors may discharge its obligations by paying any sums due_
in a foreign currency in Mexican pesos at the exchange rate for Mexican pesos applicable on the date on
which payment is made, as published by Mexico’s Central Bank (Banco de México). If the Mexican
Guarantors elect to make payments due on the Notes in Mexican pesos in accordance with the Mexican
Monetary Law, we can make no assurances that the amounts paid may be converted back by the payee into
U.S. dollars or euros at the same exchange rate or that, if converted, such amounts would be sufficient to
purchase U.S. dollars or euros equal to the amount of principal, interest or additional amounts due on the
Notes.

**The Netherlands**

There is no treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions (other
than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and The Netherlands.
Therefore, an executable judgment rendered by any competent court of New York, the United States
America based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities
laws, would not automatically be enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment that is
enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court and the
judgment rendered by the foreign court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case
the Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what extent it, given the circumstances of the case, will
recognize the foreign judgment. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same
judgment without relitigation analysis on the merits if the final judgment obtained in a competent court of
New York, the United States America, is not rendered by default, is not subject to appeal or other means
of contestation and is enforceable in the United States of America with respect to the payment of
obligations of a Dutch company (such as the Dutch Guarantor) under the documents expressed to be
subject to the laws of the State of New York (such as, inter alia, the Notes and the Indenture) and if (i) that
judgment has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the principles of due
justice, its contents and enforcement does not conflict with Dutch public policy (openbare orde) and it has
not been rendered in proceedings of a criminal law or revenue or other public law nature, (ii) the
jurisdiction of the competent court has been based on grounds that are internationally acceptable, (iii) the
judgment was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of
justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iv) the judgment is not incompatible
with a decision rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision rendered
between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the
same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in The Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable
treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from US federal or state courts. No assurance can be given, however, that these judgments will be
enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon US federal
securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in The
Netherlands will be subject to the applicable rules of civil procedure in The Netherlands. A Dutch court
has the authority to make an award in a foreign currency. However, enforcement against assets in The
Netherlands of a judgment for a sum of money expressed in foreign currency would be executed in Dutch
legal tender and the applicable rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

Enforcement of obligations before a Dutch court will be subject to the degree to which the relevant
obligations are enforceable under their governing law, to the nature of the remedies available in Dutch
courts, the acceptance by such courts of jurisdiction, the effect of provisions imposing prescription periods
and to the availability of defenses such as set off (unless validly waived) and counter-claim; specific
performance may not always be awarded. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to
stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being
brought elsewhere.

392


-----

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a US court and recognize damages only
to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

**Scotland**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Scotland
is based upon advice provided to us by our Scottish legal advisers. The United States and Scotland
currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as
opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for
payment rendered by any federal or state court in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable
in Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated
before a court of competent jurisdiction in Scotland. In such an action, a Scottish court would not generally
re-examine the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below).

An objection may be made against the recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Scottish
court on the following grounds:

   - the U.S. court lacked jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Scottish conflicts of
laws principles and rules of Scottish private international law;

   - the U.S. judgment was given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

   - the U.S. judgment is one to which section 32 of the Civil and Jurisdiction Judgments Act 1982
applies;

   - the U.S. judgment was not final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

   - the U.S. judgment contravened Scottish public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998;

   - the U.S. judgment is for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involves the enforcement of a non-Scottish penal or
revenue judgment;

   - the U.S. judgment is one to which section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 applies;

   - the U.S. judgment was obtained in proceedings which displayed a substantial degree of unfairness
or procedural irregularity, or was obtained by fraud or in breach of Scottish principles of natural
justice;

   - there is a prior inconsistent decision of a Scottish court in respect of the same matter involving the
same parties; or

   - the U.S. judgment is no longer extant or enforceable in the U.S. for example by reason of
prescription or limitation.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Scotland judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Scotland. In addition, it is questionable
whether a Scottish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was
commenced in Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws.

**Spain**

Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain and a significant portion of their assets are
located in Spain. As a result, any judgment based on civil liability obtained against the companies
incorporated in Spain rendered outside of Spain in a country which: (a) is not bound by the provisions of
EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters; and (b) is
not party to an international treaty providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments between
the countries where the judgements seeking for enforcement in Spain were rendered, would not be directly
recognized or enforceable in Spain in accordance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Civil
Procedure Act as amended (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuciamiento Civil) (the “Spanish Civil
**Procedure Act”) and subject to Law 29/2015, of July 30, 2015, on International Legal Cooperation in Civil**
Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil) (the “Law on
**International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”).**

393


-----

Accordingly, provided that the United States and Spain are not party to any international treaty
providing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, a judgment rendered by any U.S.
federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not be directly recognized or enforceable in Spain,
in accordance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and subject to the Law on
International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters. Such provisions set forth that any, in principle, final and
conclusive judgment rendered outside Spain may be enforced in Spain:

   - in accordance with the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence
between Spain and the United States for these purposes);

   - in the absence of any treaty, in those cases in which the relevant court from a foreign country which
is not a member bound by the provisions of the EU Regulation 1215/2012, if it meets the formal
requirements of (i) the relevant law from said foreign country and (ii) Spanish law, to be considered
authentic, i.e., enacted by an authorized court (in Spain it would be required, inter alia, that the
judgement is duly legalized or apostilled and translated into Spanish) and enforceable; and

   - if it does not fall within the circumstances set forth in article 46 of the Spanish International
Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, in particular:

(a) that the judgment breaches Spanish public order (“orden público”)’

(b) that the judgement is not final (i.e., subject to further appeal) and therefore is not an
enforceable nature (fuerza ejecutiva) in the foreign jurisdiction;

(c) that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching and rights of defense of any of the
parties (if a judgement has been rendered by default (“en rebeldía”) of the defendant it
would be deemed to breach his rights of defense if the defendant has not been regularly and
timely notified to enable him to defend himself properly);

(d) that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court
jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute;

(e) that the foreign judgment is incompatible with other Spanish judgements;

(f) that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgement which meets the
requirements to be enforceable in Spain;

(g) that there is an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same
subject which was opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings
before the foreign court; and

(h) the company is subject to an insolvency proceeding in Spain and the foreign judgment does
not meet the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law.

Article 48 of the Spanish Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits
that a foreign judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revision del fondo) by the Spanish competent court.
According to Article 3.2 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, the Spanish
Government may establish that the Spanish authorities will not cooperate with other country’s authorities
when there has been a reiteration refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by
such other country’s authorities.

Additionally, and according to Article 47 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters
Act, there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments
rendered in proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be recognized and enforced in Spain
insofar as they satisfy the conditions set forth therein.

The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain, which would not
directly be recognized or enforced in Spain, must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability
of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera
_Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) for which purpose the abovementioned_
requirements must be met.

394


-----

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount
due and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and
interest will be paid in euros.

A final and conclusive judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country
bound by the provisions of the EU Regulation 1215/2012 will be recognized and enforceable by the
Spanish courts, without review of its merits, once the judgment has been recognized under the exequatur
procedure.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain entails, among others, the following principal actions and
costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into
Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) payment of certain professional fees required for the
verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain (if needed); (c) certain court fees and or
judicial taxes must be paid, (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an
attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); (e) original or
authenticated copy of the judgment duly apostilled or legalized must be filed; (f) a document evidencing
the service of process in the event that the judgment was rendered in default of appearance must be filed;
and (g) evidence of the judgment being final and conclusive (firme) and executory must be filed. Under
Spanish law, the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. In addition, in
accordance with Article 1 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be
amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in the relevant agreement.

As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original action to
Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish Courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil
Procedure Act, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one judge
(juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish
Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is
competent to solve the corresponding dispute); however, this article does not expressly cover the validity of
nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.

If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law made by the parties may be rejected by
Spanish courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public policy (orden público) or it may not grant
enforcement in the event that they deem that a right has been exercised in such a manner to constitute an
abuse of right (abuso de derecho).

**Notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements**

**at March 31, 2021**

**GENERAL INFORMATION**

**(1) General information**

Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares set up under Italian law and registered with the
Alessandria company registrar. Its registered office is in via Rana 12, zona industriale D6, Spinetta
Marengo (Alessandria).

The Guala Closures Group’s main activities involve the design and manufacturing of closures for
spirits, wine and non-alcoholic beverages such as water, olive oil and vinegar to be sold mainly on
international markets.

The group is also active in the production of PET plastic preforms and bottles.

The group’s activities are separated into two divisions:

   - the Closures division, representing the group’s core business, specialised in the production of safety
closures, customised luxury closures, aluminium closures for wine, standard roll-on closures and
other closures;

   - the PET division, which produces PET bottles and miniatures. This division is no longer considered
a core business.

Currently, the group is the European and international leader in the production of safety closures for
spirits bottles, with over 60 years’ experience in the sector.

It is also the leading European producer of aluminium closures for spirits bottles.

**(2) Accounting policies**

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
IAS 34—Interim Financial Reporting as endorsed by the EU.

Except for that set out in the (3) “Changes to standards” section, the accounting policies applied to
prepare the condensed interim consolidated financial statements by all the group companies are the same
as those applied to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Guala Closures Group at
December 31, 2020, to which reference should be made.

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euros, rounding
the amounts to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies between the condensed interim consolidated
financial statements balances and those in the tables of these notes are due exclusively to the rounding and
do not alter their reliability or substance. Figures are shown in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise stated.

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost
basis, except for derivatives, market warrants and contingent consideration arising in a business
combination (i.e., the non-controlling investors’ put options) which are measured at fair value and
investments in associates which are measured using the equity method. They have been prepared on a
going concern basis. There are no business risks and/or any identified uncertainties which may cast doubts
on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements comprise the following schedules:

   - statement of profit or loss, whose captions are classified by nature;

   - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income ;

   - statement of financial position, whose asset and liability captions are classified as current or noncurrent;

   - statement of cash flows, prepared using the indirect method;

   - the statement of changes in equity, prepared to present changes in equity.

Starting with the condensed interim consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2020, the group has
changed the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income, dividing it into two schedules: the

F-10

**Notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at March 31, 2021**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

statement of profit or loss and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Comparative data for the same period of the previous year have been reclassified accordingly.

For each asset and liability caption including amounts due within and after one year, the amount
which is expected to be received or paid after one year is shown.

Pursuant to Consob (the Italian commission for listed companies and the stock exchange) resolution
no. 15519 of July 27, 2006 on financial statements, significant related party transactions and non-recurring
items have been indicated separately in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

In preparing the condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS,
management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. Estimates are used to recognise the loss allowance, the allowance for inventory writedown, current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale, depreciation/amortisation and impairment
losses on non-current assets, employee benefits, taxes, provisions, measurement of derivatives, market
warrants and measurement of the effects of business combinations.

In accordance with IAS 34—Interim Financial Reporting, the interim measurement of the figures of
the condensed interim consolidated financial statements may rely on a greater use on estimation methods
than annual consolidated financial statements. The measurement procedures carried out to this end ensure
the reliability of the information provided and that all material financial information necessary to
understand the group’s financial position and financial performance is provided.

The group companies are listed below, stating their name, registered office, reporting currency, share/
quota capital, direct and indirect investments held by the parent and the subsidiaries and associates and
the method of consolidation at March 31, 2021.

The average rates are used for the statement of profit or loss and the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income captions while the spot rates are used for the statement of financial position captions.

**(3) Changes to standards**

The new standards and/or amendments thereto applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on
or after January 1, 2021 are set out below.

  - Amendments to IFRS 4 (deferral of effective date of IFRS 9)

  - Interest rate benchmark reform—Phase 2 (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS
16): the amendments address issues that might affect financial reporting as a result of the reform of an
interest rate benchmark, including the effects of changes to contractual cash flows or the hedging
relationships arising from replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark
rate. The amendments provide practical relief from certain requirements of IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7,
IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to: changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of
financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities; and hedge accounting. The amendments will
require an entity to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a
financial asset or financial liability that is required by the interest rate benchmark reform by updating
the effective interest rate of the financial asset or liability.

At March 31, 2021, the group has a partly availed senior revolving credit facility in British pounds (of
which it has availed £11 million), accruing interest at the LIBOR and which will be subject to IBOR
reform. The group expects that no significant modification gains or losses will arise as a result of applying
the amendments to these changes.

The new standards and amendments are not expected to have any significant impacts on the
condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

In addition, the IASB has issued the following standards or amendments, approved or not yet
approved by the European Union with a deferred application date.

F-13

**Notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at March 31, 2021**

**(3) Changes to standards (Continued)**

New Standards:

  - IFRS 14—Regulatory deferral accounts

  - IFRS 17—Insurance contracts and Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance contracts

Amendments:

   - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
(Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)

  - Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3)

  - Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)

  - Onerous contracts—Costs of fulfilling a contract (Amendments to IAS 37)

  - Annual improvements to IFRS Standards (Cycle 2018–2020)

   - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1), including
subsequent amendment issued in July 2020.

These new documents, having a deferred date of entry into force, were not adopted for the
preparation of these interim consolidated financial statements, but will be applied starting from the date of
entry into force established as mandatory.

**(4) Operating segments**

Reportable segments are the group’s strategic divisions as determined in accordance with the
quantitative and qualitative requirements of IFRS 8.

The group has only one reportable segment, the Closures division which represents the Group’s core
business. The group’s top management (who are accountable for operating decisions) reviews internal
management reports on a monthly basis.

Other operations consist of the PET division which did not meet any of the quantitative thresholds for
determining reportable segments under IFRS 8 in the first three months of 2021.

Information regarding the results of the group’s reportable segment is included below. Performance is
measured based on segment revenue, profit (loss) before taxation, amortisation and depreciation, trade
receivables, inventories, trade payables, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and capital
expenditure as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the CEO and by the
board of directors.

Management considers the above information as the most suitable to evaluate the results of the
segment compared to other entities that operate in these industries.

Other asset and liability figures cannot be reported by segment as management believes that the
availability of such information by segment is not material.

**Information about key customers**

In the Closures segment, there are two customers that generated over 10% of revenue each in the first
quarter of 2021: the turnover of the first customer amounts to around €21 million for the first quarter of
2021 (roughly 15% of net revenue), while that of the second customer is approximately €15 million for the
same period of the previous year (roughly 11% of net revenue).

**(5) Acquisitions of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests**

During the period, the group finalised its subscription of a second non-controlling interest in
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd.

**(5.1) Subscription of another non-controlling interest in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd**

On February 26, 2020, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalised the
subscription of a 20% interest in the fully diluted share capital (including the option for the issue of stock
options) of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd, an innovative technology services agency based in London.

Founded in 2015 as the first IoT agency, SharpEnd is a pioneering partner in technological creativity.
This company was set up to bridge the gap between products and consumers and its global customers
include AB-InBev, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever and Pernod Ricard.

The agreement between SharpEnd and the Guala Closures Group aims to offer innovative turnkey
solutions, integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions.

The capital subscribed by converting the £250 thousand loan granted to the company in December
2019 and by paying £750 thousand in 2020 comprises preference shares accounting for 20% of the
company’s fully diluted share capital. Under the agreements reached, the Guala Closures Group can
increase its investment by subscribing specific capital increases and can also recover its investment.

The accruals to provisions mainly refer to the provisions for company reorganisations and returns.

Short-term leases, i.e., with a term of less than 12 months, and leases for which the underlying asset is
of low value, which have been excluded from the scope of IFRS 16 as per the practical expedient, are
recognised in the caption “Use of third-party assets” on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Market warrants are listed instruments which are recognised under current financial liabilities. The
financial expense related to their fair value refers to the change in the official price of these instruments
set by Borsa Italiana during the reporting period. An increase in the official price generates financial
expense (as in the first three months of 2021 while it was financial income in the corresponding period of
2020) since it results in an increase of the underlying financial liability.

Financial expense (or financial income) on non-controlling investors’ put options refers to the
recognition of the increase (or decrease) in the financial liabilities for these investors’ right to exercise a
put option if certain conditions are met. The liability was determined as the present value of the put option
at its expected time of exercise.

**(14) Financial expense (Continued)**

Other financial expense for the first quarter of 2021 includes €276 thousand related to the application
of IFRS 16 (€277 thousand in the corresponding period of 2020).

**(15) Income taxes**

Income taxes decreased by €1.5 million from €2.8 million in the first quarter of 2020 to €1.4 million in
the same period of 2021.

This reduction is attributable for € 1.1 million to the reduction in current taxes and for € 0.3 million to
the reduction in deferred taxes.

The reduction in current taxes in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020,
despite the increase in the pre-tax result, is mainly attributable to the reduction in taxes in the Group
companies in Eastern Europe and India due to the lower profitability of the period, while the increase in
the pre-tax result is attributable to some countries, including Italy, which benefit from the use of previous
losses.

The deferred tax assets recognized in the result for the period differ from the change in the
corresponding balance sheet items for transactions directly attributed to the other components of the
comprehensive income statement (OCI) (+€52 thousand).

   - 2,500,000 outstanding sponsor warrants,

  - 1,000,000 outstanding management warrants,

   - 812,500 outstanding special shares.

**(20) Investments in associates**

This caption amounts to €2.6 million at March 31, 2021 and is entirely comprised of the investment in
SharpEnd Partnership Ltd, an innovative technology services agency based in London (UK).

The €1.6 million increase on December 31, 2020 is due to the additional payment of £1,400 thousand
made in the reporting period to acquire an additional 10% of the associate’s fully diluted share capital in
the form of preference shares. As a result, the group’s investment increased to 30%.

Under the agreements reached, the Guala Closures Group can increase its investment by subscribing
specific capital increases and can also recover its investment.

The group impaired its investment by €0.1 million during the period in line with its share of the
associate’s loss for the three months.

**(21) Property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

Capex mainly refers to plant and machinery across all five continents where the group operates, with a
specific focus on the group’s main European facilities in Poland, Italy, Germany, Ukraine and Bulgaria, in
Indian facilities as well as its African facilities based in Kenya.

In Italy, capex was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, new product development and
extraordinary plant maintenance.

In Poland, capex mainly consisted of increasing production capacity.

In Ukraine, capex mainly consisted of increasing production capacity, plant safety and extraordinary
plant maintenance.

Furthermore, Europe saw capex for new product development at the facilities in Bulgaria and the
research centre in Luxembourg and for significant maintenance on plants in the UK and Ukraine.

In Asia, capex targeted, in particular, the Indian facilities for extraordinary plant maintenance and
new product development.

In Latam-US, the main capex focused on the Mexican facility with projects mainly for plant safety and
extraordinary maintenance. Smaller investments were also made in all the other facilities across the region.

In Africa, capex related to extraordinary maintenance on plants in South Africa and the increase in
production capacity at the facility in Kenya.

In Oceania, capex mainly focused on Australia where the group invested in making the production
process more efficient.

Property, plant and equipment include the cost of internal work capitalised.

The exchange gains for the period reflect the partial but generalised appreciation of the foreign
currencies with which the group operates against the Euro, which was the stronger currency in 2020.

At March 31, 2021, the collateral on property, plant and equipment is unchanged from that set out in
the relevant note to the 2020 consolidated financial statements.

This caption is substantially unchanged from December 31, 2020 as the amortisation of approximately
€4.7 million for the period is offset by the positive translation effect of roughly €4.3 million, due to the
partial but generalised appreciation of the foreign currencies with which the group operates against the
Euro, and the increase in assets under development and payments on account (€0.4 million).

Licences and patents mainly refer to the Guala Closures trademark and the group’s proprietary
patents, and Other mostly refers to business relationships with customers.

Goodwill arising on the PPA procedure for the business acquired in Germany is unchanged at
March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment. Since its recognition on July 31, 2018, goodwill
has never been impaired.

The group checks the recoverability of goodwill at least once a year, or more frequently if specific
events or circumstances indicate impairment, by testing each CGU (cash-generating unit).
Reference should be made to the 2020 annual report for information on the previous impairment test.

The main economic and financial indicators of the Group for the first quarter of the 2021 financial
year show a positive quarter for the Group with a gross operating profit, net working capital and net
financial position in line with or slightly better than the 2021 budget utilised for the purposes of the
impairment test as at December 31, 2020.

The level of net invested capital at March 31, 2021 is consistent and substantially in line with the most
recent forecasts at that date and therefore there have been no changes in the value of the net invested
capital that could affect the validity of the impairment test carried out with reference to December 31,
2020. With reference to the discount and inflation rate underlying the impairment test carried out with
reference to December 31, 2020, there are no events that have substantially impacted them and, therefore,
they are still applicable and reasonables with the reference date of this Report.

On the basis of this evidence, the Directors have not identified specific events and / or additional
circumstances compared to December 31, 2020 that could lead to believe a reduction in the value of

goodwill and, therefore, the need to update the impairment test carried out for the of the financial
statements at December 31, 2020.

**(24) Current and non-current financial liabilities**

This section provides information on the contractual terms governing the group’s bank overdrafts,
loans and bonds.

Reference should be made to note 30) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for
further information on the group’s exposure to interest and currency risks.

On July 20, 2018, the parent entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (“RCF”) governed by
the laws of England and Wales with UniCredit Bank AG, Milan Branch, as agent, and the lenders (Credit
Suisse International, Banco BPM S.p.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and Unicredit S.p.A.)
for a maximum amount of €80 million at the 3M Euribor/GBP Libor + 2.5% (zero floor). The RCF will
expire on February 28, 2024.

On October 3, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. issued floating rate bonds of €445 million (3M Euribor +
3.5% - zero floor) due in 2024 (the “Bonds”) under an indenture contract governed by the laws of the State
of New York. The contract was signed, inter alia, by Guala Closures S.p.A., as the issuer, The Law
Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c., as the senior secured notes trustee and Bondholders’ representative
pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, Deutsche Bank AG, London branch, as the
paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as the transfer agent and the registrar (the
“Indenture”).

The contract governing the RCF and the Indenture of the Bonds provide for change of control
clauses. Specifically, the threshold that determines a change of control according to the RCF is 35% of
voting rights at Guala Closures shareholders’ meetings, while the same threshold under the Bond
regulation is 50% of voting rights.

Due to the finalization, in March 2021, of the agreements indicated in the press release issued by
Special Packaging Solutions Investments S.à r.l. (“SPSI”) on December 8, 2020 it should be noted that the
condition envisaged by the “change of control” clause relating to the RCF was met and the right to request
for early repayment and extinction of the RCF credit line was exercised by a only bank of the five banks
making up the pool of lending banks. The other four banks issued specific waivers, confirming the credit
lines in place and the amounts used which therefore remained classified as non-current liabilities.

With reference to the portion attributable to the only bank that did not issue waivers (€13 million), it
should be noted that the amount used as of March 31, 2021, equal to €2.7 million, was classified under
current liabilities and in full repayment was made on April 26, 2021.

Therefore, following the implementation of the “change of control” clause envisaged by the RCF, the
available credit line was reduced from €80 million to €67 million.

SPSI published the offering document on May 8, 2021 and it states that the offering period will open
on May 18, 2021 and close on June 7, 2021.

At the date of this Report, the condition provided for by the “change of control” clause with reference
to the Indenture that regulates the Bonds has not been fulfilled.

In consideration of the situation that could arise following the outcome of the mandatory bid on
Guala Closures ordinary shares, the Company is monitoring the evolution of this scenario to take the
appropriate measures where the circumstances provided for by the clauses of “change of control” should
occur.

The Parent Company is monitoring developments with respect to the outcome of the mandatory
public tender offer for its ordinary shares to take the necessary measures should the conditions provided
for in the change of control clause materialise.

The Parent Company has, inter alia, a covenant on the RCF. Failure to comply with it may require the
parent to repay the facility earlier, should the RCF be drawn by more than 40% of its total amount

(€80 million at March 31, 2021). Under this covenant, the ratio of the parent’s indebtedness to
consolidated EBITDA, both calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions of the RCF, shall not
exceed 6.40x.

Under this agreement, the parent’s Treasury department is required to constantly monitor the
covenant and to regularly report to management and the lending bank to ensure compliance. At March 31,
2021, not more than 40% of the facility has been used, which is the trigger for the application of the
covenant. In any case, the covenant is complied with.

Other financial liabilities include the Market Warrants, which have a fair value of €7,745 thousand
and €5,965 thousand at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 respectively. The fair value loss for the
period was recognised as a financial expense in profit or loss (€1,780 thousand). This loss is attributable to
the increase in the market price of the Market Warrants, which went from €0.31 at December 31, 2020 to
€0.40 at March 31, 2021.

On the date of their first trading, the parent recognised 10,000,000 Market Warrants, traded separately
to the shares, for an amount of €6,000,000, by setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount
(described in note 27) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent). Furthermore, on August 6, 2018, the
date the merger became effective, another 9,367,393 Market Warrants were assigned for €9,367,393, setting
up a negative equity reserve of the same amount. The Warrants were assigned free of charge in the ratio of
four Market Warrants to every 10 ordinary shares. They can be exercised against payment as resolved by the
shareholders in their extraordinary meetings of September 26, 2017 and November 16, 2017.

**(24) Current and non-current financial liabilities (Continued)**

Based on the Market Warrant regulation, the Warrant holders may decide to exercise them in whole
or in part at any time and to subscribe the exchange shares at the subscription price, as long as the average
monthly price is higher than the strike price (€10 per share). The subscription price of €0.10 per exchange
share was approved by the shareholders on September 26, 2017 based on the amendments introduced on
October 26, 2017. The parent will publish the acceleration communication should the average monthly
price be the same as or higher than €13 per share.

As a result, the holders of the Market Warrants will be assigned exchange shares based on the
following exchange ratio:

_Average monthly price - Strike price_

_Average monthly price - Subscription price_

Warrants not exercised by the expiry date are taken to have been extinguished and are no longer valid
when by expiry date is meant the first of the following dates: (i) the first trading date after five years from
the relevant transaction’s effective date and (ii) the first trading date after 60 calendar days from the date
of publication of the acceleration communication.

The caption “Non-controlling investors’ put options” it refers to the recognition of the right of some
minorities to exercise a put option upon the occurrence of certain conditions.

This liability was calculated as the discounting of the determined value of the put option at the
estimated time of exercise of the same (refer to the note to the condensed interim consolidated financial
statements no. 30b) for the assumptions underlying the calculation).

This caption has been recognised using the present access method, whereby the financial liability was
recognised as a reduction in equity in the first year. The fluctuation in each year, if any, is recognised under
financial income (expense) in profit or loss and the non-controlling interests continue to be presented
separately as, to all effects, the non-controlling investors have the right to access the profit or loss pertaining
to their investment. Following the Guala Closures–Space4 PPA procedure, the financial liability was adjusted
to reflect the allocation of the resulting gains attributable to non-controlling investors.

Reference should be made to note 30) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for
further details.

As described earlier, the draw-down amount of the Senior Revolving Credit Facility was decreased to
€67 million in April 2021 and the €2.7 million portion was reclassified under current payables at March 31,
2021 following the fulfilment of the condition envisaged by the “change of control” clause of the RCF and
of the right to request early repayment and extinction of the credit line exercised by one of the five banks
making up the pool of lending banks.

The provision for company reorganisations includes:

  - €317 thousand for the downsizing of Guala Closures UK Ltd’s production activities, commenced in
2018, which entails the transfer of plant and machinery from the secondary Broomhill facility to the
main facility in Kirkintilloch. The provision has been calculated considering the cost of terminating
the existing agreements and the benefits due to employees under the related contracts. The
provision is unchanged since the production facility has not yet been definitively discontinued.

  - €311 thousand for the reorganisation of Guala Closures Australia Pty Ltd commenced on
March 29, 2021. This project includes the elimination of some positions as agreed with the trade
unions.

   - €250 thousand for Guala Closures Deutschland and, specifically, the early retirement of
administration staff.

   - €67 thousand for the reorganisation of Guala Closures Turkey and, specifically, the provisional
estimate of liabilities for leasehold improvements and onerous contracts assumed with the
acquisition of the equity investment.

The provision for returns reflects the calculation for customer claims received based on the
negotiations in place at the reporting date.

**(27) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent**

At March 31, 2021, Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares whose ordinary shares and
market warrants have been traded on the Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato Telematico Azioniario)
organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., within the Star Segment, since August 6, 2018.

The paid-up and subscribed share capital of Guala Closures S.p.A. at March 31, 2021 it remained
unchanged compared to December 31, 2020, equal to € 68,907 thousand, divided into 67,184,904 shares, of
which 62,049,966 class A ordinary shares, no. 4,322,438 special class B shares with multiple votes (Class B
special shares entitle the holders to three votes per share and upon any transfer of the Class B special
shares to a third-party, the Class B special shares voting rights will be reduced from three votes per share
to one vote per share) and n. 812,500 Class C Special shares without voting rights but convertible into
ordinary shares with a conversion ratio of 4.5 ordinary shares for each C share (conversion took place in
April 2021).

There are also n. 19,367,393 market warrants, n. 2,500,000 Sponsor Warrants and 1,000,000
Management Warrants

The special shares Class C to which, upon issue, 2,500,000 sponsor warrants have been attached, have
the same rights as the ordinary shares, with the sole exception of the following:

   - they do not have voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings;

   - they do not have the right to dividends approved as ordinary dividends;

   - they cannot be transferred until the last day of the twelfth month after the Relevant Transaction
and, should the Relevant Transaction not take place, for the maximum duration of the company as
established by article 4 of the by-laws except for (i) those transferred to the withdrawing
shareholders of Space Holding after the liquidation procedure as payment in kind for the sale of
their investment; and (ii) those transferred to the beneficiary of a proportionate demerger of Space
Holding S.r.l.;

   - if the Company is dissolved, they give the right to their voters to be paid their stake of liquidation
equity after the ordinary shareholders;

   - they give the right to receive two sponsor warrants for every special share issued;

   - when certain conditions are met, the special shares are automatically converted into ordinary
shares, at the ratio of 4.5 ordinary shares for each special share, without the need for their holders
to express their intention to convert and without any change to be made to the amount of share
capital, provided that the conversion will decrease the implicit carrying amount of ordinary shares.

The sponsor warrants attached to the special shares and assigned free of charge in the ratio of two
warrants for every special share subscribed are not traded on the Italian regulated stock market or abroad.

Each sponsor warrant gives its holder the right to subscribe an exchange share if the share’s official
price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, which is the period
between the first trading date after the Relevant Transaction’s effective date and the tenth anniversary of
this date.

**(27) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent (Continued)**

Furthermore, on 6 August 2018, 1,000,000 Management Warrants were issued. They can be exercised
as of this date and will entitle holders to one Management Warrant share for every exchangeable
management warrant, provided that the post-merger Guala Closures share’s official price is equal to or
higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, and against payment of a subscription price
per share of Euro 13.

Warrants that have not been exercised at the end of this period irrevocably become ineffective and are
taken to have been extinguished as explained in the related regulations to which reference is made.

At March 31, 2021, equity comprises unavailable reserves for market warrants of €19,367 thousand, of
which €6,000 thousand was recognised as a decrease in the share premium reserve following the capital
increase which took place on December 21, 2017 and the concurrent allocation of 10,000 thousand market
warrants, and €9,367 thousand was taken as a reduction of other reserves, following the allocation of the
residual 9,367,393 market warrants upon listing and the concurrent merger on August 6, 2018.

The group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the
group’s future and to support its development.

The group thus seeks to maintain a sufficient level of capitalisation, while giving shareholders
satisfactory returns and ensuring the group has access to external sources of financing at acceptable terms,
including by maintaining an adequate rating.

The group monitors the debt/equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net
indebtedness and cash flows generated by operating activities.

The board of directors carefully monitors the balance between greater returns through the right level
of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position.

To achieve these objectives, the group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable.

The board of directors monitors the return on capital, being total equity, excluding non-controlling
interests, and the amount of dividends to be distributed to holders of ordinary shares.

Based on available information, updated to April 30, 2021, the parent’s main shareholders are as
follows:

   - Investindustrial Advisors Limited, holding 42.573% of the voting rights;

   - GCL Holdings S.à r.l., holding 23.148% of the voting rights;

   - PII G S.à r.l., holding 8.406% of the voting rights

On December 8, 2020, Special Packaging Solutions Investments S.à r.l. (“SPSI”) announced to the
market that it had signed binding agreements for the acquisition of an equity investment in Guala Closures
which, together with the shares that it already held, would constitute an interest of 48.9% of the parent’s
fully diluted[1] share capital. SPSI also announced it had:

   - acquired 16,271,624 ordinary Guala Closures shares, without any attached conditions precedent,
equal to 23.2% of the parent’s fully diluted share capital, giving it 20.7% of the fully diluted voting
rights that can be exercised at shareholders’ meetings;

  - signed co-investment agreements (the “co-investment agreements”) under which it would acquire
another 11,593,237 ordinary Guala Closures shares, representing 16.6% of the parent’s fully diluted
share capital and 14.7% of the fully diluted voting rights, upon the occurrence of certain conditions.
These co-investment agreements also provide that certain of Guala Closures shareholders would
reinvest part or all of the proceeds from the sale of their shares in SPSI; and

1 Based on the information released by SPSI, “fully diluted” refers to the percentage of voting rights and Guala Closures share
capital calculated based on the number and categories of shares that would be issued in the event of the (i) complete conversion
of class C shares into ordinary shares and (ii) non-conversion of class B shares into ordinary shares.

  - signed commitments (the “commitments”) to accept the mandatory public tender offer that SPSI is
required to make as a result of the execution of the co-investment agreements (the effectiveness of
which is linked to the presentation of the bid) for 3,656,250 ordinary Guala Closures shares, equal
to 5.2% of the parent’s fully diluted share capital and 4.6% of the fully diluted voting rights.

On March 25, 2021, SPSI informed the market (as required by article 102.1 of Legislative decree no.
58 of February 24, 1998, the Consolidated finance act) that it had executed the co-investment agreements,
which implies that the conditions for the presentation of the mandatory public tender offer for the parent’s
remaining shares (the “mandatory bid”) had been met. It also noted that it intends to make a voluntary
tender offer for the “Market Warrant Guala Closures S.p.A.” (the “voluntary offer”, together with the
mandatory bid, the “offers”). On the same date, the commitments became effective.

SPSI’s press release of March 25, 2021 stated that, after executing the co-investment agreements, it
held 33,493,940 ordinary shares, equal to 49.9% of the parent’s share capital (at this date) and 44.6% of
the voting rights that can be exercised at the parent’s shareholders’ meetings (again at the date of this press
release).

SPSI also confirmed that it intends to apply for the delisting of Guala Closure’s ordinary shares after
the mandatory public tender offer. Should the outcome of such mandatory public tender offer not make it
possible to delist the shares, SPSI noted in its press release that it reserves the right to request delisting
using other methods, including the merger of Guala Closures into SPSI, an unlisted company, or another
unlisted company controlled by it.

**(30) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

**(b) Measurement of fair values**

**(i) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs**

The market warrants are measured at fair value through profit or loss and classified under other
financial liabilities. Fair value is calculated based on the market price at period end, considering the price
of the STAR segment of the stock exchange, ISIN: IT0005311813.

Therefore, the following changes in fair value could significantly affect the parent’s performance:

– a rise in the market warrants’ fair values could lead to an increase in the parent’s liabilities and
financial expense;

– a reduction in the market warrants’ fair values could lead to a decrease in the parent’s liabilities and
an increase in financial income.

These financial income and expense are accounting changes that do not lead to cash inflows or
outflows.

**(30) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 and Level 3 fair values,
as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.

**Financial instruments measured at fair value**


**Inter-relationship between**
**significant unobservable**
**inputs and fair value**
**measurement**

The estimated fair value
would increase if:

- the gross operating
profit was higher;

- the net financial
position was better;

- the risk-free rate of
the country
decreased;

- the expected dividend
yield decreased;

- the inflation rate
differential between
Ukraine and the USA
increased the
discount rate adjusted
by the group’s credit
risk;

- the expected inflation
rate of the country in
which the subsidiary
is domiciled increased
in the last year of the
plan;

- the expected exercise
date for the put
option was earlier due
to the bringing
forward of the
pensionable or
mortality date and/or
exercise of the change
of control clauses of
Guala Closures
Group and local
administrators.


**Type** **Valuation technique**

Non-controlling investors’ Discounted cash flows:
put options The fair value is
determined considering
the expected payment,
capitalised at the
reporting date, net of the
expected dividend yields,
discounted to present
value using a credit riskadjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is
calculated considering
the fair value of the
subsidiary or its equity
based on the relevant
contractual agreements
with non-controlling
investors.


**Significant unobservable**
**inputs**

- Expected cash flows
in the 2021—2025
plan (€49 million);

- inflation data about
Ukraine, Bulgaria,
Poland and the USA,
used to calculate riskfree rates (1,8%—
5%);

- discount rate specific
to the country in
which the subsidiary
operates, adjusted by
the group’s credit
risk(8%—14%);

- expected date of put
option exercise based
on demographical
assumptions (67—74
age of retire) and any
change of control
clauses.


Forward interest rate

significance/relevance, nature of the counterparties, subject-matter of the transaction, transfer pricing
method and timing of the event (near period end) can give rise to doubts on: correctness/completeness of
information posted, conflicts of interest and the safeguarding of company assets, and of non-controlling
interests.

**(34) Events after the reporting period**

parent filed the related information with the company registrar and Consob as well as making it available
to the market on April 12, 2021.

€68,907 thousand, consisting of 70,028,654 shares, of which 65,706,216 ordinary shares and 4,322,438 class
B multiple-vote shares.

On August 6, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. was merged into Space4 S.p.A..

Following the above transaction, the latter company was renamed Guala Closures S.p.A. and the
group headed by Space4 S.p.A. was renamed Guala Closures Group.

Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares set up under Italian law and registered with the
Alessandria company registrar. Its registered office is in via Rana 12, zona industriale D6, Spinetta
Marengo (Alessandria).

The Guala Closures Group’s main activities involve the design and manufacturing of closures for
spirits, wine and non-alcoholic beverages such as water, olive oil and vinegar to be sold mainly on
international markets.

The group is also active in the production of PET plastic preforms and bottles.

The group’s activities are separated into two divisions:

   - the Closures division, representing the group’s core business, specialised in the production of safety
closures, customised luxury closures, aluminium closures for wine, standard roll-on closures other
sectors;

   - the PET division, which produces PET bottles and miniatures. This division is no longer considered
a core business and, as a result of the reorganisation which entailed the sale of part of the assets and
the transfer of the residual ones from Spain to the United Kingdom in 2019, the division is now
closely connected to the Closures division as its customers and those of the Closure division’s Spirit
sector are the same and because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory market
related to the sale of closures to group customers.

Currently, the group is the European and international leader in the production of safety closures for
spirits bottles, with over 60 years’ experience in the sector.

It is also the leading European producer of aluminium closures for spirits bottles.

**(2) Accounting policies**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU.

They have been prepared in Euros, rounding the amounts to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies
between the consolidated financial statements balances and those in the tables of these notes are due
exclusively to the rounding and do not alter their reliability or substance.

Figures are shown in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise stated.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for
derivatives, market warrants and contingent consideration arising in a business combination (i.e., the put
option on non-controlling interests) which are measured at fair value, and on a going concern basis. There
are no business risks and/or any identified uncertainties which may cast doubts on the group’s ability to
continue as a going concern.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the following formats:

   - statement of financial position captions are classified by current and non-current assets and
liabilities;

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

   - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) captions are classified by
nature;

   - the statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method;

   - the statement of changes in equity has been prepared in accordance with the structure of changes in
equity.

Starting from the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020, the Group has changed
the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income which has been divided into two statements:
the statement of profit or loss and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The
comparative data relating to the same period of the previous year have been reclassified accordingly.

For each asset and liability caption including amounts due within and after one year, the amount
which is expected to be received or paid after one year is shown.

Pursuant to Consob resolution no. 15519 of July 27, 2006 on financial statements, significant related
party transactions and non-recurring items have been indicated separately in the consolidated financial
statements.

**a)** **Accounting for business combinations**

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of
activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In
determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the
set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether
the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.

The Group has an option to apply a ‘concentration test’ that permits a simplified assessment of
whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or
group of similar identifiable assets.

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the
identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a
bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred,
except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to
pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then
it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent
consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of
the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by
the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards), then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s
replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement awards compared with the
market-based measure of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to
pre-combination service.

**Investments in non-controlling interests (“NCI”)**

NCI are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the
date of acquisition.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group ‘controls’ an entity when it is exposed to,
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which
control ceases.

**Loss of control**

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in
profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

**Interests in equity-accounted investees**

The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates and a joint
venture.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint
control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group
has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to
its assets and obligations for its liabilities.

Interests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are
initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and OCI of equityaccounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign
currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised
gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to
the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**(b) Use of estimates and judgements**

Management has to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
accounting policies and the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and revenue. Estimates and the
related assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered to be reasonable in the
circumstances. They are adopted to estimate the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot
readily be assumed from other sources. However, as they are estimates, the actual figure may not match
the result of the estimate. Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a
significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in the next financial year is included in the following
notes: loss allowance (note (p) estimated expected credit losses) and allowance for inventory write-down
(note 24 inventory estimated recoverability), amortisation/depreciation and impairment of non-current
assets (notes (i) (k) estimated useful life), employee benefits (note 34 estimated actuarial assumptions),
taxes (note 29 estimated future taxable income), provisions (note 32), measurement of financial derivatives
and measurement of business combinations (note 7 estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities),
market warrants (note 30 estimated fair value of market warrants), financial liabilities to non-controlling
investors (note 30 fair value put option).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Such estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Any changes arising therefrom are recognised
in the year in which the review takes place if this only affects that year. If the review relates to both current
and future years, the change is recognised in the year in which the review takes place.

**(c) Changes in accounting standards**

New applicable standards

The new standards and/or amendments thereto applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on
or after January 1, 2020 are set out below:

  - Definition of Material—amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8

  - Definition of a Business—amendments to IFRS 3

  - Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

  - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7

  - Rent concessions related to Covid-19 (amendment to IFRS 16 Leases)

The same accounting policies as those used for the consolidated financial statements at December 31,
2019 are applied to these. Furthermore, no retrospective adjustments were made.

**(d) Foreign currency**

**Functional currency and presentation currency**

The figures stated in the financial statements of each group company are measured using their
functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company
operates. The consolidated financial statements are drawn up in Euros, the parent’s functional and
presentation currency.

**Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of group
companies at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction date.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency at the exchange rate at the same date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Exchange differences are generally
recognised in profit or loss and presented within financial expense.

However, exchange differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in
other comprehensive income:

   - an investment in equity securities designated as at FVOCI;

   - a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent
that the hedge is effective; and

   - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.

**Foreign operations**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising
on acquisition, are translated into euro at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and
expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated
into euro at the exchange rates at the transaction date.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Hyperinflationary economy: since 2018 Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy
as defined by IFRS, specifically IAS 29. Consequently, following Argentina’s inclusion in the list of
hyperinflationary economies, as of July 1, 2018 and effective from January 1, 2018, Guala Closures Group
has applied IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.

At December 31, 2020, the group’s operations in Argentina represented approximately 2% of its
revenue, (0.6)% of its operating performance and 0.3% of its net assets.

Exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation
reserve in equity. However, if the operation is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant
proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a
foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the
cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or
loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reallocated to non-controlling interests. When the group disposes of only part of its
investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant
influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.

The following exchange rates are applied to translate those financial statements presented in
currencies that are not legal tender in Italy:

**(e) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and on-demand deposits as well as all highly-liquid
investments with an original expiry date equal to or of less than three months.

Cash and cash equivalents are calculated in the same way for both the statement of financial position
and statement of cash flows.

**(f)** **Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost and net realisable value. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of
completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

F-59


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

The production cost of finished goods includes the portions of the costs of raw materials and external
materials and processing, as well as all other direct and indirect production costs reasonably attributable to
the products, excluding financial expense.

Purchase or production cost is calculated on a weighted average cost basis.

Obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories are written down on the basis of their estimated possibility
of use or future realisable value, through an accrual to the specific allowance adjusting the value of
inventories. The amount is reinstated if, in subsequent years, the reasons for the write-down no longer
exist.

**(g) Assets held for sale and disposal groups**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for sale if
it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to
the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories,
financial assets, deferred tax assets or employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in
accordance with the group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as
held-for-sale or held-for-distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in
profit or loss.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer
amortised or depreciated.

**(h) Discontinued operation**

A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s business, the operations and cash flows of
which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the group and which:

   - represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;

   - is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations; or

   - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.

Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation
meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.

When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start
of the comparative year.

**(i)** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognised at historical cost, including directly related ancillary
costs necessary for the use of the asset. Borrowing costs related to loans taken out specifically for
investments in property, plant and equipment are considered part of the carrying amount of the related
assets and, as such, capitalised.

Subsequent expenditure is included in an asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that the future
economic benefits exceeding those determined originally will flow to the group. This expenditure is
depreciated over the related asset’s residual useful life. All other expenditure is expensed in the year in
which it is incurred.

Property, plant and equipment are shown net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses
determined as set out later on.

F-60

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their
estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally
recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their
useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.

Land is not depreciated.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted if appropriate. The depreciation periods are as follows:

**Depreciation period**
**(years)**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 – 35

Internal means of transport, electronic equipment and mobile phones . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 – 8

Subsequent expenditure is included in an asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that the future
economic benefits exceeding those determined originally will flow to the group. This expenditure is
depreciated over the related asset’s residual useful life. All other expenditure is expensed in the year in
which it is incurred.

At the time of disposal or when there are no expected future economic benefits from an asset’s use,
the caption is derecognised. Any gain or loss (calculated as the difference between the sales amount and
carrying amount) is taken to profit or loss in the year of derecognition.

**(k) Intangible assets**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognised at cost. After initial
recognition, goodwill is adjusted for any accumulated impairment losses, determined using the criteria
described in paragraph (p) impairment losses.

_Research expenditure_

Expenditure on research undertaken to gain scientific and technical knowledge and information is
recognised as an expense when incurred.

_Development expenditure_

Development expenditure, which also relates to the application of research findings to a plan or
design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is capitalised when the
product or process is feasible in technical and commercial terms and the group has adequate resources to
complete the development stage and the group has concluded that it will have the ability to use it.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost, net of accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses.

_Other intangible assets_

These assets are measured at cost, determined in the same way as described for property, plant and
equipment.

Other intangible assets, which all have a finite useful life, are subsequently shown net of accumulated

equipment.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Useful life is checked annually and, where necessary, any changes are reflected on a prospective basis.

The amortisation periods for intangible assets are as follows:

**Amortisation period**
**(years)**

Development expenditure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5
Patents and trademarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 – 10
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5
Licences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5

Other capitalised expenditure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 or in line with the contract term

Subsequent expenditure is included in an asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that the future
economic benefits exceeding those determined originally will flow to the group. This expenditure is
amortised over the related asset’s residual useful life. All other expenditure is expensed in the year in
which it is incurred.

The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an intangible asset is determined as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and carrying amount. It is recognised in profit or loss at the time of
disposal.

**(I)** **Income taxes**

Income taxes comprise current and deferred tax. They are recognised in profit or loss except to the
extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other
comprehensive income (OCI).

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year
and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates
enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from
dividends.

Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends and any interest and penalties imposed by the
tax authorities following their review of the tax position of previous years which found a difference in tax
due.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is
not recognised for:

   - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to
the extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

   - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related
tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. The measurement
of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group
expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

The income tax consequences of dividends are recognised when the dividend is approved.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the group takes into account the impact of
uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The group believes that its
accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors,
including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and
assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become
available that causes the group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities;
such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the year that such a determination is made.

**(m) Financial instruments**

_Recognition and measurement_

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All
other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial
liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly
attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is
initially measured at the transaction price.

_Classification and subsequent measurement_

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI—debt
investment; FVOCI—equity investment; or FVTPL.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its
business model for managing financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on
the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated as at FVTPL:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;
and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated as at FVTPL:

   - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual
cash flows and selling financial assets; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the group may irrevocably
elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an
investment-by-investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are
measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets (see paragraph (n)). On initial
recognition, the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to
be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly
reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Financial assets: business model assessment

The group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is
held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is
provided to management. The information considered includes:

   - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.
These include whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income,
maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the
duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale
of the assets;

   - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group’s key managers;

   - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that
business model) and how those risks are managed;

  - how managers of the business are compensated—e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair
value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and

   - the frequency, value and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such
sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are
not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the group’s continuing recognition of the assets.

Financial assets that are held for trading or whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are
measured at FVTPL.

Financial assets: assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk
associated with the principal amount outstanding in a given period and for other basic lending risks and
costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as for the profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the
group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset
contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it
would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the group considers:

   - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;

   - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;

  - prepayment and extension features; and

   - terms that limit the group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the
contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium on its contractual
par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the
contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable
additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of
the prepayment feature is immaterial at initial recognition.

Financial assets: subsequent measurement and gains and losses

##### Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and
losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in
profit or loss. See note (n) for derivatives designated as hedging
instruments.
##### Financial assets measured at These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the amortised cost effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by
impairment losses. Interest income, exchange gains and losses and
impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on
derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
##### Debt investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest
income calculated using the effective interest method, exchange
gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On
derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified
to profit or loss.
##### Equity investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends
are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend
clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never
reclassified to profit or loss.

Financial liabilities: classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is
classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on
initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses,
including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and exchange gains and
losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

See note (n) for financial liabilities designated as hedging instruments.

_Derecognition_

Financial assets

The group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in
which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it
does not retain control of the financial asset.

The group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial
position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these
cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

Financial liabilities

The group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or
cancelled, or expire. The group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the
cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based
on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and
the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in
profit or loss.

_Offsetting_

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

**(n) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk
exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the
host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are
measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.

The group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows
associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in exchange rates and interest
rates and certain derivatives and non-derivative financial liabilities as hedges of currency risk on a net
investment in a foreign operation.

At the inception of designated hedging relationships, the group documents the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The group also documents the economic relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.

Cash flow hedges

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in
the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative
change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or
loss.

The group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts
as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships. The change in fair value of the forward
element of forward exchange contracts (‘forward points’) is separately accounted for as a cost of hedging
and recognised in a hedging reserve within equity.

When the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item
such as inventories, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve is
included directly in the initial cost of the non-financial item when it is recognised.

For all other hedged forecast transactions, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the
cost of hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same year or years during which the hedged
expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold,
expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge
accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging
reserve remains in equity until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in the recognition of a non-financial
item, it is included in the non-financial item’s cost on its initial recognition or, for other cash flow hedges, it
is reclassified to profit or loss in the same year or years as the hedged expected future cash flows affect
profit or loss.

F-66


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been
accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit
or loss.

**(o) Share capital and equity**

_Ordinary shares_

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary
shares are recognised as a decrease in equity, net of any tax effects.

_Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)_

When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which
includes directly attributable costs is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are
classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold
or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting
surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.

_Business combinations_

When as a result of a takeover/acquisition of control not involving the entire stake in the acquiree, the
group has the potential obligation to acquire the residual investment in the acquiree should the
non-controlling investors exercise a put option and the non-controlling investor still has present access to
the economic benefit associated with the underlying ownership interests, it recognises a liability calculated
by discounting the estimated value at the exercise date using the present access method whereby a liability
is recognised decreasing the equity caption “Retained earnings (losses carried forward)” in the first year,
with subsequent remeasurement recognised in profit or loss as financial expense.

_Warrants_

Warrants are recognised in accordance with the conditions set out in the relevant regulations
governing their operation.

_Warrants with fixed conversion parameter_

Some warrants (sponsor warrants and management warrants) have fixed and predetermined
subscription prices and exercise ratios at the date of issue within predefined time windows. In these cases,
the warrant regulation provides for the number of shares that will be issued and the price (if any) that the
holder must pay to the company on the date of exercise of the warrants. These instruments are accounted
for by the group as equity instruments.

_Warrants with variable conversion parameter_

Some warrants (market warrants) have a conversion ratio that varies over time and according to the
variability of the market price of the underlying share and other parameters provided for in the relevant
regulation. Despite the variability of the conversion ratio, the expiry date of the warrant is brought forward
when certain thresholds of the price of the underlying share are achieved (thus representing a cap on its
appreciation) with the right to settle the instrument through the delivery of shares or cash to the bearer of
the rights or to the issuer. The group recognises these instruments as derivative financial liabilities. Given
their characteristics, these instruments are qualified and classified as derivatives in accordance with IFRS
9, and the related fair value gains and losses are taken to profit or loss.

**(p) Impairment**

_Non-derivative financial instruments_

Financial instruments and contract assets

The group recognises loss allowances for ECLs on:

   - financial assets measured at amortised cost;

   - contract assets.

The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following,
which are measured as 12-month ECLs:

   - debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and

   - other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over
the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating ECLs, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that
is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative
information and analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and
including forward-looking information.

The group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than
90 days past due.

The group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit
obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as enforcing a security (if any
are held).

Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a
financial instrument.

12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12
months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12
months).

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over
which the group is exposed to credit risk.

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present
value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with
the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive).

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt
securities at FVOCI are credit impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when one or more events
that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying
amount of the assets.

For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is partially or fully impaired to the extent the group has
no reasonable expectations of its recovery. For customers, the group individually makes an assessment of
the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The

F-68


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures
for recovery of amounts due.

_Non-financial assets_

At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets, except for
inventories and deferred tax assets, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected
to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets
in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**(q) Employee benefits**

The group’s net obligation in respect of defined contribution plans relates to the post-employment
benefit plans whereby the group companies pay fixed contributions to an entity that is legally separated on
a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis without there being any actual or constructive obligation to
make additional payments if the entity does not hold sufficient assets to pay all accrued pension benefits
relating to current or past services. Contributions payable are recognised in profit or loss on an accruals
basis and classified as personnel expense.

The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the group, the
recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of
economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses, the
return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are
recognised immediately in OCI. The group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net
defined benefit liability (asset) for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined
benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset),
taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the year as a result of
contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit
plans are recognised in profit or loss.

F-69


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefits
that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement
occurs.

IFRIC 14 clarifies the provisions of IAS 19 “Employee benefits” with respect to the measurement of
defined benefit plan assets when there is a minimum funding requirement. A defined benefit plan is in
surplus when the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
IFRIC 14/IAS 19 only permit the recognition of this surplus at the present value of the financial benefits
available through refunds or reductions in future contributions. Moreover, disclosure is required when the
plan requires a minimum contribution that could give rise to a liability.

For the Italian companies, starting from January 1, 2007, the Finance Act (Law no. 296 of
December 27, 2006, the “2006 Finance Act”) and the relevant implementation decrees introduced
important changes in the rules governing post-employment benefits (“TFR”), including the need for
employees to decide on the allocation of their future benefits. In particular, this reform established that
employees had to transfer the new amounts of their benefits to established pension funds after January 1,
2007 or leave them with the company; in the latter case, the company would pay these amounts to a
specific INPS (Italian social security institution) treasury account. Therefore, the post-employment
benefits stated in the consolidated financial statements refer to the amount due to employees, not yet paid
but vested up to December 31, 2006.

**(r)** **Provisions**

Provisions include certain or probable costs and charges, the amount or due date of which is unknown
at year end. A provision is recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow from the group of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The
provisions are stated as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the
reporting date or to transfer it to a third party at that date. If the impact of discounting the time value of
money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. Where discounting is
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as financial expense.

**(s)** **Revenue**

The group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers since January 1, 2018.
Specifically, IFRS 15 introduced a new model for revenue recognition based on the following five steps:

   - identify the contract(s) with a customer

   - identify the performance obligations in the contract;

   - determine the transaction price;

   - allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

   - recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

Revenue is recognised, net of returns, discounts, rebates and bonuses, as well as taxes directly related
to the sale of products and the provision of services. They are measured taking into account the
consideration specified in the contract with the customer. The group, which generally operates as principal,
recognises revenue when it transfers control of the goods or services (point in time). Control of the safety
and standard closures is transferred to the customers when the goods are delivered to their premises, i.e.,
when the goods are taken over by the carrier selected by the customer if earlier and, accordingly, the group
recognises the related revenue at such times. There are generally no further contractual obligations for the
group.

There are no significant discounts for final customers and there are no contracts which enable
customers to return products (with the exception of faulty goods or replacements of damage goods that are
accounting for in the Provision for returns) in exchange for new ones or cash reimbursements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Usually, no costs are incurred to obtain or perform contracts with customers.

**(t)** **Government grants**

Grants relating to assets and income are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the group
will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received. Grants related to
assets are recognised as deferred revenue under Other liabilities in the statement of financial position and
are taken to profit or loss on a systematic basis to offset them against the depreciation of the relevant
assets. Grants relating to income are recognised under Other operating income.

**(u) Financial income and expense**

The group’s financial income and finance expense include:

   - interest income;

   - interest expense;

  - dividend income;

   - dividends on preference shares classified as financial liabilities;

   - the net gain or loss on the disposal of investments in debt securities measured at FVOCI;

   - the net gain or loss on financial assets at FVTPL;

   - the exchange gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities;

   - impairment losses (and reversals) on investments in debt securities carried at amortised cost
or FVOCI;

   - the gain on the remeasurement to fair value of any pre-existing interest in an acquiree in a business
combination;

   - the fair value loss on contingent consideration classified as a financial liability;

   - hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss; and

   - the reclassification of net gains and losses previously recognised in OCI on cash flow hedges of
interest rate risk and foreign currency risk for borrowings.

Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is
recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the group’s right to receive payment is established.

The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

   - the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or

   - the amortised cost of the financial liability.

In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying
amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.
However, for financial assets that have become credit impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If
the asset is no longer credit impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

**(v) Determination of fair value**

‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or the most
advantageous market to which the group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its
non-performance risk.

Several standards and disclosure requirements require the determination of fair value of financial and
non-financial assets and liabilities.

When one is available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an
active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability
take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the group uses valuation techniques that
maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen
valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in
pricing a transaction.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the group
measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the
transaction price—i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the group determines that
the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced
neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation
technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement,
then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between
the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in
profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is
wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in
the valuation techniques as follows:

   - Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

   - Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices);

   - Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are categorised into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the level
of the lowest level input that is significant to measurement.

The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.

**(w) Leases**

At inception of a contract, the group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration.

**A. Leases in which the group is a lessee**

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the group
allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone
prices. However, for the leases of property, the group has elected not to separate non-lease components
and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

The group recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. The
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs
incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of
the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as that of property and equipment. In addition,
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be
readily determined, the group’s incremental borrowing rate (i.e., the incremental borrowing rate of each
Guala Closures Group company) or the Guala Closures Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

   - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

   - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate
as at the commencement date;

   - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

   - the exercise price under a purchase option that the group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease
payments in an optional renewal period if the group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension
option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group is reasonably certain not to
terminate early.

The group considered the renewal options when determining the lease term and, specifically,
considered as reasonably certain the exercise of the first renewal option which may be included in the
lease. With respect to leases that do not contain annual automatic renewal options, the group considered
the lease term based on the time horizon of the business plan prepared by group management (five years),
assuming that this time horizon properly reflects a period of time adequate to assess the lease term with a
reasonable certainty. Assessment of the reasonable certainty of exercising the renewal option affects the
lease term which, in turn, significantly affects the lease liability and the right-of-use asset.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is
remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if
there is a change in the group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value
guarantee, if the group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or
termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use
asset has been reduced to zero.

The group presents right-of-use assets separately from property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets and it recognises lease liabilities under ‘financial liabilities’.

**B. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets**

The group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value
assets and short-term leases. The group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**_C. Leases in which the group is a lessor_**

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the group allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone prices.

When the group acts as lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or
an operating lease.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

To classify each lease, the group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case,
then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the group
considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

The group recognises ease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis
over the least term as part of ‘other revenue’.

**(y) Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable**

The following are the new accounting standards and / or their amendments applicable to the annual
financial statements subsequent to December 31, 2020.

A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020 and
earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards
in preparing these consolidated financial statements, given the expectation that they will not have a
significant impact on the annual financial statements:

   - extension of the temporary extension of the application of IFRS 9 (amendments to IFRS 4);

  - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and
IFRS 16). The amendments address issues that might affect financial reporting as a result of the
reform of an interest rate benchmark, including the effects of changes to contractual cash flows or
hedging relationships arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an
alternative benchmark rate. The amendments provide practical relief from certain requirements in
IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to: changes in the basis for determining
contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities; and hedge
accounting. The amendments will require an entity to account for a change in the basis for
determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that is required by
interest rate benchmark reform by updating the effective interest rate of the financial asset or
financial liability.

At December 31, 2020, the Group has a credit line Senior Revolving Credit Facility partially used for
£11 million at LIBOR interest rate that will be subject to IBOR reform. The Group expects that no
significant modification gain or loss will arise as a result of applying the amendments to these changes.

The effects deriving from future applications of the aforementioned accounting standards or
amendments are currently being evaluated but should not have significant impacts in the future.

At the reference date of these consolidated financial statements, the competent bodies of the
European Union had not yet completed the approval process necessary for the application of the new
standards and amendments:

  - IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts

  - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including subsequent amendments issued in June 2020

  - Amendments

   - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
(Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)

  - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3)

  - Property, plant and equipment: proceeds before intended use (Amendments to IAS 16)

  - Onerous contracts—Cost of fulfilling a contract (Amendments to IAS 37)

  - Annual improvements to IFRS Standards (Cycle 2018–2020)

   - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1), including
subsequent amendment issued in July 2020.

**(4) Covid-19**

The worldwide outbreak of Covid-19 and the consequent restrictive measures implemented by the
public authorities of the affected countries to contain it characterised the 2020 international scenario. In
addition to its enormous social impact, this ongoing public health emergency is also having direct and
indirect effects on general economic performance and on consumption and investments, leading to general
uncertainty.

The Guala Closures Group acted immediately to implement all actions necessary to minimise the
social and occupational health and safety and financial impacts by defining and implementing flexible and
timely action plans.

From the outset, the Guala Closures Group has worked tirelessly to ensure the utmost health and
safety for its employees, customers and suppliers. The group immediately implemented a series of
protective measures for its personnel, investing in personal protective equipment to ensure that activities
are carried out in accordance with best practices in terms of occupational safety.

China was the first to sound the alarm at the beginning of the year, and the virus is now present
worldwide at differing levels of intensities in the various countries. The World Health Organisation
(WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 after a steadily growing number of countries
reported cases. To contain the spread, the governments of the various countries introduced increasingly
restrictive measures aimed at limiting movement and contact between people, as well as shutting down—
sometimes entirely—production activities in sectors classed as non-essential, allowing only essential
activities and production to continue, including those of the food, drinks and pharmaceuticals sector in
which the group operates, along with logistics services and transport.

The Guala Closures Group’s priority is and will remain ensuring the safety of its employees and
business continuity. The group quickly and responsibly took all steps and safety measures identified by the
authorities in the various markets, introducing new protocols, work practices and safety precautions.

To this end, the safety and prevention measures introduced at the onset of the emergency are still in
place and are continuously updated to comply with the new directives issued by the competent authorities.
Constant liaising with key business partners such as suppliers and customers has been further ramped up
with the aim of ensuring business continuity. Specific business continuity plans have been prepared with
the group’s key customers.

In addition to the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as the distribution of
disposable masks and gloves, social distancing between workers, measuring body temperature when
entering the workplace and the sanitisation of all premises every two weeks, the group entered into a
Covid-19 insurance policy with AON, a leading insurance company, covering all its workers worldwide.

Furthermore, the group’s focus on the communities in which it operates has seen it begin production
of polycarbonate face shields in Luxembourg which are sold to businesses in order to finance the free
supply of such face shields to healthcare structures in Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg.

All 30 group production facilities are operational at the date of this document.

Most of them continued to operate during the entire lockdown—where imposed—in compliance with
the regulations for each country, as the type of activity carried out was classified among those that, except
for temporary bans imposed by local governments, could continue despite the restrictions.

In particular, all the group’s European facilities are and have always been operational. In detail, the
Italian facilities were operational throughout the lockdown as their business was part of the essential
supply chain, as were the facilities in Spain and France. Those in the UK and the newly acquired facility in
Germany also continued to operate throughout the lockdown, albeit at slower rates than expected due to
Covid-19. The facilities in Eastern Europe, (Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Belarus) continued to operate
at full capacity.

The group’s Asian facilities are among those that were most affected by the policies implemented by
their respective governments to contain the spread of the virus. Indeed, the Indian facilities stopped
operations on March 22 because of the country’s total lockdown imposed by the local government and

**(4) Covid-19 (Continued)**

resumed operations on April 27 at reduced capacity because of the national ban on the sale of alcohol until
early May and the shuttering of bars and restaurants until September, while the Chinese facility stopped
during the period between January 24 and February 14.

The health emergency did not stop operations at the group’s American facilities, with the exception of
Argentina where production was suspended for a limited period of time (March 20 to April 1), pending
authorisation to continue activities necessary for the essential supply chain. The Californian (USA) and
the Mexican facilities continued to operate as they are essential to the supply chain, and at sustained rates
due to the growth in volumes for brands focused on off-premises and e-commerce sales, which spiked with
Covid-19. The Chilean facility continued to operate at full capacity and, in Brazil, operations never
stopped since the government authorities have not implemented any lockdown measures. In Colombia,
during the lockdown period from March 20 to May 11, production was converted to produce closures for
disinfectants. The production of closures for spirits subsequently resumed, although sales volumes were
depressed by the closure of public places of business by local government order until September.

In Oceania, the group’s facilities in Australia and New Zealand continued to operate as they are
considered part of essential supply chains.

The group’s African facilities recorded different trends. The facility in Kenya continued to operate
and, locally, no lockdowns were imposed on manufacturing activities, while the facility in South Africa was
partially operational and, during the lockdown period from March 26 to April 30, only produced for the
Water & Beverage and Pharma markets, which the South African government had classified as part of the
essential supply chain. Conversely, production was suspended for the spirits market during that period.

The group’s business was only marginally impacted by Covid-19 starting in the first quarter of 2020,
when the impact was limited to operations in India, China, Argentina and South Africa, where operations
were ordered to temporarily shut down, as described above. In the second quarter of 2020, the impact of
Covid-19 was significant, with a loss of sale volumes mainly in the group’s operations in: India, where the
government imposed a full lockdown of the country between March 22 and April 27 and banned the sale of
alcohol from the end of March to the start of May with the shuttering of bars and restaurants until
September; the United Kingdom, where operations are mainly geared more towards global brands and the
duty free market; South Africa, where the partial closure of the facilities between March 26 and April 30
meant that it was only possible to produce limited quantities for small niches of the mineral water and
beverage markets and the pharmaceutical sector and the sale of alcohol was banned from March 27 to
June 1 and from July 12 to August 17; Colombia, where production was converted during the March 20 to
May 11 lockdown to produce closures for disinfectants and public places of business remained shuttered
until September; Spain and Italy, which were the European countries hit the hardest by Covid-19. In the
second half of 2020, Covid-19 continued to impact the group’s business, although with less force than in
the second quarter and the effects remained mostly concentrated in India, Spain, Italy and Colombia.

The impact of Covid-19 was felt most heavily in the spirits market, being the sector with the greatest
exposure to consumption in the distribution channel represented by bars and restaurants, which generally
led to the formation of groups of people, given their function as public places for socialising (revenue of
€402.3 million in 2019, down by €31.5 million, or 7.8%, to €370.7 million in 2020 at constant exchange
rates). The severe restrictions aimed at containing and slowing the spread of the virus by limiting social
contact and social gatherings resulted in the almost complete closure of the on-premises channel in the
second quarter of 2020 and, in certain countries, in the third quarter as well. The strict limits to travel also
adversely affected sales through the duty free (“Global Travel Retail”) channel.

As regards the business trend for this year, the restrictive measures were eased towards the end of the
second quarter of 2020, with local governments gradually lifting shuttering orders on the HORECA sector
in the third quarter of 2020, albeit with different dynamics and, in certain cases, with the reintroduction of
restrictions in specific areas. Near the end of the year, the curve of infections rose again in Europe and
local authorities ordered new containment measures, which included another round of restrictions on the
HORECA sector and travel.

**(4) Covid-19 (Continued)**

In 2020, the Guala Closures Group has felt the consequences of Covid-19 both in terms of decreased
sales volumes and in terms of additional costs to ensure the safety of facilities and employees and lower
production efficiency as a result of ensuring compliance with safety and social distancing requirements.
These were partly offset by measures to contain personnel expense, lower travel expenses and government
assistance.

The costs directly attributable to Covid-19 mainly relate to personal protective equipment (PPE) for
employees, sanitisation and the adaptation of work areas to comply with social distancing requirements.

In response to the decrease in sales volumes, the group began introducing measures to contain
personnel expense in the second quarter of 2020 in order to limit the effect on the profit margin.

This resulted in a decrease in personnel expense, mainly in those European countries hit the hardest
by the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the United Kingdom, where the social shock absorbers introduced
by the UK government (furlough) meant production could be reduced commensurate with the lower sales
volumes using this income support measure, and in Spain and in Italy, where production was optimised by
scheduling holiday leave for employees, concentrating production on the weekdays, avoiding production
during the weekend and curtailing bonuses.

In India and South Africa, where the extremely severe April lockdowns imposed by the respective
governments resulted in a shutdown of around one month, personnel expense did not decrease in
proportion to the drop in volumes as the group also bore the personnel expense during the shutdown
period, pursuant to local regulations. There were, however, some savings on personnel expense in these
countries, mainly linked to the lower use of temporary workers in India and to the smaller number of
overtime hours worked, the greater use of holiday leave and the decrease in employee numbers in South
Africa.

In China, where the group suspended production between January 24 and February 14, personnel
expense fell as a result of the government’s reduction in social security contributions and the smaller
workforce as seven employees left.

Colombia was the country where group operations were impacted the most in the South American
region, producing only disinfectant closures between March 20 and May 11. Personnel expense savings
were achieved thanks to the use of holiday leave and the relief granted by the Colombian government
which suspended social security contributions for two months. In the rest of South America, where the
negative impact of Covid-19 was less extreme than in the areas of Europe and Asia where the group
operates, personnel expense was substantially stable in all countries.

The group received assistance to decrease personnel expense in the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and
Argentina, reductions in social security contributions in China and liquidity support measures, particularly
the postponement of the deadline for payment of indirect taxes such as VAT in the United Kingdom and
the reduction of the VAT rate from 19% to 16% in Germany from July to December 2020.

In financial terms, the group’s liquidity, both current and prospective, is monitored constantly. At the
preparation date of this document, there were no significant impacts on collection or payment activities
directly or indirectly related to the Covid-19 health emergency. The available liquidity is adequate to cover
current and prospective operating needs with ample headroom available in the event of exceptional and
unforeseeable circumstances.

**(5) Brexit**

The United Kingdom officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020, following the
referendum of June 23, 2016 which endorsed the exit process.

Consequently, 2020 was a transition period in which the UK and the EU negotiated the terms of their
future relationship. For the entirety of the transition period, EU law continued to apply to the UK and
part of the customs union and single EU market rules remained in place, meaning there were no
repercussions for the Guala Closures Group, which performs a significant share of its operations in the
UK.

F-77

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(5) Brexit (Continued)**

As of January 1, 2021, the UK is no longer a member of the single market and customs union and is
no longer a party to the EU’s international agreements, and the agreements signed on December 24, 2020
establish the terms of the relationship between the parties.

Such agreements between the parties include, notably, the “Free Trade Agreement”, which provides
for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, and therefore
the group’s products. With respect to transport, the same agreement provides for continued and
sustainable air, road, rail and maritime connectivity. Indeed, with the exception of a few customs delays in
January due to the increased administrative burdens, which have now been resolved, the group has not
seen a material impact on its operations.

Furthermore, the UK has rolled out a simplified process for value-added tax on imports, and this has
not created any changes to the group’s cash flows and administrative streams post-Brexit.

However, Brexit has clearly complicated the administrative process for imports and exports from and
to the EU, but the financial impact of these additional burdens is immaterial for the group.

In light of the above, as was foreseen, Brexit had no material impact on the group’s results of
operations in the UK.

**(6) Operating segments**

Reportable segments are the group’s strategic divisions as determined in accordance with the
quantitative and qualitative requirements of IFRS 8.

The group has only one reportable segment, the Closures division. The group’s key management
(CODM, who are accountable for operating decisions) reviews internal management reports on a monthly
basis. The following summary describes the operations in this reportable segment.

The Closures division is the group’s core business. Other operations consist of the PET division which
did not meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments under IFRS 8 at the
reporting date.

During the second quarter of 2019, the Guala Closures Group launched the reorganisation of the
PET division, which consisted solely of Guala Closures Iberica, up until the acquisition of the British UCP
on December 12, 2018. After acquiring UCP, the group decided to reorganise the division by transferring
part of the assets and concentrating the remaining assets with Guala Closures UCP.

Information regarding the results of the group’s reportable segment is included below. Performance is
measured based on segment revenue, Profit (loss) before taxation, amortisation and depreciation, trade
receivables, inventories, trade payables, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and capital
expenditure as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the CEO and by the
board of directors.

Management considers the above information as the most suitable to evaluate the results of the
segment compared to other entities that operate in these industries.

Other asset and liability figures cannot be reported by segment as management believes that the
availability of such information by segment is not material.

The group is not exposed to significant geographical risks other than normal business risks.

**Information about key customers**

In the Closures segment, there are two customers in 2020 that generate over 10% of revenue each: the
turnover of the first customer amounts to around €68 million for 2020 (roughly 12% of net revenue), while
that of the second customer is approximately €58 million for the same year (roughly 10% of net revenue).

**(7) Acquisitions of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests**

In 2020, the group closed on the following non-recurring transactions:

   - Acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH’s assets;

   - Subscription of a non-controlling interest in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd;

  - Sale of 100% of GCL Pharma S.r.l.;

   - Acquisition of a non-controlling interest in Guala Closures France S.a.s. via capital increase;

   - Acquisition of 100% of Closurelogic Ambalaj Ve kapak Sistemleri San. Ve Tic. Ltd. Sti, a Turkish
company.

**(7.1) Acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH’s assets**

**(7.1.1) Introduction**

On February 3, 2020, through Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH, the German subsidiary established
in December 2019 specifically for this purpose, the group acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German
manufacturer specialising in aluminium closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral
water sector, following insolvency proceedings.

The transaction entailed the acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH’s property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets, including the building in Worms, worth €7.2 million, inventories of approximately
€5.0 million, in addition to advances to suppliers of roughly €0.3 million, i.e., all owned assets and
personnel, except for the shares of the Turkish subsidiary, which was acquired in September 2020,
following the completion of the step plan identified in the due diligence.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(7) Acquisitions of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests (Continued)**

Thanks to this acquisition, the Guala Closures Group now has a significant presence on the German
market where, until now, it had had a marginal presence in the mineral water sector. Following this
acquisition, the group is also a major player in the world market of glass-bottle beverages and mineral
water, opening up new horizons for growth in this sector.

During the eleven month period ended on 31 December 2020, the subsidiary generated net revenue of
Euro 30.9 million and a loss of Euro 2.4 million. According to management, had the acquisition taken
place on January 1, 2020, consolidated revenue and the consolidated loss for the period would have
amounted to approximately €576.4 million and about €6.0 million, respectively. In calculating the above
amounts, management assumed that the provisionally-determined fair value adjustments at the acquisition
date would have been the same even if the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2020.

**(7.1.2) Consideration transferred**

The consideration transferred at the acquisition date amounts to €12,187 thousand. No cash and cash
equivalents were acquired.

**(7.1.3) Transaction costs**

The group incurred transaction costs of approximately €0.3 million related to legal and notary fees
and due diligence costs on the acquisition. These costs have been mainly included under legal/consultancy
expenses in the group’s 2020 statement of profit or loss.

**(7.1.4) Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed**

Recognised assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are summarised below:

**Net identifiable assets and liabilities . . . . . . . . . . .** **9,146** **2,286** **11,432**

Leases recognised in accordance IFRS 16 resulted in right-of-use assets of €1,271 thousand and lease
liabilities of the same amount broken down into current and non-current financial liabilities of
€297 thousand and €974 thousand, respectively.

Defined benefit plans for acquired employees amount to €3,006 thousand, which reflects the present
value of the estimated final cost of the benefits, calculated using the projected unit credit method by an
actuary specifically engaged to calculate this amount at the acquisition date.

The fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment refers to the adjustment to the fair value
of the purchased building and land on which the production facility stands. This adjustment was based on
the technical appraisal by the group’s independent expert during the due diligence.

The fair value adjustment to inventories was recognised to adjust the carrying amount of purchased
inventories to their market value.

Goodwill recognised in these consolidated financial statements will not be deductible for income tax
purposes.

The goodwill resulting from the acquisition mainly refers to the skills and technical knowledge of the
Closurelogic GmbH business staff.

**(7.2) Subscription of a non-controlling interest in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd**

On February 26, 2020, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalised the
subscription of a 20% interest in the share capital of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd, an innovative technology
services agency based in London.

Founded in 2015 as the first IoT agency, SharpEnd is a pioneering partner in technological creativity.
This company was set up to bridge the gap between products and customers. Its global customers include
AB-InBev, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever and Pernod Ricard.

The agreement between SharpEnd and the Guala Closures Group aims to offer innovative turnkey
solutions, integrating hardware and software into e-packaging solutions.

The capital subscribed by converting the £250 thousand loan granted to the company in December
2019 and by paying £750 thousand in 2020 comprises preference shares accounting for 20% of the
company’s fully diluted share capital.

Under the agreements reached, the Guala Closures Group can increase its investment by subscribing
specific capital increases and can also recover its investment.

The investment in the associate SharpEnd, with an initial carrying amount of €1.3 million, is
periodically adjusted according to the equity method.

**(7.3) Sale of 100% of GCL Pharma S.r.l.**

On April 9, 2020 the group finalised the agreement for the sale to Bormioli Pharma Group of 100% of
GCL Pharma S.r.l. held by the Guala Closures Group through its parent Guala Closures S.p.A..

The consideration for the sale of 100% of the quota capital of GCL Pharma S.r.l. was agreed at
€9.3 million, of which €7.3 million was collected in April 2020 with the remaining €2.0 million to be
collected within one year of the date of finalisation of the sale.

These consolidated financial statements reflect the accounting effects of this sale. Specifically, the
statement of profit or loss for 2020 includes the results of GCL Pharma from January 1, 2020 to March 31,
2020, the date on which the assets and liabilities held by GCL Pharma were classified as held for sale, and
includes the €2.8 million gain on sale.

Since it is not a separate business unit within the group, the investee was not considered a
discontinued operation.

**(7.4) Acquisition of a non-controlling interest in Guala Closures France S.a.s. via capital increase**

As a result of the losses incurred in prior years, on January 29, 2020 the shareholders decided to zero
the share capital of Guala Closures France S.a.s., with a simultaneous resolution to increase the share
capital by €2,748 thousand.

**(7) Acquisitions of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests (Continued)**

As the other non-controlling investors—Les Muselets du Val de Loire M.V.L. S.A.S. and SACI
S.à r.l.—decided not to subscribe the capital increase, the latter was fully subscribed by Guala Closures
International B.V., which, to this end, waived part of the amount due from the French company,
converting the loan into share capital.

The capital increase was completed in February 2020, resulting in the Dutch subsidiary owning Guala
Closures France S.a.s. in full.

Consequently, equity attributable to non-controlling interests recognised in accordance with the
group’s accounting policies at December 31, 2019 (€783 thousand) was reclassified, increasing the group’s
equity.

**(7.5) Acquisition of 100% of Closurelogic Ambalaj Ve kapak Sistemleri San. Ve Tic. Ltd. Sti, a Turkish**
**company**

**(7.5.1) Introduction**

To acquire Closurelogic’s assets (see note 6.1), the German subsidiary Guala Closures Deutschland
GmbH had signed an agreement for the acquisition of Closurelogic Ambalaj Ve kapak Sistemleri San. Ve
Tic. Ltd. Sti., subject to certain conditions precedent that would minimise the buyer’s liability (such as the
conversion of the existing shareholder loan into share capital, the company’s conversion from an LLC to a
joint stock company, the change of the company’s name, etc.). It was acquired on September 4, 2020 for
€315 thousand, after having deducted from the initially agreed price certain trade payables that the buyer
learned of only after the agreement had been signed.

**(7.5.2) Consideration transferred**

The consideration transferred at the acquisition date amounts to €171 thousand, calculated as the
agreed consideration of €315 thousand, net of cash acquired of €144 thousand.

**(7.5.3) Transaction costs**

The group had incurred transactions costs of roughly €0.1 million at December 31, 2020.

**(7.5.4) Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed**

Recognised assets acquired and liabilities assumed are summarised below:

Fair values were calculated on a provisional basis and at the reporting date.

The provisional determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date
when 100% of the company was acquired (September 4, 2020), reflects the impairment of intangible assets,
as they refer to leasehold improvements that are not recoverable, the adjustment of trade receivables to

their estimated realisable value, the adjustment of inventories to their market value, the impairment of the
tax assets for VAT credits that the group does not believe will be recoverable and the accrual to the
provisions for risks of liabilities assumed in connection with contractual charges.

Recognising leases acquired in accordance with IFRS 16 entailed the recognition of right-of-use assets
of €41 thousand and related lease liabilities of the same amount, recognised as current financial liabilities.

**(7.5.5) Goodwill**

The provisional determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition
generated goodwill from a bargain purchase. This goodwill was recognised as follows:

**Provisional goodwill arising from the acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(487)**

In consideration of the limited period of time between the date of the business combination and the
date of 31 December 2020 of these consolidated financial statements, in relation to the complexity of the
process of allocating the purchase values to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and potential liabilities
assumed by the Company and the longer term of 12 months from the date of the business combination
allowed by the relevant legislation precisely because of the aforementioned complexity, in the present
consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2020, a badwill was provisionally recorded under the
item “Other revenues” for an amount equal to € 487 thousand, corresponding to the difference between
the consideration transferred for the purchase of the company shares (€ 315 thousand) and the net assets
of the Company (€ 802 thousand).

If, within one year from the acquisition date, new information relating to facts and circumstances
existing at the acquisition date is acquired which will lead to adjustments to the amounts indicated or to
any additional provisions existing at the acquisition date, the valuation of the acquisition will be revised.

Market warrants are listed instruments which are recognised under current financial liabilities. The
financial expense related to their fair value refers to the change in the official price of these instruments
set by Borsa Italiana during the reporting period. An increase in the official price generates financial
expense (as in 2020, whereas in 2019 it was financial income) since it results in an increase of the
underlying financial liability.

Financial expense on financial liabilities to non-controlling investors refers to the recognition of the increase
in the financial liabilities for these investors’ right to exercise a put option if certain conditions are met. The
liability was determined by discounting the estimated value of the put option at its expected time of exercise.

**(25) Investments in associates**

This caption amounts to €1.0 million at December 31, 2020 and is entirely comprised of the
investment in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd, an innovative technology services agency based in London (UK).

The capital subscribed by converting the £250 thousand loan granted to the company in December
2019 and by paying another £750 thousand in 2020 comprises preference shares accounting for 20% of the
company’s fully diluted share capital.

Under the agreements reached, the Guala Closures Group can increase its investment by subscribing
specific capital increases and can also recover its investment.

The investment in the associate SharpEnd, with an initial carrying amount of €1.3 million, was
impaired to reflect the company’s loss in 2020 between the capital subscription date and the reporting date.

In 2020, net capex of €31.0 million mainly refers to plant and machinery across all five continents
where the group operates, with a specific focus on Europe at the facilities in Italy, Poland and Ukraine.

In Italy, capex was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, new product development and
extraordinary plant maintenance.

In Poland, capex mainly consisted of increasing production capacity.

In Ukraine, capex mainly consisted of increasing production capacity, plant safety and extraordinary
plant maintenance.

Furthermore, Europe saw capex for new product development at the facilities in France and Bulgaria
and the research centre in Luxembourg and for extraordinary maintenance on plants in the UK, Spain and
Germany.

In Asia, capex targeted, in particular, the Indian facilities for extraordinary plant maintenance and
new product development.

In Latam-US, the main capex focused on the Mexican facility with projects mainly for plant safety and
extraordinary maintenance. Smaller investments were also made in all the other facilities across the region.

In Africa, capex related to extraordinary maintenance on plants in South Africa and the increase in
production capacity at the facility in Kenya.

In Australia and New Zealand, capex mainly consisted of maintenance for negligible amounts.

After Guala Closures S.p.A. exercised the purchase option on a building it leased, €9.4 million was
reclassified from right-of-use assets to property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment include the cost of internal work capitalised.

None of the group’s property, plant and equipment has been pledged as collateral at year end, except
for the items indicated in note 39) Commitments and guarantees.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**(28) Intangible assets (Continued)**

The reduction in intangible assets compared to December 31, 2019 mainly refers to amortisation of
2020 (approximately €19.9 million), the negative translation effect (€18.1 million; for additional
information reference should be made to the note to Equity), the sale of GCL Pharma’s assets on
March 31, 2020 (roughly €3.6 million) and the impairment losses on the group’s proprietary patents to
adjust them to their value in use (€3.4 million), partly offset by the increase due to the assets acquired (€0.9
million) in the acquisition of Guala Closures Deutschland in February 2020 and Guala Closures Turkey in
September 2020 and capital expenditure of the year.

Licences and patents mainly refer to the Guala Closures trademark and the group’s proprietary
patents and Other mostly refers to business relationships with customers.

Goodwill increased due to the goodwill arising on the purchase price allocation procedure for the
business acquired by the group in Germany. Reference should be made to note 7.1 for further details.

As indicated in Note (2) Accounting policies, goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment.
Since its recognition on July 31, 2018, goodwill has never been impaired.

The group checks the recoverability of goodwill at least once a year, or more frequently if specific
events or circumstances indicate impairment, by testing each CGU (cash-generating unit).

From an accounting point of view, the Covid-19 emergency, as also referred to by ESMA (European
Securities and Market Authority), configures an impairment indicator and therefore the Group has
carefully checked the potential impacts on the recoverability of the values recognized as intangible assets
and start-up. As indicated in note 4) Covid-19, the current Covid-19 pandemic has affected sales volumes
in 2020 due to the contagion containment policies and specifically plant closures, prohibitions on alcohol
consumption, restrictions to the movement and temporary closure of the on-premises consumption
channel and at the same time demonstrated a strong resilience of the off-premises channels with an
increase in household consumption.

Goodwill recoverability is tested at consolidated level, considering Guala Closures Group as a single
CGU. Indeed:

   - Guala has a single, integrated investment strategy at group level, pursued on the basis of centralised
cost/benefit analyses that maximise the return on investment for the entire Guala Closures Group,
while taking into account the performance objectives of the individual legal entities;

   - by virtue of the centralised strategy described above, the investments of the individual legal entities
are subject to the group approval in accordance with its strategy;

   - strategic guidance and coordination activities are carried out centrally by a single management
team;

   - consistency with the representation of the group’s financial results provided to the market is
ensured. In particular, the results and the KPIs are disclosed at consolidated level, while for the
individual legal entities only the figures relating to revenue are shown.

The CGU identified by the group to monitor goodwill coincides with the level of aggregation of
operations set out in IFRS 8—Operating segments which, for the group, is the Closures division.

Goodwill allocated to the Closures CGU was successfully tested for impairment at the reporting date.
Consequently, no impairment loss was recognised on goodwill at December 31, 2020.

The recoverability of the recognised amounts is tested by comparing the net invested capital (carrying
amount) of the CGU with the related recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of goodwill is equal to
value in use, i.e., the present value of the operating cash flows which arise from the forecasts included in
the long-term plans approved by the group (budget 2021 and business plan 2022-2025), consistent with the
Group’s business model and with the duration of its products and the normalised terminal value, used to
express a summary estimate of future figures over the explicit given timeframe. These cash flows are
subsequently discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the group asset or CGU.

**(28) Intangible assets (Continued)**

The discounted cash flow model is based on the cash flow projections for five years based on the
business plan approved by the board of directors on March 9, 2021 which envisages a CAGR of net
revenue and EBITDA of 4.3% and 7.5%, respectively. The terminal growth rate was determined based on
management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the
assumption that a market participant would make. Such growth rate is consistent with the inflation
expected in the countries in which the group operates weighted by revenue for the geographical segment.

In the 2020 valuation, the following assumptions were used:

   - the WACC for the Closures division was weighted by the net revenue percentage by destination
market of each country in respect of the consolidated net revenue, with a weighted average of 7.4%;

   - long-term growth rate “g”: a value of 2.5% was used calculated by weighting the estimated inflation
rate for each country (source Economist-December 2020) by the impact of net revenue by
destination market on total net revenue, in line with the terminal value calculation.

The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the past history and the industry
weighted-average cost of capital, with a possible percentage of indebtedness of 39% at a market interest
rate of 2.6%.

The division’s estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by €343 million (2019: €55
million). The positive change in the surplus value identified in the recoverable amount compared to the
previous year derives from the general reduction in financial parameters while the net change in the other
assumptions (such as cash flows deriving from the plan and the change in perimeter) does not have a
significant effect.

The estimates and plan figures to which the above parameters are applied are calculated by
management based on past experience and the expected developments of the markets in which the group
operates at the reporting date. To this end, the current international macro-economic situation, the
possible economic-financial impacts and the current downturn due to the health emergency, may result in
uncertain scenarios in terms of achieving the objectives and levels of activity set out in the plan.

In particular, the current Covid-19 pandemic has affected sales volumes in 2020 due to the infection
containment policies (specifically, the shuttering of facilities, bans on alcohol consumption, restricted
travel and temporary block on on-premises consumption). Despite the expected easing of these measures
by 2021 and a progressive improvement in market conditions given the containment measures of the
pandemic in progress, the growing diffusion of the availability of vaccines (although still uncertain in its
timing), the presence of Group differentiated in the various countries, the estimate of these effects over
the plan years is subject to extreme uncertainty, especially in the time horizon in which it is realistic to
return to pre-Covid cash flows.

For this reason, given the positive recovery demonstrated in the second half of 2020 and the
substantial resilience of the business model in the Group, the plan was drawn up on the assumption that
the Covid-19 pandemic has no effects on the plan (Covid-19 free) and in continuity with the previous
business plan, effectively sterilizing this effect and assuming cash flows determined on the basis of the
Group’s supply capacity, its ability to absorb any drops in turnover through containment measures costs
and investments, from the very close relationships with its customers and on the potential of the reference
market historically characterized by constant and countercyclical organic growth rates. In addition to the
recurrent sensitivity analysis, and in order to assess the effect of the Covid-19 impacts of 2020 on the entire
plan period, a “stress test” was carried out which provides for a reduction in EBITDA over the entire
period of the plan and on the terminal in the hypothesis, very conservative approach, that the effects of the
pandemic could have permanent effects on the volumes of the group’s activities: the reduction in EBITDA
that would make the recoverable value of the CGU equal to its carrying amount at 31 December 2020 is
15.69 %, a value higher than the negative change recorded in 2020 compared to 2019 (-12.3% on a
like-for-like basis; -13.7% on a current basis).

The group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis of changes in the WACC and ‘g’ rates.
Specifically, the WACC and the ‘g’ rates which, individually, would make the CGU’s recoverable amount

**at December 31, 2020**

**(28) Intangible assets (Continued)**

equal to its carrying amount at December 31, 2020 are 8.4% and 0.7%, respectively. In addition, an
increase in the WACC of 0.5% would lead to a reduction in headroom of €139 million, while a reduction in
the growth rate of 0.5% would lead to a reduction in headroom of €118 million.

These sensitivity analyzes highlighted the Group’s low vulnerability to the effects of the crisis in the
medium term and resilience in the ability to generate income in the long term.

This aspect highlights even more the weight of the TV (Terminal Value) in the estimate of the value
in use carried out for the purposes of the impairment test; in fact, the incidence of TV on EV based on the
impairment test carried out as at December 31, 2020 is 82% (80% the incidence of TV on EV as at
31 December 2019). It follows that potential impacts that make it necessary to recognize an impairment of
the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets should derive from an expected reduction in
long-term cash flows considered for the purposes of terminal value, a scenario not considered probable at
the date today.

However, the estimate of goodwill’s recoverable amount requires management’s discretion and use of
estimates, and, therefore, goodwill may be impaired in the future due to presently-unforeseeable changes
in the scenario.

Group management constantly monitors the circumstances and events which may result in an
additional impairment test.

Deferred taxes mainly relate to the Guala Closures Group’s business combination on July 31, 2018.

Specifically, deferred tax liabilities were recognised on the revaluation of the group’s assets as part of
the PPA procedure following their recognition at fair value. Indeed, these revaluations are neutral for tax
purposes.

The higher deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of the business combination of Guala Closures
Group relates to the revaluation of the following assets:

   - intangible assets and, specifically, Trade relationships with customers, Guala Closures trademark
and Patents;

   - property, plant and equipment and, specifically, plant and equipment.

In the year, the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. recognised deferred tax assets of €3.5 million based on
the most recent estimates of taxable income forecast in the 2021-2025 five-year plan, which will make it
possible to use deferred tax assets on prior year tax losses. The parent’s deferred tax assets on tax losses
that it may carry forward total €11.4 million and account for most of the consolidated deferred tax assets
on tax losses.

Tax losses that may be carried forward at December 31, 2020 amount to €192,176 thousand and may
be used according to the legislation in the various countries where the reporting companies are based.

The tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely amount to €173,493 thousand and refer to
Guala Closures S.p.A., Guala Closures Chile S.p.A., Guala Closures France SAS, Guala Closures North
America Inc., Guala Closures UK Ltd. and Guala Closures UCP Ltd.

Based on the most recent estimates of future taxable income, the group recognised deferred tax assets
on tax loss carryforwards of €16,410 thousand, corresponding to estimated future taxable income of
€59,587 thousand, which is considered probable based on the group’s tax planning.

Therefore, tax loss carryforwards not included in the calculation of deferred tax assets recognised in
the group’s statement of financial position at December 31, 2020 total €132,589 thousand, corresponding
to potential deferred tax assets of €31,518 thousand (including €29,001 in tax losses that can be carried
forward indefinitely) if they were recognised.

**(30) Current and non-current financial liabilities**

loans and bonds.

**(30) Current and non-current financial liabilities (Continued)**

Reference should be made to note 38) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for
further information on the group’s exposure to interest and currency risks.

On July 20, 2018, the parent entered into a revolving credit facility agreement governed by the laws of
England and Wales with UniCredit Bank AG, Milan Branch, as agent, and the original lenders (Credit
Suisse International, Banco BPM S.p.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and Unicredit S.p.A.)
for a maximum amount of €80 million (the “New RCF”) at the 3M Euribor/GBP Libor + 2.5% (zero
floor). The New RCF will expire on February 28, 2024.

On October 3, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. issued floating rate bonds of €445 million (3M Euribor +
3.5%—zero floor) due in 2024 (the “Bonds”) under an indenture contract governed by the laws of the
State of New York. The contract was signed, inter alia, by Guala Closures S.p.A., as the issuer, The Law
Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c., as the senior secured notes trustee and Bondholders’ representative
pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, Deutsche Bank AG, London branch, as the
paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as the transfer agent and the registrar (the
“Indenture”).

The parent has, inter alia, a covenant on the New RCF. Failure to comply with it may require the
parent to repay the facility earlier, should the New RCF be drawn by more than 40% of its total amount
(€80 million). Under this covenant, the ratio of the parent’s indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, both
calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions of the New RCF, shall not exceed 6.40x.

Under this agreement, the parent’s Treasury department is required to constantly monitor the
covenant and to regularly report to management and the lending bank in order to ensure compliance. At
December 31, 2020, not more than 40% of the facility has been used, which is the trigger for the
application of the covenant. In any case, the covenant is complied with.

Lastly, the contract governing the New RCF and the terms of the Bonds provide for change of control
clauses. Specifically, the threshold that determines a change of control according to the New RCF is 35%
of voting rights at Guala Closures shareholders’ meetings, while the same threshold under the Bond
regulation is 50% of voting rights.

Considering the situation that could arise following (i) the potential finalisation of the agreements
indicated in the information released by Special Packaging Solutions Investments S.à r.l. (“SPSI”) on
December 8, 2020 and (ii) the outcome of the consequent mandatory public offer for Guala Closures
ordinary shares, the parent is monitoring developments in the situation, so as to take the appropriate
action if the circumstances envisaged by the change of control clause arise.

**(30) Current and non-current financial liabilities (Continued)**

Other financial liabilities include the fair value of the market warrants at December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019 (€5,965 thousand and €3,873 thousand, respectively). The difference between the fair
value at December 31, 2020 and that at December 31, 2019 was recognised in the statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income for the year, under financial expense (€2,092 thousand). The impact
on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year is attributable to the
increase in the market price of the market warrants, which went from €0.20 at December 31, 2019 to €0.31
at December 31, 2020.

On the date of their first trading, the parent recognised 10,000,000 market warrants, traded separately
to the shares, for an amount of €6,000,000, by setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount
(described in note 35) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent). Furthermore, on August 6, 2018,
the date the merger became effective, another 9,367,393 market warrants were assigned for €9,367,393,
setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount. The warrants were assigned free of charge in the
ratio of four market warrants to every 10 ordinary shares. They can be exercised against payment as
resolved by the shareholders in their extraordinary meetings of September 26, 2017 and November 16,
2017.

Based on the market warrant regulation, the warrant holders may decide to exercise them in whole or
in part at any time and to subscribe the exchange shares at the subscription price, as long as the average
monthly price is higher than the strike price (€10 per share). The subscription price of €0.10 per exchange
share was approved by the shareholders on September 26, 2017 based on the amendments introduced on
October 26, 2017. The parent will publish the acceleration communication should the average monthly
price be the same as or higher than €13 per share.

As a result, the holders of the market warrants will be assigned exchange shares based on the
following exchange ratio:

_Average monthly price – Strike price_
_Average monthly price – Subscription price_

Warrants not exercised by the expiry date are taken to have been extinguished and are no longer valid
when by expiry date is meant the first of the following dates: (i) the first trading date after five years from
the relevant transaction’s effective date and (ii) the first trading date after 60 calendar days from the date
of publication of the acceleration communication.

Financial liabilities—non-controlling investors relate to recognition of these investors’ right to
exercise a put option if certain conditions are met. It represents the discounted estimated value of the put
option at its expected time of exercise.

This caption has been recognised using the present access method, whereby the financial liability was
recognised as a reduction in equity in the first year. The fluctuation in each year, if any, is recognised
under financial income (expense) in profit or loss and the non-controlling interests continue to be
presented separately as, to all effects, the non-controlling investors have the right to access the profit or
loss pertaining to their investment. Following the PPA procedure, the financial liability was adjusted to
reflect the allocation of the resulting gains attributable to non-controlling investors.

Reference should be made to note 38) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for
further details.

The provision for reorganisation includes:

  - €311 thousand for the downsizing of Guala Closures UK Ltd’s production activities, commenced in
2018, which entails the transfer of plant and machinery from the secondary Broomhill facility to the
main facility in Kirkintilloch. The provision has been calculated considering the cost of terminating
the existing agreements and the benefits due to employees under the related contracts. The
provision is unchanged since the production site has not yet been definitively discontinued.

   - €250 thousand for the company Guala Closures Deutschland and in particular to the early exit of
administrative staff.

   - €87 thousand for the reorganization process of Guala Closures Turkey and in particular to the
provisional estimate of the liabilities assumed upon the acquisition of the equity investment in
relation to liabilities for restoration costs of leased properties and onerous contracts.

**(32) Provisions (Continued)**

The provision for returns reflects the calculation for customer claims received based on the
negotiations in place at the reporting date.

At December 31, 2019, the provision for contingencies and the other provisions were entirely related
to the evaluations carried out during Guala Closures UCP’s PPA procedure whereby the estimated
liabilities acquired as part of the business combination (€282 thousand) were allocated to these provisions.
These liabilities mainly relate to disputes with third parties and charges for safety measures. The value of
these funds as at December 31, 2020 refers in part to the evaluations carried out during Guala Closures
Deutschland’s PPA procedure which led to the allocation of the estimated amount for liabilities acquired
in the business combination (€213 thousand) to these funds staff reorganization processes in progress at
the acquisition date and administrative burdens and, for the remaining part, risks of possible tax liabilities.

The liability for post-employment benefits (“TFR”—Trattamento di fine rapporto) relates to Guala
Closures S.p.A. for employee departures, determined using actuarial techniques and regulated by article
2120 of the Italian Civil Code. The benefit is paid when the employee leaves the company as a lump sum,
the amount of which corresponds to the total benefits accrued during the employees’ service period based
on payroll costs as revalued until their departure. Following the pension reform, from January 1, 2007,
accruing benefits have been transferred to a pension fund or a treasury fund held by Italy’s social security
institution (INPS). Companies with less than 50 employees, can continue the scheme as in previous years.
Therefore, contributions of future TFR to pension funds or the INPS treasury fund entails that these
amounts will be treated as a defined contribution plan. Amounts vested before January 1, 2007 continue to
be accounted for as defined benefits to be assessed based on actuarial assumptions.

Changes in post-employment benefits and the main assumptions used in their measurement are
detailed below:

For valuations at December 31, 2020, an annual fixed discount rate of (0.02%) was used based on the
value of Iboxx indexes AA corporate duration 7- 10 observed at December 31, 2020, as per the
requirements of IAS 19.

The group expects to pay around €0.5 million of benefits to its defined benefit plan in 2021.

**(34) Employee benefits (Continued)**

**Sensitivity analysis:**

Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date, assuming the other variables do not change, would
have affected Guala Closures S.p.A.’s post-employment benefits at December 31, 2020 by the amounts
shown below:

**Defined benefit obligation**
**(€’000)** **Increase** **Decrease**

Turnover rate (1% variation) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (25) 27
Average inflation rate (0.25% variation) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 (40)
Discount rate (0.25% variation) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (65) 67

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the
plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

Guala Closures UK has a defined benefit pension plan under which the employees of the former
Metalclosures Ltd have the right to a pension. This plan has a surplus at December 31, 2020 (i.e., the fair
value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation). As required by
IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus that can be recognised must be less than the benefits available in the
form of reimbursements or the contribution holiday: following completion of the West Bromwich site
restructuring plan in 2008, the amount of the contribution holiday is zero and, therefore, the English
company has not recognised the fund surplus. In addition, the group did not have contingent liabilities at
the reporting date as the fund covers the present value of its future obligations with its plan assets.

For disclosure purposes, the amounts of the fund obligations and plan assets, as well as the baseline
actuarial parameters used for their calculation, are shown below:

assuming the other variables do not change, would have affected Guala Closures UK’s defined benefit
pension plan at December 31, 2020 by the amounts shown below:


**Impact on fair value of**

**(€’000)**


**Impact on present value**

**(35) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent (Continued)**

The special shares Class C to which, upon issue, 2,500,000 sponsor warrants have been attached, have
the same rights as the ordinary shares, with the sole exception of the following:

   - they do not have voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings;

   - they do not have the right to dividends approved as ordinary dividends;

   - they cannot be transferred until the last day of the twelfth month after the Relevant Transaction
and, should the Relevant Transaction not take place, for the maximum duration of the company as
established by article 4 of the by-laws except for (i) those transferred to the withdrawing
shareholders of Space Holding after the liquidation procedure as payment in kind for the sale of
their investment; and (ii) those transferred to the beneficiary of a proportionate demerger of Space
Holding S.r.l.;

   - if the Company is dissolved, they give the right to their voters to be paid their stake of liquidation
equity after the ordinary shareholders;

   - they give the right to receive two sponsor warrants for every special share issued;

   - when certain conditions are met, the special shares are automatically converted into ordinary
shares, at the ratio of 4.5 ordinary shares for each special share, without the need for their holders
to express their intention to convert and without any change to be made to the amount of share
capital, provided that the conversion will decrease the implicit carrying amount of ordinary shares.

The sponsor warrants attached to the special shares and assigned free of charge in the ratio of two
warrants for every special share subscribed are not traded on the Italian regulated stock market or abroad.

Each sponsor warrant gives its holder the right to subscribe an exchange share if the share’s official
price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, which is the period
between the first trading date after the Relevant Transaction’s effective date and the tenth anniversary of
this date.

Furthermore, on 6 August 2018, 1,000,000 Management Warrants were issued. They can be exercised
as of this date and will entitle holders to one Management Warrant share for every exchangeable
management warrant, provided that the post-merger Guala Closures share’s official price is equal to or
higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, and against payment of a subscription price
per share of Euro 13.

Warrants that have not been exercised at the end of this period irrevocably become ineffective and are
taken to have been extinguished as explained in the related regulations to which reference is made.

At December 31, 2020, equity comprises unavailable reserves for market warrants of €19,367
thousand, of which €6,000 thousand was recognised as a decrease in the share premium reserve following
the capital increase which took place on December 21, 2017 and the concurrent allocation of
10,000 thousand market warrants, and €9,367 thousand was taken as a reduction of other reserves,
following the allocation of the residual 9,367,393 market warrants upon listing and the concurrent merger
on August 6, 2018.

The group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the
group’s future and to support its development.

The group thus seeks to maintain a sufficient level of capitalisation, while giving shareholders
satisfactory returns and ensuring the group has access to external sources of financing at acceptable terms,
including by maintaining an adequate rating.

The group monitors the debt/equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net
indebtedness and cash flows generated by operating activities.

The board of directors carefully monitors the balance between greater returns through the right level
of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position.

To achieve these objectives, the group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable.

approximation of fair values.

**(b) Measurement of fair values**

**_(i) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs_**

The market warrants are measured at fair value through profit or loss and classified under other
financial liabilities. Fair value is calculated based on the market price at period end, considering the price
of the STAR segment of the stock exchange, ISIN: IT0005311813.

Therefore, the following changes in fair value could significantly affect the company’s performance:

   - a rise in the market warrants’ fair values could lead to an increase in the parent’s liabilities and
financial expense;

   - a reduction in the market warrants’ fair values could lead to a decrease in the parent’s liabilities and
an increase in financial income.

These financial income and expense are accounting changes that do not lead to cash inflows or
outflows.

The fair value is
determined considering
the expected payment,
capitalised at the
reporting date, net of the
expected dividend yields,
discounted to present
value using a credit riskadjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is
calculated considering
the fair value of the
subsidiary or its equity
based on the relevant
contractual agreements
with non-controlling
investors.

Market comparison
technique:
The fair values are based
on broker quotes. Similar
contracts are traded in
an active market and the
quotes reflect the actual
transactions of similar
instruments.

Even though secured bond issues are quoted on the OTC market like the Euro-MTF in Luxembourg,
no relevant transactions were recorded during the year and so such financial instrument was classified as
level 2.

**(38) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

_Credit risk_

This is the risk that a customer or the counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to meet an
obligation, leading to a financial loss. These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables and financial
investments.

The group’s exposure to credit risk depends largely on each customer’s specific characteristics. The
demographics of the group’s customer portfolio, including the sector insolvency risk and the country risk,
have an impact on the credit risk.

The group accrues a loss allowance equal to the estimated losses on trade and other loans and
receivables. It comprises both the recognition of impairment losses for material individual amounts and
the recognition of collective impairment for similar groups of assets to cover losses already incurred but
not yet identified. The collective impairment losses are calculated on the basis of historical payment
statistics.

Most of the group’s trade receivables are due from leading operators of the alcoholic and
non-alcoholic beverage segment. Most of its trading relationships are with longstanding customers.

The group reduces its credit risk using supplier financing lines made available by the group’s main
customers, factoring without recourse part of its trade receivables.

The group’s historical figures indicate a modest amount of credit losses. The risk is fully covered by
the corresponding loss allowance recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

There are no cases of particularly concentrated credit risk in geographical terms.

At December 31, 2019 and 2020, trade receivables may be analysed by geographical segment as
follows:

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **95,378** **(2,758)** **92,620**

The group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 90 days are still
collectible, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analyses of the underlying customers’
credit ratings. Based on historical default rates, the group believes that, apart from the above, no loss
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not yet due or past due by up to 90 days.

At December 31, 2020, trade receivables may be analysed by original currency as follows:

_Liquidity risk_

This risk regards the group’s ability to meet its obligations arising from financial liabilities.

The group’s approach to liquidity management is to ensure adequate funds are always available to
meet its obligations at the expiry dates, both in normal conditions and at times of financial difficulty,
without incurring borrowing expense at terms higher than market conditions.

The group generally ensures there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents to cover forecast short-term
operating expenses, including those related to financial liabilities. Contingent effects arising from extreme
situations that cannot reasonably be forecast, such as natural disasters, are excluded from the above.

The aim of Guala Closures Group’s financing strategy is to maintain a well-balanced maturity profile
for liabilities to thereby reduce the refinancing risk. Historically, the group has always met its obligations
on time and has been able to re-finance indebtedness before its expiry.

Reference should be made to the tables in note 30) Current and non-current financial liabilities to
these consolidated financial statements for information on the group’s loans, credit lines and facilities at
the reporting date.

The interest payments on variable interest rate loans and bond issues in the table above and included
in contractual cash flows reflect market forward interest rates at the reporting date and these amounts may
change as market interest rates change. The future cash flows on the put options on non-controlling
interests and derivative instruments may be different from the amount in the above table as interest rates
and exchange rates or the relevant conditions underlying the contingency change. The maturities of the
bond and part of the guaranteed bank loans could change by virtue of change of control clauses (see note
30) Current and non-current financial liabilities to these consolidated financial statements).

Except as previously reported, it is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis
will materialise significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.

_Interest rate risk_

Interest rate risk relates to volatility of the market rates which determine the interest expense paid on
outstanding loans.

The group is exposed to interest rate risk as almost the full amount of its financial liabilities is subject
to the payment of interest at floating rates subject to short-term repricing.

The group does not currently deem it necessary to hedge the portion of the liability subject to interest
rate risk given the current Euribor parameters.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The fair value of financial liabilities was calculated by an external actuary using the following
methodology:

   - the cash flows generated by the outstanding liabilities are identified both in terms of interest and
principal. These cash flows are calculated with reference to the interest rates and the related
repayment plan;

F-118


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2020**

**(38) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

   - the individual cash flows are discounted using risk-free rates ruling on the measurement date. These
rates are deducted from the swap rates using the bootstrap method for each expiry date of the
corresponding cash flow based on the resulting time curve;

   - furthermore the individual cash flows are discounted using an additional rate, based on the group’s
credit standing, calculated as the weighted average of the spreads applied to the different financing
agreements. The spreads applied to the financing agreements are deemed to objectively represent
the group’s credit standing and subsequent significant changes should not arise given its current
financial position.

The following table shows the sensitivity analysis for the cash flows from these financial liabilities and
the related hedging derivatives at December 31, 2020:

**(€’000)** **Increase of 100bp** **Decrease of 100bp**

Senior Revolving Facility Agreement - gross of transaction costs . . . . . . (452) 36

**Sensitivity of cash flows for Bonds and Revolving facility (net) . . . . . . .** **(17,137)** **565**

The following methodology is used to perform the sensitivity analyses: a change is assumed in the
interest rate used to calculate the interest (+/- 100 basis points), which indicates the change in the overall
liability. Accordingly, negative amounts indicate an increase in the fair value of the liability and vice versa
for positive amounts.

_Currency risk_

This risk relates to the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on sales and purchases in currencies
other than the functional currencies of the various group companies.

The group is exposed to currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the US dollar, British
pound, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish zloty.

Interest on loans is denominated in the currency of the cash flows generated by the group’s underlying
transactions.

The risk of exchange fluctuations was managed in the past using currency hedges when significant
differences are noted between cost and revenue in foreign currency and such differences were hedged
through currency swaps. These provided for the purchase/sale of agreed amounts in foreign currency at a
set exchange rate against the Euro.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The appreciation of the Euro, as indicated below, against the USD, GBP, AUD, INR, UAH and PLN
at December 31, 2020 would have increased (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown
below. This analysis is based on exchange rate fluctuations that the group considered to be reasonably
possible at the reporting date. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates,
remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases. The analysis is performed on the
same basis, although the changes in exchange rates differed to those expected, as indicated below.

_Other price risk_

As a result of the nature of its activities, the group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the
purchase price of raw materials, particularly plastics and aluminium.

The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of plastics has not been hedged as these raw materials
were not listed on international markets.

The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of aluminium is partly hedged based on market needs
and outlook through derivatives which set the forward purchase price.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**at December 31, 2019**

**GENERAL INFORMATION**

**(1) General information**

Guala Closures S.p.A. (the “company” or the “parent”) (formerly Space4 S.p.A.) was incorporated by
Space Holding S.r.l. on September 19, 2017 with the name of Space4 S.p.A.. It was a special purpose
acquisition company (SPAC), set up under Italian law as an SIV (special investment vehicle) pursuant to
the Italian stock exchange regulation. Trading began on December 21, 2017.

On July 31, 2018, Space4 S.p.A. acquired Guala Closures S.p.A., the parent of Guala Closures Group
(“pre-merger Guala Closures” or “pre-merger Guala Closures Group”, respectively). On August 6, 2018,
Guala Closures S.p.A. was merged into Space4 S.p.A..

Following the above transaction, the latter company was renamed Guala Closures S.p.A. and the
group headed by Space4 S.p.A. was renamed Guala Closures Group.

Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares set up under Italian law and registered with the
Alessandria commercial register. Its registered office is in via Rana 12, zona industriale D6, Spinetta
Marengo (Alessandria).

Further to the acquisition of pre-merger Guala Closures Group completed by Space4 S.p.A. on
July 31, 2018, the 2018 comparative figures included in these consolidated financial statements comprise
those of just Space4 S.p.A. for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018 and post-merger Guala
Closures Group (i.e., consolidation scope including Space4 S.p.A. and pre-merger Guala Closures Group)
for the period from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Therefore, they cannot be compared with 2019.

These consolidated financial statements reflect the completion of the procedure to allocate the
purchase prices to the identifiable assets acquired, the identifiable liabilities assumed and the
non-controlling interests acquired by Guala Closures Group as part of the acquisition of pre-merger Guala
Closures Group (note 6.1) and the acquisition of United Closures and Plastics (UCP). Consequently, the
December 31, 2018 comparative figures have been restated in order to recognise the effects of the business
combinations that took place on July 31, 2018 (Guala Closures Group) and UCP on December 12, 2018 as
of such dates (note 6.2).

Guala Closures Group’s main activities involve the design and manufacturing of closures for spirits,
wine and non-alcoholic beverages such as water, olive oil and vinegar, as well as pharma products to be
sold mainly on international markets.

The group is also active in the production of PET plastic preforms and bottles.

The group’s activities are separated into two divisions:

   - the Closures division, representing the group’s core business, specialised in the production of Safety
closures (safety product line), customised closures (luxury product line), aluminium closures (wine
product line), roll-on closures (standard product line) and closures for the pharmaceutical and
other sectors;

   - the PET division, which produces PET bottles and miniatures. This division is no longer considered
a core business and, as a result of the reorganisation which entailed the sale of part of the assets and
the transfer of the residual ones from Spain to the United Kingdom during the year, the division is
now closely connected to the Closures division as its customers and those of the Closure division’s
Spirit sector are the same and because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory
market related to the sale of closures to group customers.

Currently, the group is the European and international leader in the production of safety closures for
spirits bottles, with over 60 years’ experience in the sector.

It is also the leading European producer of aluminium closures for spirits bottles.

**(2) Accounting policies**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

The consolidated financial statements of Guala Closures S.p.A. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2019 are the first set of annual consolidated financial statements which cover the group’s 12-month
operations after Guala Closures Group was acquired by Space4 S.p.A. on July 31, 2018.

The comparative figures at December 31, 2018 include the 12-month operations of Space 4 S.p.A. and
the 5-month operations of Guala Closures Group, i.e., between July 31, 2018 and December 31, 2018.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euros, rounding the amounts to the
nearest thousand. Any discrepancies between the consolidated financial statements balances and those in
the tables of these notes are due exclusively to the rounding and do not alter their reliability or substance.
Figures are shown in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise stated.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for
derivatives, market warrants and contingent consideration arising in a business combination (i.e., the put
option on non-controlling interests) which are measured at fair value, and on a going concern basis. There
are no business risks and/or any identified uncertainties which may cast doubts on the group’s ability to
continue as a going concern.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the following formats:

   - statement of financial position captions are classified by current and non-current assets and
liabilities;

   - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) captions are classified by
nature;

   - the statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method;

   - the statement of changes in equity has been prepared in accordance with the structure of changes in
equity.

For each asset and liability caption including amounts due within and after one year, the amount
which is expected to be received or paid after one year is shown.

Pursuant to Consob resolution no. 15519 of July 27, 2006 on financial statements, significant related
party transactions and non-recurring items have been indicated separately in the consolidated financial
statements.

**a)** **Accounting for business combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is
the date on which control is transferred to the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the group
takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.

The group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:

   - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus

   - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus if the business
combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less

   - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the
other income caption.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of preexisting
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities,
that the group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the
contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within
equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in
profit or loss.

When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards
held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the
amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the
business combination. This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement
awards compared with the market-based measure of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the
replacement awards relate to past and/or future service.

**Accounting for acquisitions of non-controlling interests**

Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their
capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The
adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the
subsidiary.

Changes in the group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions.

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.

**Loss of control**

When the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or
loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value
when control is lost.

**Consolidation procedures**

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for each reporting period using the same
accounting policies as those of the parent. Consolidation adjustments are recognised to make those
captions impacted by the application of different accounting policies consistent. All intragroup balances
and transactions, including any unrealised profits on transactions within the group, are completely
eliminated. Unrealised losses, other than impairment losses, are eliminated. The related tax effects are
measured on all consolidation adjustments.

The group companies are listed below, stating name, registered office, share/quota capital, direct and
indirect investments held by the parent and each subsidiary and method of consolidation at December 31,
2019.

Note:

(*) Reference should be made to the chart illustrating the group structure for further details on the indirect investments.

The table does not include the figures for Metal Closures Group Trustee Ltd. (the company that
manages the Metal Closures pension schemes) as they are not consolidated due to their immaterial size.

**(b) Use of estimates and judgments**

Management has to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
accounting policies and the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and revenue. Estimates and the
related assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered to be reasonable in the
circumstances. They are adopted to estimate the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot easily
be assumed from other sources. However, as they are estimates, the actual figure may not match the result
of the estimate. Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of
resulting in a material adjustment in the next financial year is included in the following notes: loss
allowance (note (p) estimated expected credit loss) and allowance for inventory write-down (note 22
inventory estimated recoverability), amortisation/depreciation and impairment of non-current assets
(notes (i) (k) estimated useful life), employee benefits (note 31 estimated actuarial assumptions), taxes
(note 17 estimated future taxable income), provisions (note 29), measurement of financial derivatives,
effects of business combinations (note 6 estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities), market
warrants (note 27 estimated fair value of market warrants), financial liabilities to non-controlling investors
(note 27 fair value put option).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Such estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Any changes arising therefrom are recognised
in the year in which the review takes place if this only affects that year. If the review relates to both current
and future years, the change is recognised in the year in which the review takes place.

**(c) Changes in accounting standards**

Except for that set out below, the accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated
financial statements are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of Guala
Closures Group at December 31, 2018, to which reference should be made.

New applicable standards

The new standards and/or amendments thereto applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on
or after January 1, 2019 are set out below:

  - IFRS 16 Leases

  - IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

  - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9)

  - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amdendments to IAS 28)

  - Plan Amendments, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments to IAS 19)

  - Annual improvements to IFRS’s 2015-2017 Cycle (Amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and
IAS 23)

The only standard that had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements has been the
IFRS 16 Leases.

**IFRS 16 Leases**

The group has applied IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. Other new standards became applicable
on the same date but did not have a significant impact on the group’s consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 16 introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to
make lease payments. The accounting model for lessors has not changed substantially from the IAS 17
model.

Guala Closures Group has elected to apply the modified retrospective approach whereby the
comparative figures are not adjusted and no FTA effects were recognised in the reserves at January 1,
2019. Therefore, the comparative figures for 2018 are presented in line with those reported in the
consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 prepared in accordance with IAS 17.

**A. Definition of a lease**

Prior to application of IFRS 16, Guala Closures Group determined whether a contract was, or
contained, a lease at the inception date in accordance with IFRIC 4—Determining Whether an
Arrangement Contains a Lease. The group now determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease
based on the new definition of IFRS 16. Specifically, the new standard establishes that a contract is or
contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of
time in exchange for consideration.

**B. Leases in which the group is a lessee**

The group has recognised new assets and liabilities for its operating leases (as per the definition of
IAS 17) of land, warehouse and factory facilities, production lines, vehicles used within the facilities and IT
hardware.

The nature of expenses related to those leases has changed because the group recognises a
depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities and no longer has lease

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

payments.

Previously, the group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between
actual lease payments and the expense recognised.

Short-term leases, i.e., with a term of less than 12 months, and leases for which the underlying asset is
of low value, which have been excluded from the scope of IFRS 16 as per the practical expedient, are
recognised as operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**i. Recognition and measurement**

The group recognises a right-of-use asset, separately from property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets, and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease, which is the date on which
the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use to the lessee.

The group initially measures the right-of-use asset at cost and subsequently at cost less any
accumulated depreciation/amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, adjusted for any
remeasurement of the lease liability.

It depreciates/amortises the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end
of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

The group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at the commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the
lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the group uses the
incremental borrowing rate of the lessee (the group company) or the group.

The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and decreased to
reflect the lease payments made.

The group remeasures the lease liability to reflect changes in the in-substance fixed or variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate used to determine those payments, in any residual value
guarantees provided to the lessor by the lessee or, if appropriate, there is a change in the assessment of
whether the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise a purchase or extension option or it is reasonably
certain it will not exercise a termination option.

The lessee considered the renewal options when determining the lease term and, specifically,
considered as reasonably certain the exercise of the first renewal option which may be included in the
lease. With respect to leases that do not contain annual automatic renewal options, the group considered
the lease term based on the time horizon of the business plan prepared by group management (five years),
assuming that this time horizon properly reflects a period of time adequate to assess the lease term with a
reasonable certainty. Assessment of the reasonable certainty of exercising the renewal option affects the
lease term which, in turn, significantly affects the lease liability and the right-of-use asset.

**ii. First-time adoption (FTA)**

Guala Closures Group elected to adopt the modified retrospective approach under which the
comparative figures are not restated and there were no FTA effects on the reserves at January 1, 2019.

It also elected to adopt the following simplifications and practical expedients provided by IFRS 16 to
decrease the costs of FTA:

   - exclusion from the list of leases identified as being, or containing, a lease at the date of initial
application (January 1, 2019) of short-term leases, i.e., with a term of less than 12 months, and
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value;

   - with respect to leases identified as finance leases under IAS 17 at the date of initial application
(January 1, 2019), the right-of-use asset and the lease liability are recognised at the carrying
amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 in accordance with
IAS 17;

   - with respect to leases identified as operating leases under IAS 17 at the date of initial application
(January 1, 2019), the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the remaining lease

payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application,
while the right-of-use asset is measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the
amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease.

As a result of the simplifications and practical expedients adopted by the group, there are no effects of
the FTA recognised in the reserves at January 1, 2019.

**C. Leases in which the group is a lessor**

The recognition and measurement of leases as a lessor have not changed from IAS 17. Sub-leases are
classified considering the right-of-use asset of the head lease and not the identified underlying asset.

The group has not made any adjustments due to transition to IFRS 16 for leases where it is the lessor.

**D. Effects on the consolidated financial statements**

At the date of initial application (January 1, 2019), the group recognised the following amounts for
the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases not already recognised under IAS 17.

As noted, the adoption of IFRS 16 has not generated differences to be recognised in the reserves at
January 1, 2019 due to the group’s application of the practical expedients.

The group used the interest rate implicit in the lease to measure the lease liability or if that rate
cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (i.e., the incremental borrowing rate
of the group companies) or alternatively, as a last resort, the group’s incremental borrowing rate.

A reconciliation of the lease liabilities recognised at the date of initial application at January 1, 2019
with the minimum lease payments for non-cancellable leases shown in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements at December 31, 2018 is provided below.

**(d) Foreign currency**

**Functional currency and presentation currency**

The figures stated in the financial statements of each group company are measured using their
functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company
operates. The consolidated financial statements are drawn up in Euros, the parent’s functional and
presentation currency.

**Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of group
companies at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction date.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency at the exchange rate at the same date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Exchange differences are generally
recognised in profit or loss and presented within financial expense.

However, exchange differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in
other comprehensive income:

   - an investment in equity securities designated as at FVOCI;

   - a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent
that the hedge is effective; and

   - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.

**Foreign operations**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising
on acquisition, are translated into euro at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and
expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated
into euro at the exchange rates at the transaction date.

Hyperinflationary economy: since 2018 Argentina has been considered an hyperinflationary economy
as defined by IFRS, specifically IAS 29. Consequently, following Argentina’s inclusion in the list of
hyperinflationary economies, as of July 1, 2018 and effective from January 1, 2018, Guala Closures Group
has applied IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.
At December 31, 2019, the group’s operations in Argentina represented approximately 2% of its revenue,
2% of its operating performance and 1% of its net assets.

Exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation
reserve in equity. However, if the operation is connected to a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the
relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests.
When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the
cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or
loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reallocated to non-controlling interests. When the group disposes of only part of its
investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant
influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

**(f)** **Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost and net realisable value. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of
completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

The production cost of finished goods includes the portions of the costs of raw materials and external
materials and processing, as well as all other direct and indirect production costs reasonably attributable to
the products, excluding financial expense.

Purchase or production cost is calculated on a weighted average cost basis.

Obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories are written down on the basis of their estimated possibility
of use or future realisable value, through an accrual to the specific allowance adjusting the value of
inventories. The amount is reinstated if, in subsequent years, the reasons for the write-down no longer
exist.

**(g) Assets held for sale and disposal groups**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for sale if
it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to
the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories,
financial assets, deferred tax assets or employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in
accordance with the group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as
held-for-sale or held-for-distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in
profit or loss.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer
amortised or depreciated.

**(h) Discontinued operation**

A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s business, the operations and cash flows of
which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the group and which:

   - represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;

   - is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations; or

   - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.

Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation
meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.

When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start
of the comparative year.

**(i)** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognised at historical cost, including directly related ancillary
costs necessary for the use of the asset. Borrowing costs related to loans taken out specifically for
investments in property, plant and equipment are considered part of the carrying amount of the related
assets and, as such, capitalised.

Subsequent expenditure is included in an asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that the future
economic benefits exceeding those determined originally will flow to the group. This expenditure is
depreciated over the related asset’s residual useful life. All other expenditure is expensed in the year in
which it is incurred.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Property, plant and equipment are shown net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses
determined as set out later on.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their
estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally
recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their
useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.

Land is not depreciated.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted if appropriate. The depreciation periods are as follows:

**Depreciation period**

Internal means of transport, electronic equipment and mobile phones . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 – 8

Subsequent expenditure is included in an asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that the future
economic benefits exceeding those determined originally will flow to the group. This expenditure is
depreciated over the related asset’s residual useful life. All other expenditure is expensed in the year in
which it is incurred.

At the time of disposal or when there are no expected future economic benefits from an asset’s use,
the caption is derecognised. Any gain or loss (calculated as the difference between the sales amount and
carrying amount) is taken to profit or loss in the year of derecognition.

**(k) Intangible assets**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is initially recognised at cost. After initial
recognition, goodwill is adjusted for any accumulated impairment losses, determined using the criteria
described in paragraph (p).

_Research expenditure_

Expenditure on research undertaken to gain scientific and technical knowledge and information is
recognised as an expense when incurred.

_Development expenditure_

Development expenditure, which also relates to the application of research findings to a plan or
design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is capitalised when the
product or process is feasible in technical and commercial terms and the group has adequate resources to
complete the development stage and the group has concluded that it will have the ability to use it.

Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost, net of accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses.

_Other intangible assets_

These assets are measured at cost, determined in the same way as described for property, plant and
equipment.

Other intangible assets, which all have a finite useful life, are subsequently shown net of accumulated
amortisation and any impairment losses, determined in the same way as described for property, plant and
equipment.

Useful life is checked annually and, where necessary, any changes are reflected on a prospective basis.

The amortisation periods for intangible assets are as follows:

Subsequent expenditure is included in an asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that the future
economic benefits exceeding those determined originally will flow to the group. This expenditure is
amortised over the related asset’s residual useful life. All other expenditure is expensed in the year in
which it is incurred.

The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an intangible asset is determined as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and carrying amount. It is recognised in profit or loss at the time of
disposal.

**(l)** **Income taxes**

Income taxes comprise current and deferred tax. They are recognised in profit or loss except to the
extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year
and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates
enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from
dividends.

Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends and any interest and penalties imposed by the
tax authorities following their review of the tax position of previous years which found a difference in tax
due.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is
not recognised for:

   - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to
the extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

   - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related
tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. The measurement
of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group
expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

The income tax consequences of dividends are recognised when the dividend is approved.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the group takes into account the impact of
uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The group believes that its
accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors,
including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and
assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become
available that causes the group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities;
such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the year that such a determination is made.

**(m) Financial instruments**

_Recognition and measurement_

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All
other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial
liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly
attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is
initially measured at the transaction price.

_Classification and subsequent measurement_

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI—debt
investment; FVOCI—equity investment; or FVTPL.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its
business model for managing financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on
the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated as at FVTPL:

   - it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;
and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated as at FVTPL:

   - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual
cash flows and selling financial assets; and

   - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the group may irrevocably
elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an
investment-by-investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are
measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets (see paragraph (n)). On initial
recognition, the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to
be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly
reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Financial assets: business model assessment

The group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is
held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is
provided to management. The information considered includes:

   - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.
These include whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income,
maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the
duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale
of the assets;

   - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group’s key managers;

   - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that
business model) and how those risks are managed;

  - how managers of the business are compensated—e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair
value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and

   - the frequency, value and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such
sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are
not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the group’s continuing recognition of the assets.

Financial assets that are held for trading or whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are
measured at FVTPL.

Financial assets: assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk
associated with the principal amount outstanding in a given period and for other basic lending risks and
costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as for the profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the
group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset
contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it
would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the group considers:

   - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;

   - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;

  - prepayment and extension features; and

   - terms that limit the group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the
contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium on its contractual
par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the
contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable
additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of
the prepayment feature is immaterial at initial recognition.

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Financial assets: subsequent measurement and gains and losses

##### Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and
losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in
profit or loss. See note (n) for derivatives designated as hedging
instruments.
##### Financial assets measured at These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the amortised cost effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by
impairment losses. Interest income, exchange gains and losses and
impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on
derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
##### Debt investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest
income calculated using the effective interest method, exchange
gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On
derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified
to profit or loss.
##### Equity investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends
are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend
clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never
reclassified to profit or loss.

Financial liabilities: classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is
classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on
initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses,
including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and exchange gains and
losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

See note (n) for financial liabilities designated as hedging instruments.

_Derecognition_

Financial assets

The group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in
which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in
which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it
does not retain control of the financial asset.

The group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial
position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these
cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

Financial liabilities

The group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged cancelled
or expire. The group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows
of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the
modified terms is recognised at fair value.

F-149


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and
the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in
profit or loss.

_Offsetting_

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

**(n) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk
exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the
host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are
measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.

The group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows
associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in exchange rates and interest
rates and certain derivatives and non-derivative financial liabilities as hedges of currency risk on a net
investment in a foreign operation.

At the inception of designated hedging relationships, the group documents the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The group also documents the economic relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.

Cash flow hedges

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in
the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative
change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or
loss.

The group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts
as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships. The change in fair value of the forward
element of forward exchange contracts (‘forward points’) is separately accounted for as a cost of hedging
and recognised in a costs of hedging reserve within equity.

When the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item
such as inventories, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve is
included directly in the initial cost of the non-financial item when it is recognised.

For all other hedged forecast transactions, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the
cost of hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same year or years during which the hedged
expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold,
expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge
accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging
reserve remains in equity until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in the recognition of a non-financial
item, it is included in the non-financial item’s cost on its initial recognition or, for other cash flow hedges, it
is reclassified to profit or loss in the same year or years as the hedged expected future cash flows affect
profit or loss.

F-150


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been
accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit
or loss.

**(o) Share capital and equity**

_Ordinary shares_

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary
shares are recognised as a decrease in equity, net of any tax effects.

_Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)_

When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which
includes directly attributable costs is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are
classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold
or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting
surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.

_Business combinations_

When as a result of a takeover/acquisition of control not involving the entire stake in the acquiree, the
group has the potential obligation to acquire the residual investment in the acquiree should the
non-controlling investors exercise a put option and the non-controlling investor still has present access to
the economic benefit associated with the underlying ownership interests, it recognises a liability calculated
by discounting the estimated value at the exercise date using the present access method whereby a liability
is recognised decreasing the equity caption “Retained earnings (losses carried forward)” in the first year,
with subsequent remeasurement recognised in profit or loss as financial expense.

_Warrants_

Warrants are recognised in accordance with the conditions set out in the relevant regulations
governing their operation.

_Warrants with fixed conversion parameter_

Some warrants (sponsor warrants and management warrants) have fixed and predetermined
subscription prices and exercise ratios at the date of issue within predefined time windows. In these cases,
the warrant regulation provides for the number of shares that will be issued and the price (if any) that the
holder must pay to the company on the date of exercise of the warrants. These instruments are accounted
for by the group as equity instruments.

_Warrants with variable conversion parameter_

Some warrants (market warrants) have a conversion ratio that varies over time and according to the
variability of the market price of the underlying share and other parameters provided for in the relevant
regulation. Despite the variability of the conversion ratio, the expiry date of the warrant is brought forward
when certain thresholds of the price of the underlying share are achieved (thus representing a cap on its
appreciation) with the right to settle the instrument through the delivery of shares or cash to the bearer of
the rights or to the issuer. Due to the mentioned features, these instruments are considered and classified
as derivative financial liabilities under IFRS 9, the change in fair value are accordingly recognized in the
profit & loss.

**(p) Impairment**

_Non-derivative financial instruments_

Financial instruments and contract assets

The group recognises loss allowances for ECLs on:

   - financial assets measured at amortised cost;

   - contract assets.

The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following,
which are measured as 12-month ECLs:

   - debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and

   - other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over
the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating ECLs, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that
is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative
information and analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and
including forward-looking information.

The group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than
90 days past due.

The group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit
obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as enforcing a security (if any
is held).

Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a
financial instrument.

12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the
12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than
12 months).

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over
which the group is exposed to credit risk.

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present
value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with
the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive).

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt
securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events
that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying
amount of the assets.

For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is partially or fully impaired to the extent the group has
no reasonable expectations of its recovery. For customers, the group individually makes an assessment of

F-152


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The
group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures
for recovery of amounts due.

Non-financial assets

At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets, except for
inventories and deferred tax assets, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected
to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets
in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**(q) Employee benefits**

The group’s net obligation in respect of defined contribution plans relates the post-employment
benefit plans whereby the group companies pay fixed contributions to an entity that is legally separated on
a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis without there being any actual or constructive obligation to
make additional payments if the entity does not hold sufficient assets to pay all accrued pension benefits
relating to current or past services. Contributions payable are recognised in profit or loss on an accruals
basis and classified as personnel expense.

The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the group, the
recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of
economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses, the
return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are
recognised immediately in OCI. The group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net
defined benefit liability (asset) for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined
benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset),
taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the year as a result of

F-153


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit
plans are recognised in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefits
that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement
occurs.

IFRIC 14 clarifies the provisions of IAS 19 “Employee benefits” with respect to the measurement of
defined benefit plan assets when there is a minimum funding requirement. A defined benefit plan is in
surplus when the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
IFRIC 14/IAS 19 only permit the recognition of this surplus at the present value of the financial benefits
available through refunds or reductions in future contributions. Moreover, disclosure is required when the
plan requires a minimum contribution that could give rise to a liability.

For Italian entities, starting from January 1, 2007, the Finance Act (Law no. 296 of December 27,
2006, the “2006 Finance Act”) and the relevant implementation decrees introduced important changes in
the rules governing post-employment benefits (“TFR”), including the need for employees to decide on the
allocation of their future benefits. In particular, this reform established that employees had to transfer the
new amounts of their benefits to established pension funds after January 1, 2007 or leave them with the
company; in the latter case, the company would pay these amounts to a specific INPS (Italian social
security institution) treasury account. Therefore, the post-employment benefits stated in the consolidated
financial statements at the end of the year refer to the amount due to employees, not yet paid but vested
up to December 31, 2006.

**(r) Provisions**

Provisions include certain or probable costs and charges, the amount or due date of which is unknown
at year end. A provision is recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow from the group of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation. The
provisions are stated as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the
reporting date or to transfer it to a third party at that date. If the impact of discounting the time value of
money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. Where discounting is
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as financial expense.

**(s) Revenue**

The group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers since January 1, 2018.
Specifically, IFRS 15 introduced a new model for revenue recognition based on the following five steps:

   - identify the contract(s) with a customer

   - identify the performance obligations in the contract;

   - determine the transaction price;

   - allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

   - recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

Revenue is recognised, net of returns, discounts, rebates and bonuses, as well as taxes directly related
to the sale of products and the provision of services. They are measured taking into account the
consideration specified in the contract with the customer. The group, which generally operates as principal,
recognises revenue when it transfers control of the goods or services (point in time). Control of the safety
and standard closures is transferred to the customers when the goods are delivered to their premises, i.e.,
when the goods are taken over by the carrier selected by the customer if earlier and, accordingly, the group
recognises the related revenue at such times. There are generally no further contractual obligations for the
group.

F-154


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

There are no significant discounts for final customers and there are no contracts which enable
customers to return products (with the exception of faulty goods or replacements of damage goods that are
accounting for in the Provision for returns) in exchange for new ones or cash reimbursements.

Usually, no costs are incurred to obtain or perform contracts with customers.

**(t) Government grants**

Grants relating to assets and income are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the group
will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received. Grants related to
assets are recognised as deferred revenue under Other liabilities in the statement of financial position and
are taken to profit or loss on a systematic basis to offset them against the depreciation of the relevant
assets. Grants relating to income are recognised under Other operating income.

**(u) Financial income and expense**

The group’s financial income and finance expense include:

   - interest income;

   - interest expense;

  - dividend income;

   - dividends on preference shares classified as financial liabilities;

   - the net gain or loss on the disposal of investments in debt securities measured at FVOCI;

   - the net gain or loss on financial assets at FVTPL;

   - the exchange gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities;

   - impairment losses (and reversals) on investments in debt securities carried at amortised cost or
FVOCI;

   - the gain on the remeasurement to fair value of any pre-existing interest in an acquiree in a business
combination;

   - the fair value loss on contingent consideration classified as a financial liability;

   - hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss; and

   - the reclassification of net gains and losses previously recognised in OCI on cash flow hedges of
interest rate risk and foreign currency risk for borrowings.

Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is
recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the group’s right to receive payment is established.

The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

   - the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or

   - the amortised cost of the financial liability.

In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying
amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If
the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

**(v) Determination of fair value**

‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or the most
advantageous market to which the group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its
non-performance risk.

F-155

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

Several standards and disclosure requirements require the determination of fair value of financial and
non-financial assets and liabilities.

When one is available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an
active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability
take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the group uses valuation techniques that
maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen
valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in
pricing a transaction.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the group
measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the
transaction price—i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the group determines that
the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced
neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation
technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement,
then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between
the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in
profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is
wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in
the valuation techniques as follows:

   - Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

   - Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices);

   - Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are categorised into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the level
of the lowest level input that is significant to measurement.

The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.

**(w) Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable**

The new standards and/or amendments thereto applicable to annual reporting periods ending after
December 31, 2019 are set out below.

A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020 and
earlier application is permitted; however, the group has not early adopted the new or amended standards
in preparing these consolidated financial statements since they are not expected to have a significant
impact thereon:

  - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards. The Conceptual
Framework describes the concepts for financial reporting in accordance with IFRS. It is a practical
tool that helps the IASB to develop new standards, assists preparers of financial statements to
develop consistent accounting policies when no standard applies and assists all parties to
understand and interpret IFRS [CF.SP1.1]. The EU does not endorse the new Conceptual
Framework since this document only provides a conceptual framework of IFRS and is not a
standard. The main changes and innovations include:

      - new concepts for the measurement, presentation, transparency and derecognition of
previously recognised items;

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(2) Accounting policies (Continued)**

      - updates to the definition of assets and liabilities and the recognition of financial assets and
liabilities;

      - greater clarity on the principles of prudence, uncertainties in assessments, substance over
form and directors’ responsibility.

  - Definition of “material” (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8). As part of the Better Communication
in Financial Reporting project, with which the IASB intends to improve the way financial
information is communicated to users of the financial statements, the definition of “material” was
amended. This is a pervasive principle in IFRS and affects not only the recognition, measurement
and presentation of financial statements items, but also the selection of the disclosure in the notes
thereto. Prior to the amendment, the definition of “material” was covered by both paragraph 7 of
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and paragraph 5 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes
in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Following the amendment, this definition was amended and
extended only in the first standard, while the second standard only makes reference to the
definition included in IAS 1.7. The aim of the amendment is to clarify that not all omitted
information is material. Consequently, financial statements preparers are not obliged to provide
mandatorily all disclosures required by the individual standards. Rather, they must provide only
those that are material for financial statements users. Another amendment clarifies that
information is material not only if it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that
the primary users of general purpose financial statements make if omitted or misstated, but also if
concealed. Indeed, the effect would be the same as an omission or misstatement.

  - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7). In this first phase
of the project, the IASB amended IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 to enable entities not to terminate
hedging transactions, until the interest rate benchmark reform is completed. Specifically, it provides
temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements (IFRS 9 and IAS 39) to be
mandatorily applied to all hedging transactions directly affected by the interest rate benchmark
reform.

At the reporting date, the European Union had not yet completed the endorsement process for the
following standards and amendments:

  - IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts

  - IFRS 17—Insurance Contracts

   - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
(Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)

  - Definition of business (Amendments to IFRS 3)

   - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)

**(4) Brexit**

The group carries out a considerable part of its business in the United Kingdom and this has increased
since its acquisition of the Scottish company United Closures and Plastics (“UCP”) in 2018.

The United Kingdom officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020, three and a half years
after the referendum of June 23, 2016 which followed an extended and troubled internal Brexit review
process. A formal transition period has now commenced, during which the status quo is expected to be
maintained in the existing trade agreements between both parties, until a new trade deal is agreed by the
parties before the end the negotiations.

The duration of the transition period is uncertain, although the aim is to reach an agreement before
the end of 2020. Considering the scope and the complexity of the trade deals that have to be agreed for all
exchanges of goods and services between the United Kingdom and the EU, this timeframe is ambitious
and may be extended.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(4) Brexit (Continued)**

At the time of writing, the expectation is that the United Kingdom and the European Union intend to
sign a trade deal.

If the negotiation fails and a trade deal is not reached, the risk is that customs duties will be applied
on transactions between the United Kingdom and the European Union, significant fluctuations in the
exchange rate of the Pound against the Euro and the possibility of even stricter regulations being applied.

The Guala Closures Group has closely monitored the Brexit process and has deemed that there are no
significant related risks that could materially affect the group’s assets and liabilities at the reporting date.

The group does not expect that the future financial performance of its operations in the United
Kingdom will be significantly impacted by Brexit due to a local presence with long established customer
relationships and to a market which offers stable real growth in volumes and the possibility of hedging in
order to maintain the assumptions on profit margins envisaged in the budget.

The group has taken the following mitigating factors into account in evaluating the Brexit-related
risks:

   - its consolidated relationships with its customers, which are mainly local companies belonging to
large groups with which the Guala Closures Group has longstanding commercial relationships;

   - a stable market which is resilient to changes in socio-political conditions;

   - the group’s position as market leader of its sector;

  - most of the UK cross-border transactions are with the European Union and a trade deal between
the parties is, at, present, likely;

   - the expectation that the market will absorb any customs duties through consumer prices and that
they are recharged to the added value of the products sold;

   - financial liabilities are mostly in euros and only a small portion is in pounds sterling. There are no
significant non-current financial assets and liabilities in pounds sterling;

   - the group’s local companies that operate in the United Kingdom do not have exposures to banks in
the United Kingdom;

   - the human resources in the United Kingdom are local and there are no significant risks expected in
relation to customs restrictions on the entrance of people into the United Kingdom;

   - no significant contractual risks have been identified.

The group and, especially, Guala Closures UK and Guala Closures UCP are prepared for a hard
Brexit outcome and have introduced new procedures for imports to manage the flow of goods from the EU
and to the United Kingdom.

While there is great uncertainty about future events, based on the above-mentioned internal
assessments and supported by meetings with the customers of the local group companies, the group has
not identified significant factors that would suggest that its production and sales will be greatly affected by
Brexit.

Although it is not currently expected to have a material impact on the group’s operations, the Brexit
process remains uncertain and could give rise to restrictions on imports and exports between the United
Kingdom and the member states of the European Union, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the
pound sterling and the Euro and more stringent regulations which could negatively and significantly
impact the group’s operations and financial performance.

**(5) Operating segments**

Reportable segments are the group’s strategic divisions as determined in accordance with the
quantitative and qualitative requirements of IFRS 8.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(5) Operating segments (Continued)**

The group has only one reportable segment, the Closures division. The group’s CEO (the chief
operating decision maker) reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis. The following
summary describes the operations in this reportable segment.

The Closures division represents the group’s core business. Other operations include the PET division
which did not meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments under IFRS 8
in December 2019.

During the second quarter of 2019, Guala Closures Group launched the reorganisation of the PET
division, the activities of which were only performed by Guala Closures Iberica, up until the acquisition of
the British UCP on December 12, 2018. After acquiring UCP, the group decided to reorganise the division
by transferring part of the assets to a non-group operator in this sector and to concentrate the remaining
ones with the newly acquired Guala Closures UCP. The reorganisation was undertaken to benefit from the
sale of a non-strategic business to a third party and to concentrate production in a single group facility,
thereby generating economies of scale.

As a result of the reorganisation, the division is closely connected to the Closures division as its
customers and those of the Closure division’s Spirit sector are the same and because the PET division’s
activities are substantially an accessory market related to the sale of closures to group customers.

Information regarding the results of the group’s reportable segment is included below. Performance is
measured based on segment revenue, operating profit, amortisation and depreciation, trade receivables,
inventories, trade payables, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and capital expenditure as
included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the CEO and by the board of directors.

Management considers the above information as the most suitable to evaluate the results of the
segment compared to other entities that operate in these industries.

All other asset and liability figures cannot be reported by segment as management believes that the
availability of such information by segment is not relevant.

The 2018 comparative figures included in these consolidated financial statements comprise those of
just Space4 S.p.A. for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018, and those of post-merger Guala
Closures Group for the period from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.

**Information about major customers**

In the Closures segment, at December 31, 2019, there are two customers that generate over 10% of
revenue: the turnover of the first customer amounts to around €87 million for 2019 (roughly 14% of net
revenue), while that of the second customer is approximately €72 million for the same year (roughly 12%
of net revenue).

**(6) Acquisition of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests**

No non-recurring acquisitions of subsidiaries, business units or non-controlling interests took place
during the year.

These consolidated financial statements fully reflect the completion of the procedure to allocate the
purchase prices to the identifiable assets acquired, the identifiable liabilities assumed and the
non-controlling interests acquired by Guala Closures Group as part of the acquisitions of pre-merger
Guala Closures Group and United Closures and Plastics, described in detail in the 2018 Annual Report to
which reference should be made.

**(6.1) Acquisition of pre-merger Guala Closures Group**

**(6.1.1) Introduction**

On July 31, 2018, Space4 S.p.A. acquired 67% of pre-merger Guala Closures, the parent of
pre-merger Guala Closures Group and, on August 6, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. was merged into Space4
S.p.A.. Furthermore, the latter company and its group changed their name to Guala Closures S.p.A. and
Guala Closures Group, respectively.

Specifically, the following took place on the group’s acquisition date:

(a) Space4 purchased 52,316,125 ordinary shares held by the former ultimate parent of the
pre-merger Guala Closures Group, GCL Holdings SCA (“GCL”);

(b) GCL transferred 7,403,229 pre-merger Guala Closures ordinary shares to PII G S.à r.l.;

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(6) Acquisition of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests (Continued)**

(c) GCL transferred 1,480,646 pre-merger Guala Closures ordinary shares to Quaestio Capital SGR
unipersonale S.p.A., as the manager of Quaestio Italian Growth Fund.

Furthermore, GCL transferred:

(a) 2,601,089 ordinary shares to GCL Holdings LP S.à.r.l. (“LP”);

(b) 351,202 ordinary shares to Private Equity Opportunities Fund II SCS-SIF, Compartment B,
(“PEOF”).

As a result of the above transactions, the share capital of pre-merger Guala Closures was comprised
as follows:

  - approximately 67% was held by Space4;

  - approximately 19% was held by GCL;

   - approximately 9% was held by PII G S.à r.l;

  - approximately 1% was held by Quaestio Capital SGR unipersonale S.p.A., on behalf of Quaestio
Italian Growth Fund;

  - approximately 3% was held by LP;

  - approximately 1% was held by PEOF;

On August 6, 2018, Space4 S.p.A. carried out a €17,566,646 capital increase to serve the merger, as a
result of which the shareholders of pre-merger Guala Closures received Space4 shares in exchange as
follows:

Price per pre-merger Guala Closures share (€6.75381)/Price per Space4 share (€10.00).

The transaction, which is in line with Space4 S.p.A.’s business object, generated a positive difference
between the consideration transferred (equal to the consideration transferred by Space4 S.p.A. increased
by the fair value of the shares issued to serve the merger in favour of GCL Holdings SCA, PII G S.a.r.l.,
Quaestio Capital SGR, GCL Holdings LP S.a.r.l. and PEOF) and the fair value of the management
warrants and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests proportionally to the percentage of
investment in Guala Closures’ assets and liabilities and the net assets acquired. Under IFRS 3, if the sum
of the transferred consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed on
the acquisition date, the excess amount shall be allocated to goodwill (for additional information,
reference should be made to the section on “Goodwill”).

**Total consideration transferred to acquire 100% of pre-merger Guala Closures . . .** **(A+B+C) 530,334**

Pre-merger Guala Closures shares were exchanged in the ratio of 0.675381 Space4 shares for every
Guala Closures share based on an independent appraisal. Consequently, the fair value of the residual 33%
of pre-merger Guala Closures shares exchanged with Space4 shares was calculated to be
€174,960 thousand.

On July 30, 2018, pre-merger Guala Closures made a capital increase against consideration which was
fully subscribed and paid-in by GCL for approximately €25 million. These shares carried 1,480,646 GCL
management warrants which were exchanged as part of the merger and, on the date the merger became
effective, 1,000,000 management warrants were issued at the same exchange ratio as the merger.

Therefore, the fair value of the management warrants amounted to €1,334 thousand and was included
in the consideration transferred as part of the business combination.

**(6.1.3) Transaction costs**

The group incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately €11 million related to legal fees and
due diligence costs. These costs have been mainly included in legal/consultancy expenses of the group’s
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

**_Measurement of fair values_**

Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used in measuring the fair values of the main assets
acquired:

**Assets acquired** **Valuation technique**

**Inventories** _Market comparison technique: the fair value of inventories is calculated using the_
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale and a suitable profit
margin based on the efforts required to complete or sell the inventories.

**Plant and** The fair value of plant and machinery is estimated using the “replacement cost”
**machinery** method, whereby:

             - the cost to repurchase the asset is recalculated at current market costs;

             - the residual useful life of each asset is calculated based on an internal technical
analysis carried out by the group’s specialists;

            - a depreciation factor is determined in accordance with the IOWA curve;

             - fair value is taken to be the replacement cost.

For some recently-acquired companies, the carrying amount at the measurement date
was considered in line with the fair value.

**Trademark** The fair value of Guala Closures’ trademark was estimated using the relief from
royalties method, whereby the intangible asset is measured at the present value of the
consideration (royalty flows) to which the owner of the asset would be entitled as a
right to use the asset over a period equal to the estimated residual useful life of the
asset, assuming that it did not own the asset.

The main assumptions applied to the trademark are as follows:

             - Useful life: 20 years

             - Royalty rate: 2% as per the group’s policy and current market practices, net of
the estimated maintenance costs

              - Italy’s tax rate


**Trade**
**relationships**
**with customers**


The fair value of trade relationships with customers was calculated using the multiperiod excess earnings method (MEEM) whereby the income pertaining to the asset is
the difference between total income and the remuneration of other assets (property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets and working capital).

The main assumptions applied to the trade relationships with customers are as follows:

   - Useful life: 25 years

  - Churn rate: 4% calculated as the average between the company’s churn rate
and the churn rate embedded in the average useful life of the trade
relationships with customers shown in the PPA procedures of comparable
companies

   - Tax rate weighted by EBIT generated by the group’s divisions


**Patents** The fair value of patents was estimated using the relief from royalties method,
whereby the intangible asset is measured at the present value of the consideration
(royalty flows) to which the owner of the asset would be entitled as a right to use the
asset over a period equal to the estimated residual useful life of the asset, assuming
that it did not own the asset.

The main assumptions applied to patents are as follows:

             - Specific useful life as per each patent registration document

             - Royalty rate: 4% as per the group’s policy and current market practices, net of
the estimated maintenance costs

             - Specific tax rate of the country of registration

“Non-current financial liabilities” include the financial liabilities to non-controlling investors related
to the right to exercise the put option if certain conditions are met. This amount was not included in the
calculation of the net assets acquired and net liabilities assumed as it related to the existing liability for the
acquisition of non-controlling interests under the “present access method”. It was recognised under
non-current financial liabilities with a balancing entry in equity when calculating the goodwill arising from
the acquisition.

The latter goodwill mainly related to the technical skills and knowledge of Guala Closures’ personnel.

The recognised goodwill will not be deductible for income tax purposes.

**(6) Acquisition of subsidiaries, business units and non-controlling interests (Continued)**

The comparative figures at December 31, 2018 were restated to reflect the effects of the completion
of the PPA procedure related to this business combinations occurred at July 31, 2018. The main captions
of statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income affected by the restatement are:
depreciation and amortisation increase of €7.2 million, financial expenses increase of €1.8 million, income
tax decrease of €1.9 million, negative foreign currency translation differences for foreign operation
decrease of €3.0 million. The main captions of statement of financial position affected by the restatement
are: property, plant and equipment increase of €33.9 million, intangible asset increase of €77.4 million,
deferred tax assets increase of €0.6 million, current financial liabilities increase of €6.1 million, deferred tax

**(6.2) Acquisition of United Closures and Plastics**

On December 12, 2018, through the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l., the group
completed the acquisition of United Closures and Plastics (“UCP”), a Scottish company with registered
office in Bridge of Allan with a long-standing presence in the Scottish market, which supplies some
landmark scotch whisky brands, with which it has forged well-established relationships.

This transaction enabled the Guala Closures Group to expand its footprint in the Scottish market,
enhancing sales activities and its innovation and production processes. Indeed, the group will be able to
consolidate its collaboration with the spirits multinationals in Scotland, particularly those of whisky, one of
the most important segments in the spirits market. The transaction will also boost the industrial
reorganisation process launched by the group in 2018 in the pursuit of greater production efficiency.

the UCP and the consideration transferred. This gain derives from the subjective conditions of negotiation
of the acquisition of the business and its non “strategic” nature for the seller.

Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used in measuring the fair values of the main assets
acquired:

**Assets acquired** **Valuation technique**

**Property** The fair value of property was calculated based on the valuation carried out by an
independent expert at June 12, 2018.

The fair value was calculated assuming that the industrial use remains unchanged.

**Plant and** The fair value of plant and machinery is estimated using the “replacement cost”
**machinery** method, whereby:

             - the cost to repurchase the asset is recalculated at current market costs;

             - the residual useful life of each asset is calculated based on an internal technical
analysis carried out by the group’s specialists;

            - a depreciation factor is determined in accordance with the IOWA curve;

             - fair value is taken to be the replacement cost.

For some recently-acquired companies, the carrying amount at the measurement date
was considered in line with the fair value.

**STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME**

Further to the acquisition of pre-merger Guala Closures Group completed by Space4 S.p.A. on
July 31, 2018, the 2018 comparative figures included in these consolidated financial statements comprise
those of just Space4 S.p.A. for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018 and post-merger Guala
Closures Group (i.e., consolidation scope including Space4 S.p.A. and pre-merger Guala Closures Group)

Market warrants are listed instruments which are recognised under current financial liabilities. The
financial income related to their fair value refers to the change in the official price of these instruments set
by Borsa Italiana during the reporting period. A decrease in the official price generates financial income
(as in 2018 and 2019) since it results in the reduction of the underlying financial liability. Conversely, an
upturn in the official price generates expense, since it results in the increase of the underlying financial
liability.

Financial expense on financial liabilities to non-controlling investors refer to the recognition of the
increase in the financial liabilities for these investors’ right to exercise a put option if certain conditions are
met. The liability was determined by discounting the estimated value of the put option at its expected time
of exercise.

Non-recurring financial expense related to the refinancing, amounting to €8.0 million in 2018, refers
to the write-off of the unamortised transaction costs due to the pre-merger Guala Closures Group’s
refinancing on August 1, 2018 (early redemption of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due in 2021
and the previous Senior Revolving Facility due in 2021).

**(17) Income taxes (Continued)**

**Reconciliation between the theoretical and effective tax charge**

The difference between the theoretical and effective tax charge is mainly related to the impact of the
different tax rates in foreign countries, tax-exempt revenue, non-deductible costs and the use of prior year

**STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION**

**(20) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents rose to €57,056 thousand at December 31, 2019 (€47,795 thousand at
December 31, 2018). The increase is mainly due to the improvement in cash flows from operating activities
in 2019.

**(21) Trade receivables**

The balance of trade receivables reflects the positive impact of various group companies’ use of
reverse without-recourse factoring. This impact at December 31, 2019 was €28.2 million, compared to
€28.5 million December 31, 2018.

(*) The comparative figures at December 31, 2018 were restated to reflect the effects of the business combinations of Guala

**(23) Property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

Finally, in Europe, capital expenditure went to new product development and increasing the
production capacity of the group’s facilities in Spain and Bulgaria; capital expenditure continues at the
Luxembourg research centre for the development of new products and in streamlining and increasing
production capacity.

In Asia, substantial capital expenditure was undertaken at the group’s Indian facilities, particularly in
relation to the expansion of the Dharwad production facility during the year.

In the LATAM-USA area, capital expenditure mainly focussed on the group’s Mexican facility with
projects to cut production costs and increase production capacity; smaller capital expenditure was also
made in all the other facilities in the area.

In Africa, most capital expenditure was directed at Guala Closures East Africa’s Kenyan facility,
where production began in February 2019.

In Oceania and, specifically, in Australia and New Zealand, only small investments of immaterial
amounts were made for maintenance.

The impairment losses of the year were recognised in connection with the reorganisation of the
subsidiaries Guala Closures France and Beijing Guala Closures.

The historical cost of property, plant and equipment was restated following the above-mentioned PPA
procedure. Plant and machinery reflect the fair value calculated at cost, as described in note 6.1.4.

As a result of the application of IFRS 16, the group reclassified finance leases recognised under IAS
17 in the 2018 consolidated financial statements (€12.2 million) to “Right-of-use assets” at January 1, 2019.

Property, plant and equipment include the cost of internal work capitalised.

Disposals mainly relate to the sale of the PET sector assets owned by Guala Closures Iberica (Spain).
During the year, these assets were transferred to third parties following the sector reorganisation as
discussed in the paragraph on operating segments.

None of the group’s property, plant and equipment has been pledged as collateral at year end, except
for the items indicated in note 36) Commitments and guarantees.

(*) The comparative figures at December 31, 2018 were restated to reflect the effects of the business combinations of Guala
Closures Group and UCP which took place on July 31, 2018 and December 12, 2018, respectively.

The historical cost of intangible assets was restated following the above-mentioned PPA procedure.
As described in note 6.1.4, Licences and patents reflect the fair value of the Guala Closures trademark and
patents, calculated using the relief from royalty method. Other mainly reflects the fair value of the trade
relationships with customers, calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method, while the fair value
of the other items comprising this caption was deemed equal to the carrying amount at the date of the
business combination.

The goodwill recognised at the end of the PPA procedure was measured as the excess amount of the
sum of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests and the net carrying
amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Additional details are
provided in section 6.1.5.

**(25) Intangible assets (Continued)**

As described in note (2) Accounting policies, goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment.
The group checks the recoverability of goodwill at least once a year, or more frequently if specific events or
circumstances indicate impairment, by testing each CGU (cash-generating unit).

Goodwill is allocated entirely on Closures division and it is tested at consolidated level. Indeed:

   - the investment strategy is unique and integrated at group level, pursued on the basis of the central
development of cost/benefit analyses that maximise the return on investment for the entire Guala
Closures Group, while taking into account the performance objectives of the individual legal
entities;

   - by virtue of the centralised strategy described above, the investments of the individual legal entities
are subject to the group approval in accordance with its strategy;

   - strategic guidance and coordination activities are carried out centrally by a single management
team;

   - consistency with the representation of the group’s financial results provided to the market is
ensured. In particular, the results and the KPIs are disclosed at consolidated level, while for the
individual legal entities only the figures relating to revenues are shown.

The CGU identified by the group to monitor goodwill coincides with the level of aggregation of
operations set out in IFRS 8—Operating Segments which, for the group, is the Closures division.

Goodwill allocated to the Closures CGU was successfully tested for impairment at the reporting date.
Consequently, no impairment loss was recognised on goodwill at December 31, 2019.

The recoverability of the recognised amounts is tested by comparing the net invested capital (carrying
amount) of the CGU with the related recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of goodwill is equal to
value in use, i.e., the present value of the operating cash flows which arise from the forecasts included in
the long-term plans approved by the group, and the normalised terminal value, used to express a summary
estimate of future figures over the explicit given timeframe . These cash flows are subsequently discounted
using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the group asset or CGU.

The discounted cash flow model is based on the cash flow projections for five years based on the
business plan approved by the board of directors on March 9, 2020 which envisages a CAGR of net
revenue and EBITDA of 4% and 6%, respectively. The terminal growth rate was determined based on
management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the
assumption that a market participant would make. Such growth rate is consistent with the expected
inflation rate for the countries in which the Group operates weighted for revenue by geographical area.

In the 2019 valuation, the following assumptions were used:

  - the WACC for the Closures division was weighted by the 2019 net revenue percentage of each
destination market country in respect of the 2019 consolidated revenues, with a weighted average of
8.4%;

   - long-term growth rate “g”: a value equal to 2.7% was used, calculated by weighting the expected
inflation rate for net revenue percentage of each destination market country in respect of the 2019
consolidated revenues, in line with the calculation for the terminal value.

The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the past history and the industry average
weighted-average cost of capital, with a possible debt leveraging of 40% at a market interest rate of 2.8%.

The division’s estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by over €55 million.

The estimates and plan figures to which the above parameters are applied are calculated by
management based on past experience and the expected developments of the markets in which the group
operates at the date of this consolidated financial statements. To this end, the current international macroeconomic situation and the possible financial impacts, the current context of contraction following the

**(25) Intangible assets (Continued)**

health emergency, may result in uncertain scenarios in terms of achieving the objectives and levels of
activity set out in the plan without, however, causing the impairment of recognised goodwill. However, the
estimate of goodwill’s recoverable amount requires management’s discretion and the latter’s use of
estimates, and although part of the forecast net revenue and gross operating profit of the Closures CGU
may be delayed from one year to the following year, while nonetheless achieving the total growth expected
by the plan, it cannot be excluded that goodwill will be impaired in the future due to presentlyunforeseeable changes in the scenario.

The circumstances and events which may result in an additional impairment test are constantly
monitored by the group’s management.

Based on the above, management carried out a sensitivity analysis of changes in the WACC and ‘g’
rates. Specifically, the values of WACC and ‘g’ rate that individually would result in the CGU recoverably
value equal to the carrying amount as at 31 December 2019 are respectively equal to 8.6% and 2.4%.

Goodwill has never been impaired.

(*) The comparative figures at December 31, 2018 were restated to reflect the effects of the business combinations of Guala
Closures Group and UCP which took place on July 31, 2018 and December 12, 2018, respectively.

Deferred tax liabilities mainly relate to the business combination of Guala Closures Group which took
place on July 31, 2018. Smaller deferred tax liabilities also refer to the business combination of UCP on
December 12, 2018.

Specifically, deferred tax liabilities were recognised on the revaluation of the group’s assets as part of
the PPA procedure following their recognition at fair value. Indeed, these revaluations are neutral for tax
purposes.

The higher deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of the business combination of Guala Closures
Group is recognised on the revaluation of the following assets:

   - intangible assets and, specifically, Trade relationships with customers, Guala Closures trademark
and Patents;

   - property, plant and equipment and, specifically, plant and equipment

During the year, the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. recognised deferred tax assets of €7.9 million based
on the most recent estimates of the taxable income for the 2020-2024 five-year plan, which allows the
offsetting of prior year tax losses.

The changes of the year reflect the adjustment of deferred tax liabilities to the new tax rate in India
and Italy.

They may be analysed as follows:

   - €4.0 million was released in respect of the deferred tax liabilities recognised on the gains on the
group’s PPA procedure allocated to Guala Closures India following the new tax rate approved by
the Indian government in September and applicable retrospectively from April 1, 2019.
Consequently, the new rate was essentially decreased from 35% to 25% of the taxable income;

   - the -€2.0 million adjustment of Guala Closures S.p.A.’s deferred taxes due to the new IRAP rate
(5.57% compared to 3.90%) applicable in the years in which the temporary differences on which the
deferred taxation is recognised will be reversed, as a result of Guala Closures S.p.A. becoming an
“industrial holding company” and the related tax scheme that will be applicable from the date of
approval of the 2019 financial statements.

The tax losses that can be carried forward at year end total €180,986 thousand. They may be used in
accordance with the legislation of the different countries in which the companies to which they relate are
based.

**(26) Deferred tax assets and liabilities (Continued)**

The tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely amount to €168,522 thousand and refer to
Guala Closures S.p.A., Guala Closures Chile S.p.A., Guala Closures France SAS, Guala Closures North
America Inc. and Guala Closures UCP Ltd.

Based on the most recent estimates of future taxable income, the Group has recognized deferred tax
assets on tax losses carried forward for € 10,319 thousand corresponding to the value of € 41,708 thousand
equal to the estimate of future taxable income that is considered probable based on the planning Group
tax.

The value of tax losses carried forward that are not included in the deferred tax assets recognized in
the statement of financial position of the Group at December 31, 2019 are therefore equal to
€ 139,279 thousand, corresponding to potential deferred tax assets of €33,438 thousand if recognized
(including €31,451 relating to tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely).

**(27) Current and non-current financial liabilities**

This section provides information on the contractual terms governing the group’s bank overdrafts,
loans and bonds.

Reference should be made to note 35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for
further information on the group’s exposure to interest and currency risks.

Furthermore, on July 20, 2018, the parent entered into a revolving credit facility governed by the laws
of England and Wales with UniCredit Bank AG, Milan Branch, as agent, and the original lenders (Credit
Suisse International, Banco BPM S.p.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and Unicredit S.p.A.)
for a maximum amount of €80 million (the “New RCF”) at the 3M Euribor/GBP LIBOR + 2.5% (zero
floor). The New RCF will expire on February 28, 2024.

On October 3, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. issued floating rate bonds of €445 million (3M Euribor +
3.5%—zero floor) due in 2024 (the “Bonds”) under an indenture contract governed by the laws of the
State of New York. The contract was signed, inter alia, by Guala Closures S.p.A., as the issuer, The Law
Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c., as the senior secured notes trustee and Bondholders’ representative
pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, Deutsche Bank AG, London branch, as the
paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as the transfer agent and the registrar (the
“Indenture”).

The parent has, inter alia, a covenant on the New RCF. Failure to comply with it may require the
parent to repay the facility earlier, should the New RCF be drawn by more than 40% of its total amount
(€80 million). Under this covenant, the ratio of the parent’s indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, both
calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions of the New RCF, shall not exceed 6.40x.

Under this agreement, the parent’s Treasury department is required to constantly monitor the
covenant and to regularly report to management and the lending bank in order to ensure compliance. At
December 31, 2019, the facility has not been used for more than 40%, which is the triggering condition for
the application of the covenant. In any case, the covenant is complied with.

Other financial liabilities include the fair value of the market warrants at December 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2018 (€3,873 thousand and €4,338 thousand, respectively). The difference between the fair
value at December 31, 2019 and that at December 31, 2018 was recognised in the statement of profit or
loss and comprehensive income for the year, under financial expense (€465 thousand). The impact on the
statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income for the year is attributable to the increase in the
market price of the market warrants, which went from €0.224 at December 31, 2018 to €0.20 at
December 31, 2019.

On the date of their first trading, the parent recognised 10,000,000 market warrants, traded separately
to the shares, for an amount of €6,000,000, by setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount
(described in note 32) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent). Furthermore, on August 6, 2018,
the date the merger became effective, another 9,367,393 market warrants were assigned for €9,367,393,
setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount. The warrants were assigned free of charge in the
ratio of four market warrants to every 10 ordinary shares. They can be exercised against payment as

resolved by the shareholders in their extraordinary meetings of September 26, 2017 and November 16,
2017.

Based on the market warrant regulation, the warrant holders may decide to exercise them in whole or
in part at any time and to subscribe the exchange shares at the subscription price, as long as the average
monthly price is higher than the strike price (€10 per share). The subscription price of €0.10 per exchange
share was approved by the shareholders on September 26, 2017 based on the amendments introduced on
October 26, 2017. The parent will publish the acceleration communication should the average monthly
price be the same as or higher than €13 per share.

As a result, the holders of the market warrants will be assigned exchange shares based on the
following exchange ratio:

_Average monthly price - Strike price_

_Average monthly price - Subscription price_

Warrants not exercised by the expiry date are taken to have been extinguished and are no longer valid
when by expiry date is meant the first of the following dates: (i) the first trading date after five years from
the relevant transaction’s effective date and (ii) the first trading date after 60 calendar days from the date
of publication of the acceleration communication.

Financial liabilities to non-controlling investors relate to recognition of these investors’ right to
exercise a put option if certain conditions are met. It represents the discounted estimated value of the put
option at its expected time of exercise.

This caption has been recognised using the present access method, whereby the financial liability was
recognised as a reduction in equity in the first year. The fluctuation in each year, if any, is recognised
under financial income (expense) in profit or loss and the non-controlling interests continue to be
presented separately as, to all effects, the non-controlling investors have the right to access the profit or
loss pertaining to their investment. Following the PPA procedure, the financial liability was adjusted to
reflect the allocation of the resulting gains attributable to non-controlling investors.

Reference should be made to note 35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for
further details.

**Total current provisions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,789** **1,980**

The provision for restructuring includes:

  - €376 thousand for the downsizing of Guala Closures UK Ltd’s production activities, commenced in
2018, which entails the transfer of plant and machinery from the secondary Broomhill facility to the
main facility in Kirkintilloch. The provision has been calculated considering the cost of terminating
the existing agreements and the benefits due to employees under the related contracts. The
provision is unchanged since the production site has not yet been definitively discontinued.

  - €288 thousand for the reorganisation of Guala Closures France, commenced in March 2019 and
entailing investments at the Chambray facility for the production of small batches of closures for
the wine sector with very short lead times to meet market requirements. As a result of this
investment in the Chambray facility, assets (machinery and part of the workforce) will be
transferred from the Saint Remy Sur Avre facility, which will be shut down. Part of the assets will go
to the Chambray facility and part will go to other group companies. The Saint Remy Sur Avre
facility was originally scheduled to close at the end of July, but this was postponed by about one year
to meet the requirements of customers and distributors that are unable to independently support
the taxation of closures. Therefore, limited operations continue at the facility with approximately
11 employees. The initial accrual of €707 thousand decreased to the current €288 thousand
following the use of the provision for payments made.

**(29) Provisions (Continued)**

   - €13 thousand for the reorganisation of the PET division, the activities of which were only
performed by Guala Closures Iberica, up until the acquisition of the British UCP on December 12,
2018. After acquiring UCP, the group decided to reorganise the division by transferring part of the
activities carried out by Guala Closures Iberica to a non-group sector operator and to assign the
remaining ones to Guala Closures UCP. Following the reorganisation, at the end of July, the Guala
Closures Iberica’s PET facility in Alcalà De Henares (Madrid) was definitively closed, terminating
the contracts with the employees working at the facility. The initial accrual of €1,630 thousand
decreased to the current €13 thousand following the use of the provision for payments made.

The provision for returns reflects the calculation for customer claims received based on the
negotiations in place at the reporting date. The increase on the previous year is entirely due to the rise in
provision for returns of the parent, Guala Closures S.p.A., due to one-off qualitative issues it encountered
during the year.

At December 31, 2019, the provision for contingencies and the other provisions are entirely related to
the evaluations carried out during Guala Closures UCP’s PPA procedure whereby the estimated liabilities
acquired as part of the business combination (€282 thousand) were allocated to these provisions. These
liabilities mainly relate to disputes with third parties and charges for safety measures.

**GCL Pharma tax assessment**

On October 10, 2019, following the tax assessment that began on July 30, 2019, the Finance Police of
Chieti served a preliminary tax assessment report against the Italian group company GCL Pharma S.r.l.,
assessing taxes on allegedly non-deductible costs for a total of €974 thousand in the period from April 1,
2014 to July 29, 2019. All of the costs reinstated in the tax base were for services which the parent Guala
Closures S.p.A. provided to the subsidiary and recharged under an agreement signed on September 15,
2014. The tax inspectors based their findings on a lack of documentation providing evidence that the
parent effectively performed the services. At the date of this report, Guala Closures Group management is
preparing a brief to send to the local tax authorities responsible for issuing the definitive tax assessment
report, in the belief that they can document that the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. effectively performed
the services for the subsidiary GCL Pharma S.r.l., therefore has not been recognized any provision in
connection to this tax assessment, considering that GCL Pharma S.r.l. participates in the national tax
consolidation scheme pursuant to articles 117-128 of Presidential decree no. 917 of December 22, 1986
with the parent Guala Closures S.p.A..

The accrual and a significant part of the utilisations mainly relate to the provision for corporate
reorganisation and, specifically, of the PET division launched by Guala Closures Iberica and of Guala
Closures France’s reorganisation project as described earlier.

The provision for contingencies was used to settle a tax issue covering 2015 and 2016.

At December 31, 2018, the provision for contingencies related to pre-merger Guala Closures’ tax
issues for 2015 and 2016. While Guala Closures S.p.A. (the result of the reverse merger of GCL Special
Closures S.r.l. into Guala Closures S.p.A. in 2012) deemed that it acted in compliance with the regulations
ruling in those years, it decided to enter into a settlement agreement with the tax authorities to settle a

The liability for post-employment benefits (“TFR”—Trattamento di fine rapporto) primarily relates
to Italian companies (Guala Closures S.p.A. mainly) for employee departures, determined using actuarial
techniques and regulated by article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code. The benefit is paid when the employee
leaves the company as a lump sum, the amount of which corresponds to the total benefits accrued during
the employees’ service period based on payroll costs as revalued until their departure. Following the
pension reform, from January 1, 2007, accruing benefits have been transferred to a pension fund or a
treasury fund held by Italy’s social security institution (INPS). Companies with less than 50 employees, can
continue the scheme as in previous years. Therefore, contributions of future TFR to pension funds or the
INPS treasury fund entails that these amounts will be treated as a defined contribution plan. Amounts
vested before January 1, 2007 continue to be accounted for as defined benefits to be assessed based on
actuarial assumptions.

Changes in post-employment benefits and the main assumptions used in their measurement are
detailed below:

value of Iboxx indexes AA corporate bonds observed at December 31, 2019, as per the requirements of
IAS 19.

The group expects to pay around €0.4 million of benefits to its defined benefit plan in 2020.

**Sensitivity analysis:**

Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions,
assuming the other variables do not change, would have affected Guala Closures S.p.A.’s post-employment
benefits at December 31, 2019 by the amounts shown below:

**Defined benefit**
**obligation**
**(€’000)** **Increase** **Decrease**

Turnover rate (1% variation) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (26) 29

Discount rate (0.25% variation) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (70) 72

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the
plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

Guala Closures UK has a defined benefit pension plan under which the employees of the former
Metalclosures Ltd have the right to a pension. This plan has a surplus at December 31, 2019 (i.e., the fair
value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation). As required by
IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus that can be recognised must be less than the benefits available in the
form of reimbursements or the contribution holiday: following completion of the West Bromwich site
restructuring plan in 2008, the amount of the contribution holiday is zero and, therefore, the English
company has not recognised the fund surplus. In addition, the group did not have contingent liabilities at
the reporting date as the fund covers the present value of its future obligations with its plan assets.

For disclosure purposes, the amounts of the fund obligations and plan assets, as well as the baseline
actuarial parameters used for their calculation, are shown below:

**(32) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent**

At December 31, 2019, Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares whose ordinary shares
and market warrants have been traded on the Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato Telematico Azioniario)
organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., within the Star Segment, since August 6, 2018.

Guala Closures S.p.A. has subscribed and paid-in share capital of €68,907 thousand, consisting of
67,184,904 shares, of which 62,049,966 ordinary shares, 4,322,438 class B multiple-vote shares (Class B
special shares entitle the holders to three votes per share and upon any transfer of the Class B special
shares to a third-party, the Class B special shares voting rights will be reduced from three votes per share
to one vote per share) and 812,500 class C shares with no voting rights. Similarly, 19,367,393 market
warrants, 2,500,000 sponsor warrants and 1,000,000 management warrants are outstanding.

The special shares Class C to which, upon issue, 2,500,000 sponsor warrants have been attached, have
the same rights as the ordinary shares, with the sole exception of the following:

   - they do not have voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings;

   - they do not have the right to dividends approved as ordinary dividends;

   - they cannot be transferred until the last day of the twelfth month after the Relevant Transaction
and, should the Relevant Transaction not take place, for the maximum duration of the company as
established by article 4 of the by-laws except for (i) those transferred to the withdrawing
shareholders of Space Holding after the liquidation procedure as payment in kind for the sale of
their investment; and (ii) those transferred to the beneficiary of a proportionate demerger of Space
Holding S.r.l.;

   - if the Company is dissolved, they give the right to their voters to be paid their stake of liquidation
equity after the ordinary shareholders;

   - they give the right to receive two sponsor warrants for every special share issued;

   - when certain conditions are met, the special shares are automatically converted into ordinary
shares, at the ratio of 4.5 ordinary shares for each special share, without the need for their holders
to express their intention to convert and without any change to be made to the amount of share
capital, provided that the conversion will decrease the implicit carrying amount of ordinary shares.

The sponsor warrants attached to the special shares and assigned free of charge in the ratio of two
warrants for every special share subscribed are not traded on the Italian regulated stock market or abroad.

Each sponsor warrant gives its holder the right to subscribe an exchange share if the share’s official
price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, which is the period
between the first trading date after the Relevant Transaction’s effective date and the tenth anniversary of
this date.

**(32) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent (Continued)**

Furthermore, on 6 August 2018, 1,000,000 Management Warrants were issued. They can be exercised
as of this date and will entitle holders to one Management Warrant share for every exchangeable
management warrant, provided that the post-merger Guala Closures share’s official price is equal to or
higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, and against payment of a subscription price
per share of Euro 13.

Warrants that have not been exercised at the end of this period irrevocably become ineffective and are
taken to have been extinguished as explained in the related regulations to which reference is made.

At December 31, 2019, equity comprises unavailable reserves for market warrants of
€19,367 thousand, of which €6,000 thousand was recognised as a decrease in the share premium reserve
following the capital increase which took place on December 21, 2017 and the concurrent allocation of
10,000 thousand market warrants, and €9,367 thousand was taken as a reduction of other reserves,
following the allocation of the residual 9,367,393 market warrants upon listing and the concurrent merger
on August 6, 2018.

The group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the
group’s future and to support its development.

The group thus seeks to maintain a sufficient level of capitalisation, while giving shareholders
satisfactory returns and ensuring the group has access to external sources of financing at acceptable terms,
including by maintaining an adequate rating.

The group monitors the debt/equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net
indebtedness and cash flows generated by operating activities.

The board of directors carefully monitors the balance between greater returns through the right level
of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position.

To achieve these objectives, the group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable.

The board of directors monitors the return on capital, being total equity attributable to owners of the
parent, excluding non-controlling interests, and the amount of dividends to be distributed to holders of
ordinary shares.

On the basis of available information published by Consob (the Italian Commission for listed
companies and the stock exchange), updated to December 31, 2019, the parent’s main shareholders are as
follows:

  - GCL Holdings S.C.A. holding 24.276% of the voting shares;

   - PII G S.à r.l. holding 8.816% of the voting shares;

   - GCL Holdings LP S.à r.l. holding 5.634% of the voting shares.

**Repurchase of own shares**

On February 14, 2019, during their ordinary meeting, the shareholders of Guala Closures S.p.A.
resolved to:

1. authorise the board of directors, pursuant to article 2357 and following articles of the Italian Civil
Code and article 132 of the Consolidated Finance Act, to repurchase the parent’s ordinary shares
(therefore excluding special B and special C shares), for the purposes set out by the directors in
their report, up to the maximum amount which, considering the ordinary Guala Closures shares
held from time to time by the parent, must not exceed a total of 3% of the ordinary shares
outstanding on the date of the shareholders’ meeting (equal to approximately 1,861,500 ordinary
shares), to be carried out, including in more than one tranche, within 18 months of the date of the
shareholders’ resolution and in the manner described below:

i. the purchase price shall not be above or below 10% of the reference price on the Italian Stock
Exchange (Mercato Telematico Azioniario), organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.
(“MTA”) in the session prior to each individual transaction. Furthermore, in any case, the

**(32) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent (Continued)**

treasury shares will be repurchased in accordance with the additional operating limits set by
EU and national legislation, including regulations, ruling from time to time and applicable to
purchases;

ii. the purchases shall be made in compliance with article 132 of the Consolidated Finance Act,
article 144-bis.1.b) of the Issuer Regulation and any other applicable legislation, including the
market practices accepted and recognised by Consob;

2. authorise, pursuant to article 2357-ter of the Italian Civil Code, the repurchase, including in more
than one tranche and without time limits, of ordinary Guala Closures S.p.A. shares in accordance
with the above resolution, as follows:

i. if carried out in cash, at a price not below 10% of the reference price on the MTA in the
session prior to each transaction;

ii. if carried out as part of extraordinary transactions, including, but not limited to, exchange,
swap, contribution or any other non-cash disposal, in accordance with the financial terms set by
the board of directors, based on the nature and the characteristics of the transaction, also
considering the performance of the parent’s share;

iii. with respect to the ordinary shares serving stock option plans, in accordance with the terms and
conditions set out in the relevant plan regulations;

iv. with respect to the activities falling under the so-called ‘accepted market practice’ covered by
article 180.1.c) of the Consolidated Finance Act about operations to support market liquidity,
in accordance with the criteria set by Consob from time to time and, in any case, in compliance
with any terms, conditions and requirements set by EU and national legislation (including
regulations) applicable from time to time, to grant the board of directors and/or through its
chairperson and the CEO, Marco Giovannini, and the director, Anibal Diaz Diaz, the widest
powers, including the power of sub-delegation or to engage external experts, to be exercised
also separately and with the widest discretion, in order to implement the Programme and the
relevant purchases and sales, however in full compliance with ruling legislation and the
limitations of your authorisation as resolved above.

No repurchases had taken place at the reporting date.

**(35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

**(b) Measurement of fair values**

**(i) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs**

The market warrants are measured at fair value through profit or loss and classified under other
financial liabilities. Fair value is calculated based on the market price at year end, considering the price of
the STAR segment of the stock exchange, ISIN: IT0005311813.

Therefore, the following changes in fair value could significantly affect the parent’s performance:

   - a rise in the market warrants’ fair values could lead to an increase in the parent’s liabilities and
financial expense;

   - a reduction in the market warrants’ fair values could lead to a decrease in the parent’s liabilities and
an increase in financial income.

These financial income and expense are accounting changes that do not lead to cash inflows or
outflows.

The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 and Level 3 fair values,
as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.

**Financial instruments measured at fair value**


**Inter-relationship between**
**significant unobservable**
**inputs and fair value**
**measurement**

The estimated fair value
would increase if:

- the EBITDA was
higher

- the discount rate of
the country decreased

- the expected dividend
yield decreased

- the inflation rate
differential between
Ukraine, Poland,
Bulgaria and the USA
increases the discount
rate adjusted by the
group’s lower credit
risk

- the expected exercise
date for the put
option was earlier


**Type** **Valuation technique**


Put option on
non-controlling
interests

Forward interest rate
swaps, currency
forwards and
aluminium derivatives


Discounted cash flows:
The fair value is
determined considering
the expected payment,
capitalised at the
reporting date, net of the
expected dividend yields,
discounted to present
value using a credit riskadjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is
calculated considering
the fair value of the
subsidiary or its equity
based on the relevant
contractual agreements
with non-controlling
investors.

Market comparison
technique:
The fair values are based
on broker quotes. Similar
contracts are traded in
an active market and the
quotes reflect the actual
transactions of similar
instruments.


**Significant unobservable**
**inputs**

- expected cash flows in
the 2020-2024 plan
(€49 million);

- inflation data about
Ukraine, Bulgaria,
Poland and the USA,
used to calculate riskfree rates (1.5%-3%)

- discount rate specific
to the country in
which the subsidiary
operates, adjusted by
the group’s credit risk
(9%-15%,)

- expected date of put
option exercise (67-74
age of retire) based
on demographic
assumptions


Not applicable. Not applicable.

**(35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

Even though secured bond issues are quoted on the OTC market like the Euro-MTF in Luxembourg,
no relevant transactions were recorded during the year and so such financial instrument was classified as

**(c) Financial risk management**

The group is exposed to the following risks as a result of its operations:

   - credit risk;

   - liquidity risk;

   - interest rate risk;

   - currency risk;

   - other price risk.

Guala Closures S.p.A.’s board of directors has overall responsibility for establishing and monitoring a
risk management system for the group.

The proxy system ensures the risk management guidelines are implemented and regularly monitored.

**(35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

The finance department is responsible for the monitoring and, in carrying out such activities, it uses
information generated by the internal control system.

_Credit risk_

This is the risk that a customer or the counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to meet an
obligation, leading to a financial loss. These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables and financial
investments.

The group’s exposure to credit risk depends largely on each customer’s specific characteristics. The
demographics of the group’s customer portfolio, including the segment insolvency risk and the country
risk, have an impact on the credit risk.

The group accrues an allowance for impairment equal to the estimated losses on trade and other loans
and receivables. It comprises both the recognition of impairment losses for material individual amounts
and the recognition of collective impairment for similar groups of assets to cover losses already incurred
but not yet identified. The collective impairment losses are calculated on the basis of historical payment
statistics.

Most of the group’s trade receivables are due from leading operators of the alcoholic and
non-alcoholic beverage segment. Most of its trading relationships are with longstanding customers.

The Group reduces credit exposure by using supplier financing lines made available by the Group’s
main customers, leading to factors part of its trade receivables without recourse.

The group’s historical figures indicate a modest amount of credit losses. The risk is fully covered by
the corresponding loss allowance recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

There are no cases of particularly concentrated credit risk in geographical terms.

At December 31, 2018 and 2019, trade receivables may be analysed by geographical segment as
follows:

**(€’000)** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2019**

The group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 90 days are still
collectible, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analyses of the underlying customers’
credit ratings. Based on historical default rates, the group believes that, apart from the above, no loss
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not yet due or past due by up to 90 days.

_Liquidity risk_

This risk regards the group’s ability to meet its obligations arising from financial liabilities.

The group’s approach to liquidity management is to ensure adequate funds are always available to
cover its obligations at the expiry dates, both in normal conditions and at times of financial difficulty,
without incurring borrowing expense at terms higher than market conditions.

The group generally ensures there is enough cash and cash equivalents to cover forecast short-term
operating expenses, including those related to financial liabilities. Contingent effects arising from extreme
situations that cannot reasonably be forecast, such as natural disasters, are excluded from the above.

The aim of Guala Closures Group’s financing strategy is to maintain a well-balanced maturity profile
for liabilities to thereby reduce the refinancing risk. Historically, the group has always met its obligations
on time and has been able to re-finance indebtedness before its expiry.

At the reporting date, the group has the loans, credit lines and facilities shown in the tables in note 27)
Current and non-current financial liabilities to which reference should be made for additional information.

The interest payments on variable interest rate loans and bond issues in the table above and included
in contractual cash flows reflect market forward interest rates at the reporting date and these amounts may
change as market interest rates change. The future cash flows on the put options on non-controlling
interests and derivative instruments may be different from the amount in the above table as interest rates
and exchange rates or the relevant conditions underlying the contingency change. Except for these
financial liabilities, it is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis will materialise
significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.

_Interest rate risk_

This risk relates to volatility of the market rates which determine the interest expense paid on
outstanding loans.

The group is exposed to interest rate risk as almost the full amount of its financial liabilities is subject
to the payment of interest at floating rates subject to short-term repricing.

The group’s policy is to hedge a small portion of the liability subject to interest rate risk due to the
current low interest rates.

The group does not currently deem it necessary to hedge the portion of the liability subject to interest
rate risk given the current Euribor parameters.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The fair value of financial liabilities was calculated by an external actuary using the following
methodology:

   - the cash flows generated by the outstanding liabilities are identified both in terms of interest and
principal. These cash flows are calculated with reference to the interest rates and the related
repayment plan;

F-208


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**at December 31, 2019**

**(35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

   - the individual cash flows are discounted using risk-free rates ruling on the measurement date. These
rates are deducted from the swap rates using the bootstrap method for each expiry date of the
corresponding cash flow based on the resulting time curve;

   - furthermore the individual cash flows are discounted using an additional rate, based on the group’s
credit standing, calculated as the weighted average of the spreads applied to the different financing
agreements. The spreads applied to the financing agreements are deemed to objectively represent
the group’s credit standing and subsequent significant changes should not arise given its current
financial position.

The following table shows the sensitivity analysis for the cash flows from these financial liabilities and
the related hedging derivatives at December 31, 2019:

**(€’000)** **Increase of 100bp** **Decrease of 100bp**

**Sensitivity of cash flows of other financial liabilities (net) . . . . . . . . . . .** **(3)** **3**

The following methodology is used to perform the sensitivity analyses: a change is assumed in the
interest rate used to calculate the interest (+/- 100 basis points), which indicates the change in the overall
liability. Accordingly, negative amounts indicate an increase in the fair value of the liability and vice versa
for positive amounts.

_Currency risk_

This risk relates to the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on sales and purchases in currencies
other than the functional currencies of the various group entities.

The group is exposed to currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the US dollar, British
pound, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish zloty.

Interest on loans is denominated in the currency of the cash flows generated by the group’s underlying
transactions.

The risk of exchange fluctuations was managed in the past using currency hedges when significant
differences are noted between cost and revenue in foreign currency and such differences were hedged
through currency swaps. These provided for the purchase/sale of agreed amounts in foreign currency at a
set exchange rate against the Euro.

At the reporting date, currency hedges were in place for Pounds.

**(35) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis (Continued)**

**Sensitivity analysis**

The appreciation of the USD, GBP, AUD, INR, UAH and PLN, as indicated below, against the Euro
at December 31, 2019 would have increased (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown
below. This analysis is based on exchange rate fluctuations that the group considered to be reasonably
possible at the reporting date. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates,
remain constant and ignores any impact of forecasted sales and purchases. The analysis is performed on
the same basis, although the changes in exchange rates differed to those expected, as indicated below.

PLN (10% change) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37 37 (30) (30)

_Other price risk_

As a result of the nature of its activities, the group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the
purchase price of raw materials, particularly plastics and aluminium.

The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of plastics has not been hedged as these raw materials
were not listed on international markets (the London Metal Exchange). However, this risk will be able to
be hedged in the near future given current developments in the listing of plastics on the international
market and corresponding hedging instruments.

The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of aluminium is partly hedged based on market needs
and outlook through derivatives which set the forward purchase price.

With respect to the fair value of market warrants, it is noted that, at December 31, 2019, their carrying
amount is calculated as the number of market warrants outstanding (19,367,393) at the official unit price
of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (€0.20).

**(40) Atypical and/or unusual transactions**

Pursuant to Consob communication dated July 28, 2006, it is noted that, during the year, Guala
Closures Group did not carry out any atypical and/or unusual transactions, as described in the relevant
communication, whereby atypical and/or unusual transactions are all those transactions whose significance/
relevance, nature of the counterparts, subject-matter of the transaction, transfer pricing method and
timing of the event (near year end) can give rise to doubts on: correctness/completeness of information
posted, conflicts of interest and the safeguarding of company assets, and of non-controlling interests.

**(41) Events after the reporting period**

**• Acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH’s assets through Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH**

On November 27, 2019, the Luxembourg subsidiary formalised its offer to purchase all the assets of
Closurelogic S.à.r.l. GmbH, German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures.

The offer is part of the competitive process launched following the voluntary insolvency proceedings
commenced by Closurelogic GmbH.

Subsequently, on December 16, 2019, the subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalised its offer,
through a notary, to be exercised directly or through the incorporation of a new company, requesting and
obtaining a break-up fee letter, which provided for the payment of €2 million to the bidder, should the
assets be sold to third parties.

In December, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. purchased a shelf-company,
Waterside XLII, which subsequently took on the name of Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH.

This company was subsequently identified as the purchaser of the assets of Closurelogic GmbH,
availing itself of the express right reserved in the notarial offer made on December 16, 2019.

On January 2, 2020, Closurelogic GMBH, under insolvency proceedings, formally accepted the
proposal made on December 16, 2019.

Consequently, on February 3, 2020, the German subsidiary, Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH,
finalised the purchase of all the assets owned by Closurelogic GmbH, with the exception of the shares of
the Turkish subsidiary, the purchase of which will take place after completion of the step-plan identified
following the due diligence.

Closurelogic Gmbh was founded in 1958 in Worms (Germany) and produces premium aluminium and
composite closures, specialized in the beverage and water glass bottles market. The transaction involves
the acquisition of the tangible and intangible assets of the Closurelogic GmbH business, including the
property located in Worms, for a total value of €7.2 million, the purchase of the raw materials and finished
products inventories for an amount of approximately €5 million, in addition to the payment to suppliers for
approximately €0.3 million.

In 2019, the activities acquired generated a turnover of approximately 45 million euros, with most
sales made in the glass-bottled mineral-water market. About 50% of these sales were realised in Germany,
with the remainder spread throughout Europe.

The acquisition allows the Guala Closures Group to have a significant share in the German market,
where the presence in terms of mineral water has been marginal until now.

Thanks to this acquisition, the Group become a major player in the glass-bottled beverage and
mineral water market, acquiring production capacity to grow further in this sector.

**• Share capital increase of Guala Closures France S.a.s. and new calculation of equity investments**

As a result of the losses incurred in prior years, on January 29, 2020 the share capital of Guala
Closures France Sas was zeroed, with a simultaneous resolution to increase the share capital by
€2,748 thousand.

As the other non-controlling investors—Les Muselets du Val de Loire M.V.L. S.A.S. and SACI
S.à.r.l.—decided not to subscribe the capital increase, the latter was fully subscribed by Guala Closures

**(41) Events after the reporting period (Continued)**

International B.V., which, to this end, waived part of the amount due from the French company,
converting the loan into share capital.

The capital increase was completed in February, resulting in the Dutch subsidiary owning Guala
Closures France Sas in full.

**• Subscription of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. capital**

On February 26, 2020, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalised the
subscription of 20% of the share capital of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd, innovative technology services
agency based in London.

Founded in 2015 as the world’s first IoT agency, SharpEnd is known for being a pioneering creative
technology Partner. The company was born with the desire to reduce the distances between products and
the involvement of consumers and includes AB-InBev, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever and Pernod Ricard
among its global customers.

The agreement between SharpEnd and the Guala Closures Group aims to offer innovative turnkey
solutions, integrating hardware and software in related packaging solutions.

**• Covid-19 (Coronavirus)**

The Group is closely monitoring developments of the global health situation following the spread of
COVID-19. Since February 22, the parent has provided its Italian plants with the tools needed to tackle
this situation. At present, all of the group’s production and sales activities are functioning as usual. Thanks
to our diversified geographical footprint, which enables us to best exploit any growth in the consumption of
local products as well as having a large number of sources of supply for our raw materials and services, we
believe that we can absorb supply chain and demand repercussions, although at the moment it is too early
to make forecasts on possible impacts over the coming months.

On behalf of the Board of directors
