On December 12, 2018, through its Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l., the Group completed the purchase of Scottish company United Closures and Plastics Ltd. (“UCP”) (subsequently renamed Guala Closures UCP Ltd (“Guala Closures UCP”), that boasts a long-standing presence on the Scottish market and supplies some historic brands of scotch whisky with which it has long-standing relationships. As a result of the above, the Issuer’s income statement and statement of cash flows information for the year ended December 31, 2018 include seven months of operations of Space 4, prior to the business combination with pre-merger Guala, and five months of operations of the Group. The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 was restated to reflect the effects of the completion of the purchase price accounting related to the following business combinations: (i) the Group from the date of the 2018 Acquisition (July 31, 2018) and (ii) Guala Closures UCP from the date of acquisition (December 12, 2018). The financial effects of the purchase price accounting included in non-recurring expense related to: (i) the fair value recognition of inventories at July 31, 2018 and (ii) the gain from the net assets acquired as part of the Guala Closures UCP business combination compared to the consideration transferred. The financial effects ceased in 2018. See note 6.1 to the 2019 Audited Financial Statements for further information on the 2018 Business Combinations, the Guala Closures UCP business combination and the purchase price accounting in connection therewith. Given the impact of the 2018 Business Combinations and the acquisition of Guala Closures UCP, the income statement and statement of cash flows in our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the comparative column in the 2019 Financial Statements are not comparable to the income statement or statement of cash flows for any subsequent period. The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the comparative column in the 2019 Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum has not been prepared on a pro forma basis to reflect the results of operations of pre-merger Guala for any period nor was it restated to give effect to such impact. As a result, such information does not include any financial information for the seven month period from January 1 to July 31, 2018 (i.e., until the date of the 2018 Business Combination) for pre-merger Guala and does not provide a complete picture of our business operations as though we had been operating on the same basis as prior to the 2018 Business Combination or as compared to our operations in 2019. We, therefore, do not present financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 under “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data” nor do we include a xii ----- discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 under “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For more information, see the_ 2019 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _Acquisitions, divestments and other transactions_ During the periods under review, we completed several acquisitions, divestments and other transactions of assets and companies through which we changed the size of our operations and which enabled us to expand into new geographical markets and product markets. In general, such transactions impact the comparability of our results of operations from period to period. As a result, our consolidated financial information may not be comparable following the date of such acquisitions or divestments. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors affecting _comparability of operations—Acquisitions, divestments and other transactions affecting our scope of consolidation and comparability of our results of operations”. Changes to Accounting Standards_ We made certain changes to accounting standards during the periods under review. Below we describe changes that had significant impacts on our Financial Statements during these periods. Other amendments did not have a significant impact in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods. See notes 2(c) “Changes in accounting standards” to each of the Financial Statements for further information on accounting policies adopted during the relevant period. _Application of IFRS 16_ The International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 16 (Leases) in January 2016. The Issuer has applied IFRS 16 starting from January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The accounting model for lessors has not changed substantially from the IAS 17 model. The Issuer has elected to apply the modified retrospective approach whereby the financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not adjusted and no first time adoption (“FTA”) effects were recognized in the reserves at January 1, 2019. Therefore, the comparative figures for 2018 included in the 2019 Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 17 on the same basis with those reported in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018. Prior to application of IFRS 16, the Issuer determined whether a contract was, or contained, a lease at the inception date in accordance with IFRIC 4 (Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease). The Issuer now determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on the new definition of IFRS 16. Specifically, the new standard establishes that a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has recognized new assets and liabilities for its operating leases (as per the definition of IAS 17) of land, warehouse and factory facilities, production lines, vehicles used within the facilities and IT hardware. Following the application of IFRS 16, the nature of expenses related to those leases has changed because the Group recognizes a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities and no longer accounts for lease payments. Previously, the Group recognized operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized. Short-term leases (i.e., with a term of less than 12 months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, which have been excluded from the scope of IFRS 16 as per the practical expedient, are recognized as operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For further information on the application of IFRS 16 and its impact on our financial information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting _the Comparability of Operations” and note 2(c) to the 2019 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this_ Offering Memorandum. _Recent Accounting Pronouncements_ A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after April 1, 2021. The Issuer has not early adopted the new or amended standards given the expectation that they will not have a significant impact on the annual financial statements. For further Recent Accounting Pronouncements, please see note 3 of the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. xiii -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We believe that EBIT and EBITDA are useful indicators of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. We believe that Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant measures for assessing our performance because they are adjusted for certain items which, we believe, are not indicative of our underlying operating performance and thus aid in an understanding of our Profit and EBIT. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by us to EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA of other companies. EBITDA as presented here differs from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the Indenture as described under the caption “Description of the Notes”, or for the purposes of any of our other indebtedness. The information presented by both EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC. Compliance with the SEC’s requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information. None of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with IFRS, as the case may be, or to cash flows from operations, investing activities or financing activities. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are: - the do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; xiv ----- - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. We also present Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Safety Closures, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Luxury Closures, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Roll-on Closures, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Roll-on for Wine Closures, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Other Revenue, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Europe, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Americas, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Asia, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Oceania, Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Africa, EBIT at Constant Exchange Rates, EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates, Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates, Adjusted EBIT at Constant Exchange Rates and Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates Spirits Market for certain periods, which were prepared by translating the results of a given period in each currency other than the euro, our reporting currency, applying the average exchange rate of such currency in the previous comparative period instead of applying the period-end exchange rate as we do when preparing our consolidated results.

Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures in light of the significant translation effects of movements in exchange rates due to the international nature of the Group’s business, the Group believes that computing Net revenue, EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA results for any given period at constant exchange rates is the most appropriate means to compare the Group’s current results of operations against the previous year. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the Group’s operating results as reported under IFRS. We also present the non-IFRS measures of Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted cash conversion ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt. - We define Net Working Capital as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables. - We define Net Capital Expenditure as Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets less Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; - We define Growth Capital Expenditure as Net Capital Expenditure related to discretionary investments to expand our geographical footprint or increase our manufacturing capacity and capabilities and cost savings and efficiency projects to optimize our operations, equipment and footprint. Growth Capital Expenditure also includes certain discretionary investments in the design, development and production of solutions with embedded NFC technologies; - We define Maintenance Capital Expenditure as Net Capital Expenditure related to critical ordinary course investments in tangible and fixed assets to ensure the continuing operation of our asset base; - We define EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure as Net Capital Expenditure related to applicable EHS laws and regulations and sustainability; - We define Senior Secured Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as the aggregate principal amount of the Notes excluding any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and Net Senior Secured Debt as Senior Secured Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing less cash and cash equivalents; and xv ----- - We define Total Financial Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, leases under IFRS 16 and other indebtedness under certain bank facilities (see “Capitalization”), excluding financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants and the put options in respect of the non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries in Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria and Belarus. Total Financial Debt excludes any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We define Net Financial Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing as Total Financial Debt as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing less cash and cash equivalents as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing. We use Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure and Adjusted Cash Conversion Ratio to monitor cash flow generation. Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted cash conversion ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt are not measures of liquidity under IFRS or U.S. GAAP and have limitations as an analytical tool, some of which include: - They do not deduct cash flows used in other financing activities; and - They do not deduct certain other items settled in cash. Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted Cash Conversion Ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Other companies in the industries in which we operate may calculate Net Working Capital, Net Capital Expenditure, Growth Capital Expenditure, Maintenance Capital Expenditure, EHS and Sustainability Capital Expenditure, Adjusted Cash Conversion Ratio, Net Senior Secured Debt and Net Financial Debt, or other similarly titled measures differently than us, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Through ongoing development and technological innovation, we believe that we are the top producer of non-refillable safety closures for the spirits industry with a market share by volume of units sold worldwide of more than 60%, the leading global producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures with a market share by volume of units sold of approximately 30%, and Europe’s largest producer of roll-on aluminum closures for wine, spirits and olive oil, in each case, in 2019. In aggregate, as of March 31, 2021, we operated from 30 production facilities, five research and development centers and three sales centers across 25 countries in five continents, and we produced and sold approximately 17 billion closures across than 300 models and in more than 100 countries in 2020. Our product lines include: Safety closures, Luxury closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine closures. We serve customers in several geographies and across four key end-markets: Spirits, Wine, Water and Beverages, and Oil and Condiments.

Our position is further consolidated by our extensive intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio, with, as of March 31, 2021, over 170 active patents and other IP rights related to the design and manufacture of closures, and continuous product innovation (over 35 new products have been launched over the last three years). We are the leading producer of safety closures by volume of units sold in a number of countries, including Colombia, India, United Mexican States (“Mexico”) and Ukraine. Notably, safety, closures are primarily used in emerging markets where there is a high risk of counterfeiting of alcohol. In addition, we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Poland (from where we serve the European market) and South Africa. We have a wide customer portfolio, which includes blue-chip major international and regional brands with whom we have built long-term relationships lasting more than 30 years in certain cases. We supply the top 10 premium spirits brands worldwide, including McDowell’s, Johnnie Walker, Bacardi, Jack Daniel’s and Absolut. The breadth and diversity of our customer base results in no single brand accounting for more than 3% of our net revenue during the last three years. 1 ----- Over the past decade, we have developed a strong focus on sustainability and ESG issues and strived to reduce the impact of our products and operations on the environment and climate change. We have made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and continuously focus, together with selected partners, on the study, prototyping and development of closures made of materials with a low environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and recycled polymers as well as biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials represented 27% of the raw materials used in our products. In November 2020, we launched a new range of sustainable products under the umbrella brand Blossom[™] and in December 2020, we signed an exclusivity agreement with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, in order to develop a line of T-bar closures manufactured using fully recycled ocean-diverted plastic. We are committed to reducing the impact of our operations and wider value chain on the environment by reducing waste, increasing energy and water savings and using renewable energy, which is well-aligned with our focus on staying at the forefront of product innovation. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016. With plants and offices in 25 countries and customers from over 100 countries, we also place great importance on diversity and inclusion as well as talent recruitment and management. As of March 31, 2021, the percentage of women holding leadership positions was 20.0% compared to 15.9% in 2018. In addition, following the appointment of the new board of directors on April 30, 2021, 44% of the members of our board of directors are women. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we generated net revenue of €564.4 million, loss of €0.2 million, EBIT of €31.5 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of €98.2 million, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.4%.

We are a renowned as a key partner in the spirits markets and sell our safety closures to some of the most prestigious multinational producers of spirits as well as a number of important regional producers in many of the countries in which we operate. For a spirits producer, packaging and brand are key elements in product identification and differentiation. Through technological innovation, we offer closures that enable our customers to better differentiate and position their brands against their competitors. We believe that the market for safety closures for spirits, including in emerging markets where premium brands are penetrating further, will continue to grow. See “Industry Overview”. Our safety closures help global manufacturers of spirits to protect against counterfeiting, particularly in emerging markets where the risk of counterfeiting is higher. As a result, we believe that we are the leading manufacturer of safety closures in various emerging countries, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. Both global and local manufacturers of spirits also use safety and luxury closures to differentiate their brands. Our aluminum screwcaps for wine closures are designed to facilitate opening and closing the bottle and feature liners that keep the oxygenation of the wine in check so the wine retains its quality and flavour longer. In this market, we serve some of the major wine producers as well as a number of important regional players, such as Casella in New Zealand, Distell in South Africa and The Wine Group in the United States. We expect that the market for aluminum screwcaps for wine closures will continue to grow due to the advantages of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures over traditional cork closures. We believe that we are well placed to benefit from this growth because of our ability to cross-sell to manufacturers who also sell spirits, our capacity for decoration and design, the economies of scale permitted by our extensive distribution network and the proximity of several of our plants to “New World” wine producers in Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.11,Americas,9.11.1,"Long-standing and trusted blue chip customer relationships, high switching costs and diverse customer base","Our consistent product quality and customer service have allowed us to develop strong and longstanding relationships with our customers, both in mature and emerging markets. We enhance customer loyalty through our research and development activities, which are often driven by the specific business requirements of our customers. We have strong and long-standing relationships with most of the large global producers of spirits, including Bacardi, Brown Forman, Campari, Diageo and Pernod Ricard, and we work closely with individual brands owned by these producers. We also serve major wine producers, such as Accolade, Castel, Caviro and Torres, Concha y Toro, Constellations Brands, Pernod Ricard and Treasury wines. In addition, we serve a broad range of regional and local producers of spirits and wines across all of our geographies. In 2020, approximately 30% and 70% of our net revenues was generated from sales of products to global and regional spirits producers, respectively. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers, which in some cases exceed 30 years. Due to the nature of bottle closures, we work in close partnership with leading spirits and wines producers in the study, prototyping and development of highly innovative closures specifically designed for their end-products, particularly safety and luxury closures, which often become integral parts of the overall packaging design featured in their advertising campaigns. For example, we have developed the “Neptune” closure for the SKYY Vodka brand, the “Florence” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Ballantine’s in both open pourer and non-refillable versions and the luxury quality “Ultis” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Chivas Whiskey. In recent years, the trend for customized solutions has resulted in the increase of the share of products that we co-design and co-develop with our customers, particularly for luxury closures. For example, we currently co-develop all of the luxury closures with premium spirit brands including, among others, Macallan, William Grant’s, Haig Club, Dewar’s. The trend for customized solutions has also driven the co-development of highly customized Safety closures with brands such as Jose Cuervo, Khortitsa and Russian Standard. At the same time, we continue to develop products that can be sold to all customers in specific end-markets, particularly in the wine and water closures market. The high degree integration of our closures with customers’ end-products and the fact that our closures are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection, makes it more difficult and costly for our customers to source alternative closures from our competitors. In addition, our longstanding, collaborative relationships with leading brands and our ability to leverage our global platform to serve their needs across multiple geographies have allowed our closures to be used in our customers’ products globally, often becoming industry standard. In safety closures, we are typically the sole supplier for a particular brand in a particular region. At the same time, our customer base is largely diversified and, 6 ----- while certain of our customers own multiple brands, no single brand accounted for more than 3% of our net revenue in 2019 and 2020. As a result of the time and resources invested in joint product development activities with customers, we also often receive recognition. For example, the e-closures equipped with NeˇSTGATE[™] NFC technology that we launched in 2020 with Vigneti Massa, a well-established winemaker located in Piedmont, Italy, received three prestigious awards in 2019: the Alufoil Trophy, the SIMEI Innovation Challenge and the WorldStar Award. In addition, in February 2020 we received, together with Vigneti Massa, a special prize for innovation in the wine sector at the inaugural Food & Wine Italia Awards. We believe that the multinational scope of our operations and our ability to meet our customers’ quality standards across geographic markets are increasingly important factors to our large global customers. In addition, our international presence allows us to operate in close physical proximity to our customers’ production facilities and meet their product and design requirements with greater flexibility and at a more competitive price and quality than our competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.11,Americas,9.11.2,Highly differentiated proprietary engineered product portfolio supported by a strong focus on research and development,"We believe that a key reason for our strong positioning in the global markets is the wide range of products in our portfolio, which we sell to customers operating in four key end-markets: spirits, wine, water and beverages, and olive oil and condiments. Our safety closures, which are highly engineered packaging components generally consist of two to 12 different components, range from tamper-evident seals to more sophisticated non-refillable devices covering the medium to high value added range of the closures market. Our luxury closures, typically designed for high-end spirits produced in limited quantities, are made of both aluminum and plastic, are customized according to the requirements of our customers and can include ribbons, seals and unusual shapes. Our roll-on closures and other product lines provide a range of products for spirits and mineral water and often provides an entry point for up-selling customers to other higher value added product lines. Our roll-on for wine closures are made from aluminum and customers can choose whether or not to include a tamper-evident band for protection against counterfeiting. In line with our long-term commitment to design sustainable solutions and increasing customer focus on sustainability in their own products, we recently developed and launched several sustainable solutions, such as products of our Blossom[™] line, including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and agglomerated cork that we developed in collaboration with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from completely bio-based polymers. Our research and development capabilities and our customer service functions enable us to continuously improve and expand our product offering, including in response to customer feedback, and the solutions we develop are often proprietary in nature and covered by patents, trade secrets and know-how, all of which ensures our product portfolio remains differentiated.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.11,Americas,9.11.3,"Focus on innovation, technology and product development","We are committed to product research and development and the digitalization of packaging, and we believe that we are a leading innovator in the closures industry, with a record of developing new and enhanced products with improved functionality, reliability and sustainability. In addition, the increased interconnectivity of our closures leads to closer integration between packaging suppliers and customers during the designing, ordering and delivering phases as closures are closely tailored to customers’ needs. We focus on the study, prototyping and development of highly engineered innovative solutions together with selected partners, particularly for safety closures, and we protect our know-how by applying for patents and other intellectual property protections for our products and processes. As of March 31, 2021, we held, or had lodged applications for, more than 170 patents, including 113 active patent families, 10 utility model families, 5 combined patents and utility model families and 44 protected industrial designs. Patents covered approximately 29% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. The proprietary nature of our products makes it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete with us, as our research and development capabilities allow us to strengthen our relationships with customers. 7 ----- We operate five research and development centers in Italy, Scotland, Mexico, Ukraine and Luxembourg. We believe that our developments allow us to derive a significant competitive advantage in our markets because more advanced products generally provide us with higher margins. During the last three years, we have launched over 35 new products. Examples of some of our most recent innovations include various e-closures with fully integrated NFC capabilities, including our new series of e-closures under the NeˇSTGATE[™] brand, which we started to develop in 2018, including the first wine bottles equipped with NFC technology in Europe, which we launched in partnership with Vigneti Massa in 2020, and e-closures specifically designed for Irish whiskey Jameson, which we launched in 2020. The NFC technology is revolutionizing conventional bottle packaging by integrating connectivity features into bottle closures for spirits, wine, olive oil and beverages. In particular, our NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures are equipped with a special microchip inside the capsule that is readable by all compatible smartphones, without downloading any specific application, providing consumers with the certification of authenticity and unlocking all information about the product, directly linking them to the brand and boosting customer engagement and loyalty. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] product range also comprises various QR code-based as well as more basic serial number-based models for wine and beverages. Most recently, we designed an electronic tamper-evident closure equipped with proximity sensors capable of detecting nearby objects in partnership with NXP Semiconductors, which we plan to launch in the coming months. Following our recent acquisition of a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London, we are able to offer our customers turnkey solutions, including digital platforms, integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions. We also have developed proprietary manufacturing processes that help reduce our operating costs and improve our profitability. In certain cases, we work with our customers to develop new and more competitive products. By offering support and by providing the technical expertise and service needed to develop new products, we have enhanced our relationships with our customers. In addition, in order to refresh our current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our research and development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual brands and equipped with innovative technological and sustainable features and with a sophisticated design, which we expect to launch between 2021 and 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In doing so, we have increased the number of geographical markets in which we operate, including Australia, Bulgaria, France, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany and Turkey and have expanded our presence in new segments and the types of products which we offer, including aluminum screwcaps for wine closures. Most recently, in 2018, we acquired United Closures and Plastics (now called Guala Closures UCP), a Scottish company with a long-standing presence in the Scottish market, which supplies some landmark scotch whisky brands. In 2020, we acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we acquired a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London focusing on integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions, which we increased from 20% to 30% in the first quarter of 2021.

We have a strong track-record of more than a decade of revenue growth and stability of Adjusted EBITDA margins within a very narrow and consistent range. We believe our business is resilient against the impact of adverse foreign exchange movements and raw materials price fluctuations. Furthermore, we believe that the diversified nature of our end-markets and customer base, coupled with our global presence have allowed us to maintain strong performance in 2020 8 ----- despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are supported by hedging arrangements covering a portion of our costs for raw materials via forward contracts. From time to time, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are impacted by the initial dilutive effect of strategic acquisitions; however, we strive to support our acquired businesses in order to maintain high group-wide margins as we strive to achieve industry leading profitability. As a result, we believe our average Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2015 to 2020 (including pre-merger Guala) was one of the three highest among our direct competitors within the industry. Our profit/(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, represented 2.4%, (1.0)% and (0.0%), respectively, of our net revenue. We have achieved strong Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.7%, 17.1% and 17.4% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. We were able to achieve these results leveraging both organic and inorganic growth, in spite of the fluctuations in exchange rates and raw material prices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the economic recovery starting in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, our sales volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, while our net revenue in 2020 decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to €603.8 million from €606.5 million in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, our overall sales volumes continued to improve despite the loss of volumes from sales in the European water and beverage market, which was negatively impacted by the restrictions implemented in the hotel, restaurant and catering (“HORECA”) industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, while net revenue decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, from €145.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €138.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the first quarter of 2021 increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9%, from €145.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 to €147.2 million. Our resilient industry leading margins coupled disciplined approach to working capital and capital expenditure led to a strong Adjusted cash conversion ratio of 88% in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Going forward, we intend to continue to focus on sustainability and ESG and have developed a comprehensive strategy to optimize sustainability across our operations and identified a series of sustainability targets. We have made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and have been, together with selected partners, studying, prototyping and developing closures made of materials with a low environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and recycled polymers as well as biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials represented 27% of the raw materials used in our products and we intend to increase this percentage to 35% by the end of 2025. Our product portfolio already comprises several sustainable products under the umbrella brand Blossom[™], including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from completely bio-based polymers. In line with our long-term commitment on sustainability, we intend to increase the share of environmentally-friendly solutions in our portfolio, by extending our existing range of sustainable closures and developing new solutions. In order to protect the environment, meet sustainability needs and contribute to the mitigation of the effects of climate change, we focus on minimizing environmental pollution, reducing waste, increasing energy and water savings and using renewable energy. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016, and we intend to decrease such emissions further by optimizing processes and optimizing loads and logistics across our supply chain. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, we implemented “Iris”, a new software developed entirely in-house, at our Spinetta Marengo facility in Italy, which is able to connect 150 pieces of machinery simultaneously, perform data analysis and make recommendations to the facility’s operator in line with our key sustainability principles.

In 2019, we started our operations in Africa following the inauguration of Guala Closures East Africa’s new facility in Kenya and opened a new facility in Belarus. In 2020, we entered the Turkish market following our acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH and its assets in Turkey. We intend to continue our geographical expansion by consolidating our presence in these and other markets, with a particular focus on specialty closures for the spirits market, including added-value safety and luxury closures. According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the global spirits closures market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% between 2016 and 10 ----- 2019, reaching approximately 37 billion closures in 2019, of which approximately 18 billion units in our key focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine and Mexico. According to this study, the market for safety closures represented approximately 38% of the global spirits closures market in 2019, while 42% was represented by roll-on closures. Despite the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a 9% decrease in the size of the spirits closures market in our key focus regions in 2020, a strong rebound is expected in 2021, with a full recovery predicted to occur between 2021 and 2022, on a country-by-country basis. In particular, it is expected that the global spirits closures market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.5% between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, which are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4% and 5%, respectively, between 2021 and 2024. We expect significant growth for the specialty closures segments in emerging markets. In recent years, these markets have experienced an increase in the consumption of branded spirits. We believe this has resulted in a greater demand for sophisticated anti-counterfeiting systems (such as our non-refillable safety closures) by the producers of such spirits and we expect such demand to continue to grow. In addition, producers are increasingly using safety closures as a marketing tool to create a premium brand image through the use of exclusive packaging. We believe that our leading position means that we are well placed to benefit from the expected future growth in the safety closures market worldwide, including in emerging markets. We aim to take advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence in these markets.

The screwcap market has also demonstrated a higher resiliency to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the overall closures market, showing a strong rebound in 2021 to date, which we expect will continue, and an expected growth at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% between 2021 and 2024. We believe that aluminum winecaps today account for approximately 23% of all bottled wine worldwide and we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth in this industry, especially as large regions such as North America and Europe move towards greater usage of aluminum winecaps. We believe we are one of the top producers of aluminum winecap closures, with a market share by volume of units sold in 2019 of approximately 30%. We expect growth in the wine closures market to continue due to increasing end-consumer preference for aluminum closures rather than cork. We believe that our leading position in this market means we are well placed to benefit from this growth. We aim to take advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence this end-market, by strengthening our relationships with wine producers, particularly those which are also active in the spirits market, by developing new and aesthetically attractive closures, including closures with safety elements and innovative features, and by consolidating our operations in the countries and regions where wine closures are purchased in large volumes. According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the market for closures for bottled water, measured by closures unit, grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% between 2015 and 2019, and is expected to grow further a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6% between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by growth in population and increased shift towards healthier beverages. In particular, the premium market for glass water bottles is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7% over the same timeframe. We believe we are currently recognized as a key closure producer in the premium market for glass water bottles, particularly following our acquisition of Closurelogic, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, in 2020. Going forward, we intend to take advantage of these strong growth trends in the glass-bottle closures market by leveraging our core business technology in metal screw caps for spirit closures as well as our expertise in tamper-evident systems. 11 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.19,Recent Developments,9.19.1,Impact of COVID-19,"Our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, we promptly undertook all actions necessary to minimize the social and occupational health and safety and financial impacts of the pandemic by defining and implementing flexible and timely action plans. Among other things, we invested in personal protective equipment and implemented a series of social distancing, cleaning and other health and safety measures to ensure the safety of the employees at our production facilities. At the same time, we successfully transitioned a portion of our corporate employees to remote working over a short period of time. To manage our cost structure, reduce our use of cash and further preserve our liquidity position during the pandemic, we implemented several COVID-19 crisis management initiatives including, among others, the reduction of temporary workers and other short-term cost reduction measures such as the reduction of marketing and travel expenses, which limited 15 ----- the negative impact on our profit margins. At the same time, we focused on reducing our personnel expense, including by placing certain employees on temporary furlough schemes, and took advantage of government support programs, including salary subsidies, in the United Kingdom and in countries across Europe, such as Italy and Spain. We also benefited from certain changes in tax rules introduced as a result of COVID-19 in most of our countries of operations, such as deferrals of certain tax payments and temporary reductions in social contribution payments. Since we manufacture some of our products for customers in the food and beverage industry, which is considered essential and ensures the continued supply of basic necessities, our supply chain, including raw materials supply and logistics, has generally not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our manufacturing plants were fully or partially exempted from business closure and lockdown orders in most of our countries of operations. As a result, despite a temporary halt of all or part of the operations at our facilities in certain countries, particularly in Asia, in certain South American countries and in South Africa during the first phase of the pandemic, we were able to maintain operations, at different degrees of capacity and for certain production lines, at most of our facilities in Europe and the Americas. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Position and Results of Operations— Principal factors affecting our results of operations—General macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”._ The restrictions and business closures implemented in our countries of operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business marginally in the first quarter of 2020 and more significantly during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted in lower sales volumes, particularly in the spirits end-markets. However, the various measures we implemented in the response to the pandemic and our focus on making our business more resilient and sustainable, coupled with the diversified nature of our end-markets and customer base and our global presence, have allowed us to maintain strong performance in 2020. Following the economic recovery starting in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we were able to benefit from the gradual lifting of various restrictions on the HORECA industries as well as the tourism sector, and our sales volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, while our net revenue in 2020 decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to €603.8 million from €606.5 million in 2019. While for the year ended December 31, 2019, we reported a profit of €14.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a loss of €5.9 million. In addition, while our Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 decreased by €15.6 million, or 13.7%, to €98.0 million from €113.5 million in 2019, our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by €9.3 million, or 8.2%, compared to 2019. We estimate that in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in volumes that negatively impacted our net revenue for the period by approximately €42 million. We estimate that this reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 by approximately €15 million. In the first three months of 2021, many governments across the world re-introduced restrictive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans and mandatory social distancing for both individuals and businesses, as well as required closures of non-essential businesses, particularly in the HORECA industries as well as the travel sector. Although we and our suppliers and customers have implemented appropriate measures under these restrictions, we believe that the restrictions currently in place have not had the same adverse impact on our business as those restrictions implemented in connection with the first wave of the pandemic in the first and second quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the HORECA industries had a significant negative effect on the European water and beverage sector (particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany), which heavily relies on on-premises consumption, and we estimate that this resulted in a reduction in volumes compared to the same period in 2020, which adversely impacted our net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 by approximately €8 million. We estimate that this reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted EBITDA by approximately €1 million in the first quarter of 2021. However, this reduction in volumes in the first quarter of 2021 was more than offset by increased sales volumes generated outside of Europe, particularly in the Americas, where revenues grew steadily in the spirits and wine markets, and in Asia, where revenues grew despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes outside of Europe also benefitted from customers increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises channels such as supermarkets and e-commerce. As a result, while our net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, to €138.3 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates for the first quarter of 2021 increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9% to 16 ----- €147.2 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. While for the three months ended March 31, 2020, we reported a loss of €6.3 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, we reported a loss of €0.5 million. In addition, while our Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 increased by €0.2 million, or 0.8%, to €24.3 million from €24.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates for the first quarter of 2021 increased by €2.5 million, or 10.4%, compared to the same period in 2020. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we reported a loss of €0.2 million. Overall, we estimate that in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in sales of approximately €48 million and a negative impact on our Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €15 million. More recently, a resurgence in infections in India during April and May 2021 resulted in the implementation of new restrictions in the country and the renewed shutdown of one of our facilities, which is having a negative impact on our sales volumes in the region. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of our plants are operational. The COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving rapidly and we are unable to predict how the outbreak and related government responses may affect our business in the future. We continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our employees, react to any operational developments, logistics disruptions and macroeconomic fluctuations and assess the ongoing impact of developments on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We expect our operations to continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for the foreseeable future and will continue to take the necessary steps to protect our employees and mitigate the risk to our business. _Our estimates regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are mainly related to estimates of volume loss deriving from (i) the temporary closure of, or temporary decrease in production volumes at, our production facilities, (ii) loss of orders from customers for which we are the exclusive supplier and for products whose destination markets were impacted by the various lock-down measures implemented on a country-by-country basis, (iii) bans on alcohol sales imposed by local authorities and (iv) supply chain issues such as, among others, restrictions on import/export, customs duties and freight. These estimates also take into account estimates of increases in sales volume due to (i) higher customer demand for safety stocks in order to avoid possible supply chain issues and (ii) increased sales in certain end- products markets (including the wine and spirits market) through supermarkets as a result of the increase in off- premise consumption. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to calculate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our net revenue and our Adjusted EBITDA are accurate, this presentation is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the results that we would have achieved had the COVID-19 pandemic not occurred (which might have been significantly different from the ones we indicate herein).

We distribute and sell our products in these and other countries. Our international subsidiaries (i.e., those incorporated outside of Italy) generated 87%, 88% and 88% of our consolidated net revenue in 2019 and 2020, and in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, 41% of our net revenue was generated by our subsidiaries located outside of Europe. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to seek to expand our sales and market share in various international markets, including by acquiring new companies to enable us to expand our product offering. The economies of some of the countries in which we operate in Asia, Latin America and Africa differ from the economies of Western Europe and in some cases present a greater risk profile. Many of these countries have implemented measures aimed at improving the business environment and providing a stable platform for economic development. However, the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to complete such a transformation may not be implemented fully or may not be successful, and the governments of these countries may implement policies, measures, controls or other actions which could restrict our business operations or harm our financial results. The risks inherent in the countries where we operate include, but are not limited to: - political, social and economic instability; - fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations; - changes in government policies and regulations, including more stringent regulation on the sale of alcoholic beverages, the packaging of alcoholic beverages or packaging in general, or in respect of labor laws; - tariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers; - varying tax regimes that could harm our results of operations, including withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries; - longer account receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; - foreign exchange controls or restrictions on profit repatriation; - nationalization or expropriation of property without fair compensation; - recessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets; - the introduction or application of more stringent restrictions on investments; - the possibility of natural disaster, war, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or other so social conflicts; 35 ----- - epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, ineffective and varying responses from local governments and competent authorities; - completion, including unfair competition, in certain markets in which we compete; - changes in the interest rate environment; and - fluctuations in local economic growth. We are exposed to these risks in all of our foreign operations to some degree, and such exposure could be material to our financial condition and results of operations in emerging markets where the political and legal environment is less stable. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to material adverse developments with respect to our international operations, nor can we assure you that we will be able to develop and implement systems, policies and practices to anticipate these risk before they arise or to insure effectively against or manage these risks adequately as and when they arise, or that we will be able to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations without incurring additional costs or at all. If we are not able to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In response to COVID-19, many countries around the world, including where we manufacture and sell our products, implemented a variety of measures to reduce the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions and bans, social distancing required for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. These restrictions have resulted, among other things, in significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity and demand, service cancellations or reductions and other changes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these restrictions have also disrupted our supply-chains, decreased customer demand for some of our products, particularly in the HORECA industries and the tourism sector, required us to transition a portion of our workforce to working from home and adversely impacted our ability to arrange for transport of our raw materials and products. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. As a result, we focused on reducing our personnel expense, including by placing certain employees on temporary furlough schemes, and took advantage of government support programs, including salary subsidies, in the United Kingdom and in countries across Europe, such as Italy and Spain. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national or local authorities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted demand for our products, particularly in the second and third quarter of 2020, and we may not be successful in allocating resources to address rapidly shifting demand among our product lines. The decline in our sales volumes was primarily due to the fact that the HORECA industries worldwide came under significant pressure as a result of the various restrictions implemented by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including alcohol sale bans and travel restrictions which resulted in a drop in consumption of spirits and wines especially in the on-premises and travel shops/duty free channels in certain geographies) and the related negative effects on the overall economic conditions in our key geographical markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. While in the fourth quarter of 2020 demand for our products recovered, this recovery was not sufficient to fully offset the decline that we experienced during the second and third quarter of 2020, and our total sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 remained below 2019 levels. As a result, we estimate that in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in volumes that negatively impacted our net revenue for the period. We estimate that this reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted EBITDA in 2020. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the HORECA industries continued to have a significant negative effect on the European water and beverage sector (particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany), which heavily relies on on-premises consumption, and we estimate that this resulted in a reduction in volumes 36 ----- compared to the same period in 2020, which adversely impacted our net revenue for the first quarter of 2021. We estimate that this reduction in volumes and net revenue adversely impacted our Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2021. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19”. The COVID-19 pandemic also partly contributed to the decrease in trade receivables from €104.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to €92.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and €97.2 million as of March 31, 2021, which, in turn, resulted in a reduction in our use of without-recourse factoring from €28.2 million as of December 31, 2019 to €26.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and €20.8 million as of March 31, 2021. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a further decrease in our trade receivables which, in turn, could negatively impact our ability to use without-recourse factoring arrangements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. More recently, a resurgence in infections in India during April and May 2021 resulted in the implementation of new restrictions in the country and the renewed shutdown of one of our facilities, which is having a negative impact on our sales volumes in the region. If the COVID-19 pandemics leads to continued or renewed shutdowns, including in connection with, or as a consequence of, the worsening of the recent outbreak India or elsewhere, or if economic disruption from COVID-19 continues, demand for our products and our net revenue may continue to be negatively affected. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to control the spread of the virus are uncertain and may materially restrict or hinder our ability to operate our facilities, due to measures we may need to take to assure the health and safety of our employees, lack of available workforce, disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and services or restrictions due to governmental actions. In addition, compliance with social distancing, cleaning and other health and safety measures implemented in response to COVID-19 in the various countries in which we operate may be burdensome and could result in the incurrence of additional costs and penalties. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and further restrictive actions taken by various governmental authorities in response to new strains of the virus, termination of government support programs and the timing of recovery of the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. While certain governments have initiated vaccination programs against COVID-19, such programs are progressing slowly in certain countries and there can be no assurance on if and when the population of those and other countries will be fully immunized, including as a result of new strains of the virus which may be characterized by higher transmission rates. Therefore, it remains unclear if or when the pandemic will cease and whether previously-lifted measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may be reinstated. There can be no assurance that the outbreak of COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious diseases will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience material adverse impacts to our businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s global economic impact, including any related recession. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,Our business is subject to fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials.,"Our costs for raw materials were €239.3 million, or 42%, of our net revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. As a result, fluctuations in raw materials prices have a direct impact on our production costs. The principal raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are aluminum and plastic resin, which accounted for €110.9 million (46% of total costs for raw materials) and €61.2 million (25% of total costs for raw materials), respectively, of our raw materials purchases in the year ended December 31, 2020. On average, 15% of our aluminum costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 and in the three months ended March 31, 2021 were related to purchases of aluminum ingots on the London Metal Exchange, both through spot transactions and forward contracts, while the remaining aluminum costs consist primarily of costs incurred in processing and converting ingots into coil and which are typically tied to fixed price contracts and incurred with the aim of making the aluminum ready for our production processes. Volatility in the prices of core aluminum and plastics affects our gross margins and operating results. Additionally, volatility in the price of aluminum may affect demand for our products by 37 ----- discouraging wine producers from switching to screwcaps by making it more expensive compared to alternative closures such as cork and synthetic cork. Plastic resins are subject to substantial price fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors including changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other petrochemical products from which resins are produced. In the first half of 2021 to date, the price of raw materials has been generally increasing and the availability of raw materials has been decreasing, including as a result of the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic in certain countries. For example, in the first three months of 2021, the average prices of plastic resins (HDPE Europe) increased by 10.7% and aluminum prices increased by 12.4%, in each case compared to the first three months of 2020. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas and unavailability of raw materials, including as a consequence of the worsening impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in certain countries, such as India, could materially adversely affect the price and supply of raw materials and negatively impact our supply chain. In the event that significant increases in raw materials and gas, oil and petrochemical prices occur in the future, our margins may be negatively impacted. Most of our sales are either made to customers on the basis of purchase orders or short-term contracts without cost pass-through clauses, providing us with no assurance that we can pass on price increases to these customers, or pursuant to contracts that generally allow only periodic price adjustments, which could delay our ability to pass on price increases to these customers, if at all. In addition, we may not be able to rely on an uninterrupted supply of raw materials from our regular vendors in the countries in which we operate, or from alternative sources in the event of a local or international shortage of the raw materials used by us, or we may encounter a shortage or discontinuation of certain types of materials purchased from one or more of our suppliers. While at present we do not hedge plastic resin purchases, as derivative instruments are not available in the markets, we have historically hedged a portion of our total aluminum purchases through forward contracts with brokers operating on the London Metal Exchange. In particular, we historically hedged the majority of our aluminum purchases, respectively. However, the use of forward contracts to reduce the impact of fluctuating aluminum prices may lead to an adverse effect should the price of aluminum move in the opposite direction to that which the forward contract was intending to hedge. Additionally, global trade and the introduction of import duties or tariffs may increase the costs incurred by the Group for the supply of our principal raw materials. In recent years, the United States introduced tariffs on certain metals produced in certain countries, including aluminum. While these tariffs did not significantly affect our activities, we could be materially adversely impacted if these tariffs were to significantly increase or if reciprocal tariffs were introduced in other countries in which we operate or from which we obtain supplies. Similarly, a global trade war could significantly increase the costs of our key raw materials and/or limit the availability of such materials from some markets. Any of these and/or the foregoing could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,"Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","We have significant non-euro denominated assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 15%, 13%, 9% and 5% of our net revenue from sales in U.S. dollars, Pounds Sterling, Indian rupees and Australian dollars, respectively. These currencies have experienced considerable volatility against the euro in recent years. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into euro. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the euro against these other currencies will affect the amounts attributed to these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For example, our reported results of operations were significantly impacted by negative translation effects of the appreciation of the euro in 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. In 2020, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates was €603.8 million (as compared to net revenue of €572.0 million). In addition, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was €147.2 million (as compared to net revenue of €138.3 million). The foregoing impact on our results of operations is mainly due to the translation effect of non-euro revenues generated during the periods and the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the Pounds Sterling as well as emerging market currencies such as the Indian rupee, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Argentinian peso and the Mexican peso. Given our presence and continuous focus in non-Eurozone markets, this risk is expected to increase over time. 38 ----- In addition, our key raw materials such as plastic resin and aluminum have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollars and we process a significant portion of such materials at our Magenta plant in Italy, incurring related costs in euro. At the same time, our customer contracts are typically payable in the currency of the country where the contract is signed, even if the customer may sell spirits or wine for a worldwide consumer base. Therefore, to the extent we incur expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as the related revenue, exchange rate fluctuations could cause our expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Principal factors _affecting our results of operations—Fluctuations in currency exchange rates”. Any of these developments_ could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.5,"A decrease in the consumption of spirits and/or wine could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.","We sell most of our products to producers of spirits and wine. Sales to spirits and wine producers represented 82% of our net revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Demand for most of our products is determined largely by the extent to which end-users consume spirits or wine, which in turn is partly affected by consumers’ disposable income, evolving customer habits and lifestyles, industry trends and population growth rates, among other things. In addition, luxury closures, which often include a high value-added component in their design and technology, may be particularly susceptible to consumer perceptions regarding brand value or wider societal trends, particularly in established markets. To the extent the brands for which we provide closures become less popular or experience a fall in consumption, our sales may likewise suffer. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a negative effect on the HORECA industries, and, in turn, led to decreased demand for products in the spirit market, which are typically consumed at bars and restaurants, and the water and beverage market, which relies heavily on on-premises consumption. Travel restrictions also negatively impacted sales of spirits through the duty free channel. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, our net revenue from sales to producers of spirits decreased by €55.4 million (or 13.8%) and €2.4 million (or 2.7%) compared to, respectively, the year ended December 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to lower demand and on-premises consumption by customers in the United Kingdom, India, Poland, Italy, Spain and Colombia, which resulted in lower sales volumes of spirits. In addition, in the first quarter of 2021, our net revenue from sales in the water and beverages market decreased by €5.1 million (or 29.1%) compared to the first quarter of 2020. Changes in levels of taxation and other governmental controls over the production, sale or marketing of spirits and wine, in certain countries in which we operate, such as in India, Russia, Scotland, Australia, South Africa, Turkey and some South American countries, may lead to a decreased supply of spirits and wine, and an associated decrease in demand for our closures. A decrease in the consumption of alcoholic beverages and a corresponding drop in the sale of spirits and wine could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, certain countries in which we operate, including India and South Africa, introduced alcohol sale bans which had a negative impact on our sales volumes in 2020. Regardless of actual levels of end-use consumption, a perception among producers of spirits and wine that demand may be about to fall could lead to a decision by such producers to reduce their stocks of spirits and wine, which could in turn lead to reduced demand for our closures. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,We may not be able to protect our intellectual property against competitors or maintain its value.,"Our future success depends largely on the development and maintenance of our intellectual property rights. As of March 31, 2021, we held over 170 active patents and other IP rights in respect of our products with approximately 29% of our sales in 2020 covered by patents. Third parties may challenge our intellectual property rights, produce counterfeit products that imitate our products, or come to know our trade secrets due to breaches of confidentiality agreements or otherwise. We defend our intellectual property rights whenever necessary before any competent authority and in any jurisdiction. We may spend significant resources monitoring, protecting and enforcing these rights and we may not be successful in our efforts to do so. The risk that we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights is likely to increase as we expand into new geographic areas, particularly emerging markets, including in Asia, where IP rights are less robust that more developed markets, and diversify into new product sectors, including our 39 ----- new “Internet-of-Closures” smart family products. If we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, our brands, sales volumes and market share could be negatively impacted, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our products are protected by patents and other IP rights for a limited period of time and therefore we periodically lose IP protection when those protections expire. We cannot assure you that upon the expiration of any of our patents or other IP rights, our competitors will not commence manufacturing products using similar technologies to those protected by our current patents or exploiting intellectual property that was previously protected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

For example, in 2018, we acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a long-standing presence in the Scottish market, which supplies closures to some landmark scotch whisky brands. In addition, in 2020 we acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we also acquired a stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London. We may seek out and consummate further acquisitions in the future where we believe doing so would further our strategic plans and offer growth potential. In particular, we may identify expansion opportunities that would help us grow in new geographical markets with high levels of alcohol consumption that we view as underpenetrated including, for example, South Africa and certain countries in Asia. In addition, we may identify acquisitions that would allow us to consolidate our position in the market for aluminum and plastics closures, and diversify our business through the expansion in the market for closures made of alternative materials such as cork as well as in adjacent product markets, such as food and beverages, including water, beauty and the pharmaceutical industries. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or complete any future acquisitions. In the event we were able to identify acquisition opportunities, any such transactions would involve significant risks, including the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and effects on our business relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be successful at integrating the newly acquired businesses, that they will perform as anticipated or that we will realize the anticipated synergies, efficiencies and other benefits. These types of challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to effectively manage the combined operations and assets or realize any of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Furthermore, there may be liabilities associated with the businesses we attempt to acquire, or we may finance acquisitions with debt which could in turn increase our leverage. The obligations and liabilities of an acquired business may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of such business and there is a risk that such historical financial statements may contain errors. We may also become responsible for liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence procedures in connection with our historical acquisitions and any future acquisitions. We have typically required the sellers in past acquisitions to indemnify us against certain undisclosed liabilities. However, we cannot be certain that the indemnification rights that we have obtained, or will obtain in the future, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.8,We are subject to continued increases in energy and freight costs.,"In addition to our dependence on primary raw materials, due to the energy intensive nature of our industrial processes, we are also dependent on a number of different energy sources, including fuel oil, electricity and natural gas. If, for any reason, certain of our energy supply contracts were terminated in a country where we have major operations, or were not renewed upon expiration, or if market conditions were to substantially change resulting in a significant increase in the price of fuel oil, electricity or natural 40 ----- gas, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable suppliers or suppliers capable of providing fuel oil, electricity or natural gas on terms or in amounts satisfactory to us. As a result of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. We are also dependent on third parties for the transportation of our raw materials, as well as the products we manufacture and sell. In certain jurisdictions, we are exposed to import duties and freight costs. Freight costs are influenced by carrier availability and fluctuating oil prices. Energy and freight costs represented 21% of our overall raw materials costs in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the cyclical nature of such commodity pricing, energy and freight costs presents a potential risk to our margins. Moreover, an increase in the selling prices for the products we produce resulting from an attempt to pass through increased energy or freight costs could have an adverse impact on the volume of units we sell and decrease our revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.9,"Consolidation in the spirits industry, the concentration of our customers and concentration of end-point distribution networks could undermine our competitive position.","The spirits market has experienced significant consolidation in the past fifteen years. For example, in early 2018, multinationals Diageo plc and Bacardi Limited purchased Gerber Spirit Company (the producer of Casamigo tequila and mezcal) and Patrón Spirits International AG, respectively, and in 2019, Campari Group acquired the French company Rhumantilles (the producer of Trois Rivières, La Mauny and Dusquene rum brands). Consolidation among our customers has resulted in increased price pressure. A further reduction in the number of customers could lead to increased price competition among closures suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and profitability. In each of the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, approximately 30.4% of our net revenue was generated from sales to our five largest customers, two of which contributed over 20% of our total net revenue in the same periods. We could lose revenue and market share if, following the consolidation of one or more of our customers with another company, a competitor were to become the primary closures supplier of any such resulting consolidated company. Alternatively, if that new company were able to extract more favorable terms from us, we could lose revenue and market share. If we lose customers because of, among others, pricing, our customers preferring our competitors to us, other methods of competition from our competitors or our customers’ shutdowns or insolvency, our revenue, operating results and financial position may be negatively affected. For instance, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our customers temporarily halted their operations, reduced orders or postponed their demand, which resulted in a decrease in sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. If in the future the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was to continue or worsen, our customers may have to halt their operations, reduce or postpone orders, any of which would result in further decreases in our sales volumes. End-point distributors are also consolidating. For example, U.S. wine distributors Republic National Distributing Company merged with Breakthru Beverage Group in 2018. More recently, Coca Cola European Partners acquired major bottler Coca Cola Amatil in Australia in 2021, creating Coca Cola Europacific Partners, the largest Coca Cola bottler in the world. Consolidation of our end-point distributors may result in increased pricing pressure on spirits and wine producers who may in turn lead our direct customers to seek to price their closures more aggressively. The majority of our supply contracts have a duration of only one year, and there is no obligation on our customers to purchase specified quantities during that period. There are also some clients to whom we sell customized and exclusive closures; in such cases we have multi-year, renewable contracts as the product is customized to that particular customer. We are reliant on a continuing series of contract renewals and/or purchase orders for our products. Thus, the loss of any of our major customers could significantly reduce our number of purchase orders, including those received at short notice and consequently cause our revenue to fall without providing us with sufficient time to replace the leaving customer with a new customer or adjust our stock levels appropriately by changing the amounts of our purchases from suppliers. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Our success also depends on our ability to react to changing consumer demands, preferences and habits in a timely manner. If we fail to keep pace with product development, anticipate consumer preferences, meet consumer demands or understand consumer habits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our businesses are subject to frequent and sometimes significant changes in technology and if we fail to anticipate or adequately respond to such changes, or do not have sufficient capital to invest in these developments, our profits may decline. Our future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to implement and utilize technology successfully to improve our business operations. We cannot predict all the effects of future technological changes. The cost of implementing new technologies could be significant, and our ability to finance these technological developments may be adversely affected by our debt servicing requirements or our inability to obtain the financing we require to develop or acquire competing technologies. In addition, our revenue and market share may suffer if any products or services that we plan to introduce fail to achieve market acceptance or experience technical difficulties. Introducing new products or features requires a high level of financial and managerial commitment to research and development. In the last three years, we made significant investments in product development and intend to continue to do so in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the investments we have made in product development and technology will generate expected returns by enabling us to increase or maintain market share. If we fail to maintain our level of investments in research and development, or fail to generate expected returns on those investments, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In order to meet our customers’ needs, including due to seasonality, we build-up inventory of products and develop new products to meet market changes and demands. Some finished and semi-finished products that we have in stock may become obsolete before being sold or we may realize a slower turnover than expected. Where the quantity of finished and semi-finished products in stock exceeds the demand from our customers, we may need to dispose of unsold or obsolete goods. Inventory not sold is written down in relation to their presumed possible use or future realization, and by including specific provisions in our accounts amending the value of the inventory where necessary. A significant impairment of inventory may result in a charge to our income statement.

For example, in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to halt operations at some of our facilities in the first and second quarter of 2020. In particular, we had to temporarily shut down all our facilities in India, and partially close some of our facilities in South Africa, where we had to suspend production for over one month due to a ban on the production of closures for spirits. In addition, we entirely converted some of our production lines in Colombia to make closures for disinfectants between March and May 2020. These total or partial closures and conversion had a negative impact on our sales volumes and net revenue in 2020, including as a result to costs incurred to adapt the business line to the production of new goods. Although we have appropriate insurance coverage in relation to material damage to property and the interruption of manufacturing resulting from natural or accidental events, amongst others, there is no guarantee that such coverage will be sufficient to compensate for damage and cost incurred by us. In addition, our existing insurance policies do not cover any losses arising from business interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—We may incur liabilities that are not _covered by insurance”._ In addition, we occasionally relocate manufacturing production and close down facilities or move parts of those facilities to other sites where it makes operational sense to do so for production efficiency reasons. For example, in the first quarter of 2018, we decided to close the secondary site of our facilities in Scotland (in the Broomhill Industrial Estate, Kirkintilloch) with a progressive transfer of the equipment and machinery to our main site (in the Old Mill Industrial Estate, Kirkintilloch). In 2019, we moved some of our production volumes from our facility in India to our start-up in Kenya. If we were unable to manage such closures and relocations efficiently or effectively, it could lead to disruption in our production capacities and ability to meet customer needs, thereby causing an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The work of our employees, including the transportation and delivery of raw materials to our production facilities and of our products to our customers is critical to our business. In many cases, before we take significant actions with respect to our production facilities, such as workforce reductions or closures, we must reach an agreement with the labor unions and employee works councils at such facilities. Any work stoppages resulting from employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level of customer service. In addition, we may become party to labor disputes with certain of our employees, including in connection with termination of their employment relations with us, and from time to time we may carry out collective dismissals. Such collective dismissals may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims. Any disputes with our employees or work stoppages resulting from strikes or other labor action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In Italy, dismissals for economic reasons are generally prohibited until June 30, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to Italian Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020 (Legge di Bilancio 2021) and Italian Law Decree No. 41 of March 22, 2021 (Decreto Sostegni). All workers performing their activity in Italy are covered by mandatory social security insurance. This system is financed by contributions from employees and employers, calculated as a percentage of the employee’s gross remuneration. These contributions represent a relatively high surcharge on labor costs. Also, in Italy, national insurance contributions to INAIL (the National Institute for Accidents at Work), which covers all professional risks, are mandatory. In addition to these social security measures, employers must set aside in their financial statements (or pay into supplementary pension funds) a mandatory severance payment (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto or TFR), which is deferred remuneration equal to 1/13.5 of any remuneration paid to the employees in connection with the employment relationship. Any changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations, including in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a result, product pricing and innovative technology are key competitive factors. Our main global competitors in the closures market for spirits are Amcor, Alpast, Alcopack, Berry Global Group, Torrent and Bernicap, with most of our remaining competitors being either local or regional companies supplying primarily only single regions of the world. In addition, our profitability is heavily influenced by the supply of, and demand for, closures. We cannot assure you that the manufacturing capacity for closures in any of our markets will not increase further in the future, nor can we assure you that demand for closures will meet or exceed supply. If manufacturing capacity for closures increases and there is no corresponding increase in demand, including as a result of restrictive measures implemented in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or if there is a decrease in demand but manufacturing capacity remains constant, the prices we receive for our products could materially decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

These laws and regulations impose increasingly stringent environmental protection standards regarding, among other things, the use, storage and handling of hazardous materials, discharge and disposal of factory waste, the remediation of environmental damage or contamination (in particular, sites operated for many years may be more susceptible to potential incidents leading to contamination), and safety standards relating to industrial installations and processes. We are also subject to stringent health and safety standards relating to our employees or other third parties at our production facilities. The scope of such laws and regulations varies across the different jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, our operations and properties must comply with the legal requirements in each jurisdiction, 44 ----- as well as EU and international legal requirements, including for example the EU’s so called “Machinery Directive”. It is possible that we may face unforeseen regulatory breaches in other EU countries in violation of applicable EU directives, regulations or laws and may incur other or more significant penalties for failing to comply with the applicable domestic law implementing such other directives, regulations or laws. Furthermore, such infringements could result in the need to implement potentially costly and unexpected measures to correct any non-compliance. The cost of complying with the laws and regulations across the different jurisdictions in which we operate, or the consequences of a failure to comply with them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our products are subject to food and beverage packaging regulations that govern the manufacture and marketing of plastic materials and goods that come into contact with, or can reasonably be expected to contact with, food and beverages. Food and beverage packaging regulations limit the substances that can be used in our products and regulate product purity and quality. These regulations typically set out a list of authorized substances that may be used in the manufacture of such plastic materials and establish a limit on the transfer of constituent elements from the plastic to food or beverages. We may be required to change raw materials or production processes to comply with future food and beverage packaging legislation or regulations addressing product and content safety in jurisdictions where we manufacture and/or sell our products, which could result in increased production costs. Changes in health and safety regulations in jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products could potentially lead to a decrease in demand for our products due to our customers preferring to source products from our competitors as a result of our failure to comply with such health and safety regulations. Moreover, the regulatory framework in the countries in which we operate often evolve and we may become subject to additional or different regulations and standards. Environmental and health and safety regulations as well as future events, such as changes in laws and technology, the promulgation of new laws or the development or the discovery of new facts or conditions could expose us to the risks of incurring substantial costs and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, we are regularly subject to the examination of our corporate income tax arrangements by the Italian tax authorities (particularly with respect to our financing and deductibility of interest) as well as the governing tax authorities in other countries where we operate. We routinely assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We are also subject to inter-company pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies pursuant to, for example, purchase agreements, licensing agreements or other arrangements. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, including the Notes, existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. We could also fail, whether inadvertently or through reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of various of our financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. For example, as a result of the reclassification of the interest rate of the withholding tax applied to payments we made in 2018 to our former parent company, GCL Holdings SCA, relating to interests on certain financial instruments, on April 29, 2021, we had to pay €0.5 million to the competent tax authorities using our provision for tax risks set up as of December 31, 2020. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our intercompany loans or transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions, limit our ability to deduct interest expenses, the imposition of withholding taxes, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest on intercompany loans or internal deemed transfers, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

For example, our business, financial condition and results of operations were adversely impacted by the effects of the global economic crisis that commenced in 2007-2008 and the Eurozone crisis that affected certain markets subsequently. In recent years, there 46 ----- have been challenging years in the world economy, due in part to political turmoil and/or upheaval in a number of regions, the occurrence of terrorist attacks, and more recently, a looming trade war, which has resulted in high currency volatility and tumultuous markets. Beginning in early 2020, global market and economic conditions have been negatively impacted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in severe economic downturns in our markets. Disruptions in the overall economy and volatility in financial markets could reduce consumer confidence and increase unemployment, negatively affecting consumer spending and discretionary income, which could be harmful to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In emerging markets in particular, where growth relies on a continued distribution of wealth, development of retail and distribution infrastructure and a reduction of trade barriers, our operations may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See also “—The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on _our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, which may be material”._ Demand for closures in the principal end-use markets that we serve is primarily driven by consumer consumption of the products for which we produce closures. General economic conditions affect consumption in our end-use markets, including spirits, wines and other beverages. Downturns or periods of prolonged economic weakness have resulted in the past, and could in the future result, in decreased demand for closures. In particular, our business could be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions that result in difficulties for any of our major customers, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic remains subject to unprecedented uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged and many national governments have instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. The continuation or worsening of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions or a renewed or future recession could result in, among other things, decreases in market prices for our products, a loss of customers spending in the spirits and wine industries and increased payment delays and/or bad debts as a result of our customers experiencing financial difficulty. Any deterioration in financial markets could also impair our ability to obtain financing in the future, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness to continue our ongoing operations or fund liquidity needs. According to Eurostat, the European Commission statistical agency, the real gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth rate in the Participating Member States (which are countries that have adopted the euro) has been sluggish in recent periods, growing at a rate of 1.9% in 2018 and 1.3% in 2019, and decreasing by 6.6% in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there are considerable divergences between GDP growth among the constituents of the Participating Member States. Concerns over inflation, unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, sovereign debt and the instability of the euro have contributed to increased volatility in recent years and diminished expectations for the economies of the Participating Member States going forward. A significant portion of our revenue is generated in the Participating Member States as is a significant portion of our production, sourcing and financing activities. The effects on the European and global economy of any exit of one or more constituents of the Participating Member States from the economic and monetary union, the dissolution of the euro and the possible redenomination of financial instruments or other contractual obligations from euro into a different currency, or the perception that any of these events are imminent, are inherently difficult to predict and could give rise to operational disruptions or other risks of contagion to our business, including our financing activities, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately binding across all Member States of the European Union, is a privacy regime regarding the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. The GDPR obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate, for example, to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR obligates 49 ----- companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data. We work to continue to be fully compliant with our obligations under the GDPR and have engaged an external data protection officer who, among other things, advises on our compliance obligations and assists us in ensuring that our software systems safely process personal data, which mainly relates to our employees. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties, including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Non-compliance or technical defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of such data could also result in damage to our reputation and otherwise harm our business. In addition, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage and we cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems.

In particular, we are exposed to the risk of sanctions under Decree 231, which provides for the liability of Italian companies as a consequence of certain crimes committed by directors, managers and/or employees in the interest of and to the advantage of such company. In particular, pursuant to Decree 231, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad including, among others, bribery, money laundering, corruption (including among private individuals), fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market abuse, certain tax violations, certain environmental violations and workplace safety violations in our interest or for our benefit, by individuals having a functional relationship with us at the time the relevant crime was committed, including third party agents, partners or intermediaries, unless we were able to prove that such individuals fraudulently violated such internal control model and it was for us impossible to avoid such violation. In such circumstances, we may be subject to fines, confiscation of profits or legal sanctions (applied as interim measures during the investigations), including, subject to certain conditions being met, provisional measures, the termination of authorization, permits, licenses, concessions and financing arrangements, including facilitated financing, suspension of our operations, or prohibitions on contracting with public authorities.

The Issuer has adopted an organizational and management model in compliance with the Decree 231 as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. However, adoption of organizational and management models does not in itself exclude the applicability of the sanctions provided for in the Decree 231.

While there are shareholder agreements in place for most of our subsidiaries with minority shareholders that mitigate against such problems, any significant disagreements between our Group management and those minority shareholders with respect to the identification and achievement of strategic and operation objectives or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of those companies. We have granted put options to minority shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries. These minority shareholders have the right to exercise those put options in certain circumstances, such as the termination of such shareholders managerial position without just cause, our failure to comply with the relevant shareholders’ agreement or articles of association of the relevant subsidiary, certain change of control circumstances or where it is not possible to validly adopt shareholder resolutions of the relevant subsidiary in the event of a shareholders’ deadlock. If one or more put options were exercised, we would have to pay an amount of money to the relevant shareholder or shareholders in proportion to the performance of the relevant subsidiary and such payment could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the relevant company. In our consolidated financial statements, the potential right of the minority shareholders to exercise their respective put option right if certain conditions are met is recognized as a liability based on the discounted estimated value of the put option at its estimated time of exercise. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of such liability was €28.7 million. In addition, the presence of minority shareholders at the levels of certain operating subsidiaries that are cash generative, such as Guala Closures Ukraine LLC and “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A., effectively dilutes the net income available to be upstreamed to Guala Closures International B.V. by way of dividend as such minority shareholders are entitled to their pro rata share of such dividends and therefore the amount of cash available to be upstreamed to the Issuer via distribution and/or dividend that can be used to service the Issuer’s indebtedness or used to execute the Issuer’s strategy is proportionally lower than if such subsidiaries were wholly owned.

If the Eurozone debt crisis was to be repeated, it is possible that one or more countries may default on their debt obligations or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency.

Furthermore, the Indenture will contain covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. Certain of these covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur).

Despite the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on that date has, among other things, led to increased customs and health and safety checks at the border, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the European Union. Due to the size and importance of the United Kingdom’s economy, the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the United Kingdom’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe after Brexit may continue to be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. In particular, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement will differ materially in practice from the past. Lack of clarity about future laws and regulations in the United Kingdom as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by, among other things: (i) the risk arising from changes in laws and regulations in the U.K.; (ii) the risk that movements in the U.K. pound exchange rates related to Brexit could damage competitiveness or profitability; (iii) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU may be subject to duties and tariffs; and (iv) the risk that goods moving between the U.K. and any member of the EU will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Any disruptions at English ports such as Dover and Immingham, resulting in delays and supply disruptions, could have a material adverse impact on our exports to the United Kingdom. Changes to the trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU are expected to result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. If tariff rates are levied on our exports from the European Union to the United Kingdom and customs-related costs increase, we may face additional costs in our operations.

Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the Issuer’s jurisdiction of organization, the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of each of the Guarantors and the jurisdictions the laws of which govern the security interest in the Collateral may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on such Collateral. Furthermore, the Collateral will consist of a pledge over the shares of the Issuer (only if SPSI acquires, directly or indirectly, 100% of the voting share capital of the Issuer), and pledges over shares and other capital stock and certain structural intercompany receivables of the Guarantors and the shares and other capital stock owned by the Group in “Guala Closures DGS Poland” S.A. In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt obligations, any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which could result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. The Indenture will not prohibit the Guarantors from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledges over the shares of the applicable Guarantors may result in the release of the debt obligations of the relevant Guarantor. Such release is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security _Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for a more detailed description of the various_ limitations on the security in each relevant jurisdiction. In addition, under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document.

As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders of _Notes”, the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of noteholders will be one_ or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 62 ----- Notes. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%) to bind all holders of the Notes, including noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or the majority required to pass a resolution, and change the amendment provisions.

A further deduction of interest expenses in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of fiscal EBITDA (i.e. risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”) determined according to the tax rules for the calculation of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL and of interest income exceeding the interest expenses not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward, respectively, for the following five fiscal years and without time limits. Interest expenses not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expenses that exceeds interest income is lower than 30% of ROL (utilized on the basis of the FIFO method). The carried forward ROL determined according to accounting rules under the previously applicable limitation provision could be offset only with interest expenses incurred on loans granted before June 17, 2016, to the extent that their maturity and their total amount committed have not been changed as of that date.

Based on the above rules, the Issuer (or the Group) may not be able to deduct for Italian tax purposes all interest expenses borne in each relevant fiscal year. Furthermore, any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application, including any possible further limitation to the use of the ROL of the Issuer and/or of the Group may result in the Issuer’s inability to fully deduct its interest expenses or further reduce the amount which it can deduct. In addition, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. On March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in LBO transactions are generally deductible for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in art. 96 Presidential Decree no.917 of December 22, 1986. The Circular Letter also indicates that shareholder loans may be re-characterized as capital contributions. Such re-characterization has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, based on the economic circumstances of the borrowing Issuer and under the substance-over-form approach as provided by OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The re-characterization provides that the: (i) interest incurred on any former or future shareholder loans are not deductible and (ii) interest payments made in respect of said shareholder loans may be subject to withholding tax on dividends. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing does not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the 63 ----- relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as such not compliant with the “inherence” principle set out under Italian tax law). Italian tax laws and pronouncements of the tax authorities are subject to change and positions that the Group takes for tax purposes may be challenged. In the past the Group has faced tax audits and investigations in respect of its financing which had resulted in the payment of fines by the Issuer. Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense or (iii) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax authorities of Italian tax law may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle, we may be unable to fully deduct our interest expenses or be subject to significant penalties or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

All payments in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts as they would have received in respect of such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required. The Issuer is not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes under certain circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (“Decree 239”) or pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree 461”), except where the procedures required under Decree 239 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents. In such circumstances, investors subject to Italian withholding tax will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes.

Holders of the Notes resident in such countries or territories but that do not satisfy the conditions set forth by Decree 239 (as amended or supplemented) or Decree 461 (as amended or supplemented), as well as certain categories of holders of the Notes who are resident in Italy, will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes. The regime provided by Decree 239 and Decree 461 and in particular the exemption from imposta _sostitutiva, which is in principle granted to holders of the Notes resident in countries that allow for_ satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, is also subject to certain procedural requirements being met.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law applicable to it. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. See “Limitations on Validity _and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ Furthermore, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes Guarantees of the Mexican Guarantors may be required to be limited to an amount that would not cause a default under the BBVA Bancomer Facility Agreements or the Mexican Guarantors may not be required to provide Notes Guarantees or Collateral. See “—The Notes will not be initially guaranteed by the Guarantors or secured by _the Collateral, and provision of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral is subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain other limitations” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—The BBVA Bancomer Facility Agreements.”_ 65 ----- For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Notes Guarantees, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests _and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for additional important information._",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the relevant series of Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and _the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ Further, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). In this regard, a longer period might apply to any collateral governed by Italian law which be granted after the Offering. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e. to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g. payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw back action. Under Article 64 of Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU. If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Transaction Security Documents.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The Indenture will provide, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. 66 ----- In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian law. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow the direct appropriation of certain pledged assets but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdiction as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdiction (including the Republic of Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under certain of these jurisdictions (including under Italian law), and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. The Collateral governed by Italian law will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on_ behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period may run from the moment such new security is amended, granted or perfected. If the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See also “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations”._ The Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will provide that the collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the 67 ----- Notes.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and the relevant Guarantors are incorporated or organized (as applicable) under the laws of Australia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Scotland and Spain. The Collateral will be governed by the laws of these jurisdictions, as well as Poland. In the event of insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi- jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The insolvency, administration and other similar laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to you as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar, including in the areas of creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of insolvency proceedings. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a result, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer and the enforceability of a Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral, including the pledge to be granted over the shares of the Issuer upon acquisition by SPSI (or such entity as elected by SPSI to be the direct parent of the Issuer) of 100% of the voting share capital of the Issuer (the “Security Interests”). A court may also, in certain circumstances, avoid the security interests and/or guarantee, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, where the relevant company providing the security interests and/or guarantee, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law is only a brief overview and describes certain generally applicable terms and principles which are defined under and subject to the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transactions at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that holders of the Notes return any amount paid under a guarantee or any security interest in the Collateral, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, to the relevant 68 ----- Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes and any Notes Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be preferences, transactions at an undervalue, a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and the Collateral under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire guarantee, including the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests, may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Notes Guarantees were issued, or Security Interests created, the Guarantors or security provider: - knew or should have known that the transaction was to the detriment of the creditors; - issued such Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interests with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others; - issued such Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interests in a situation where a prudent businessman, as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider, would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Notes Guarantee or Security Interests knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the relevant Notes Guarantee or Security Interests, on the basis that the relevant Notes Guarantee or Security Interests were incurred or created for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; - the Notes Guarantee or Security Interest was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. The criteria on which insolvency is evaluated differs between jurisdictions, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a guarantee or created a security interests if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or a security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or a security provider was insolvent on the date its 69 ----- Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Following completion of the Offers, as of June 18, 2021, SPSI, a vehicle indirectly held by Investindustrial and certain other Co-investors, held 94.9% of the Issuer’s share capital and voting rights, and is our controlling shareholder. In addition, SPSI’s ownership interest in the Issuer may increase following the completion of the Sell-Out and the Squeeze-Out. See “The Transactions” and “Principal _Shareholders”.

Investindustrial and its affiliates, including SPSI, could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of the Group’s business or sales of the Issuer’s shares which would result in changes to the Issuer’s shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.

In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.","The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” of the relevant Issuer. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement or other then-existing contractual obligations of the Issuer would allow the Issuer to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an obligation to mandatorily prepay and cancel all or part of the Revolving Credit Facility, an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Revolving Credit Facility, and other indebtedness or trigger a similar obligation to offer to repurchase loans or notes thereunder. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. If an event constituting a “change of control” (as defined in the Indenture) occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited, under certain financing arrangements or otherwise, from repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to the purchase of Notes or may attempt to refinancing the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership. Except as described under “Description of the _Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain a provision that requires us to offer to_ repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is met. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”. The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. In addition, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw the Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have 71 ----- the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer (excluding any early tender fee).

The application of IFRS 16 increased our current and non-current financial liabilities as a result of the recognition of €17.0 million in lease liabilities. Other operating expenses decreased by €5.4 million from the reduction in lease liabilities due to the application of IFRS 16, while financial expenses in respect of lease liabilities increased by €0.1 million. The application of IFRS 16 had a positive effect of €5.4 million on Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019. The application of IFRS 16 contributed to €5.8 million in amortization and depreciation for the same year. The reclassification of the finance lease assets that were recognized as property, plant and equipment under IAS 17 in previous years and now recognized as “right-of-use assets” under IFRS 16, which has replaced IAS 17, resulted in a decrease of property, plant and equipment by €12.2 million.

In general, such transaction impact the comparability of our results of operations from period to period. In addition, following an acquisition, we may be required to, or may elect to, make significant investments in the acquired assets or companies. The following is a description of the key acquisitions, divestments and other transactions completed during the periods under review. - In February 2021, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. subscribed a capital increase of its associate SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London and focusing on integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions, for an amount of £1.4 million (equivalent to €1.6 million), increasing the Group’s investment in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd to 30% of its fully diluted share capital. As the company is associated with the Group, it does not fall within the scope of full consolidation. - In September 2020, the German company Guala Closures Deutschland finalized the acquisition of the investment in Guala Closures Turkey as part of the Closurelogic business, after certain previously-agreed conditions were met. - The investment in GCL Pharma S.r.l. was sold in April 2020. - In February 2020, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalized the subscription of a 20% interest in the fully diluted share capital of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. - In February 2020, our German subsidiary, Guala Closures Deutschland, acquired the assets of Closurelogic, a German manufacturer specialized in the production of aluminum closures mainly for beverages and mineral water in glass bottles. - In January 2020, the Group acquired a non-controlling interest in Guala Closures France S.a.s. via capital increase. - Guala Closures East Africa’s new facility was officially inaugurated in Kenya in November 2019 and the company was set up to provide spirits producers in Kenya and the wider east African market with anti-counterfeiting closures featuring the latest technologies. - In January 2019, Guala Closures India Pvt Ltd paid €0.6 million as Axiom’s contingent consideration, as originally set out in the 2017 acquisition contract and in April 2019, Guala Closures India merged Axiom Propack. 83 ----- - In June 2019, Guala Closures Iberica’s assets were transferred to Guala Closures UCP.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.16,Principal factors affecting our results of operations,17.16.1,General macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"We are impacted by global economic conditions, including in consumer spending resulting from, among other factors, reduced consumer confidence, falling gross domestic product, rising unemployment rates and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Since early 2020, the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 and the consequent restrictive measures implemented by the public authorities of the affected countries has had an enormous social impact and a significant impact on general economic performance and on consumption and investments, leading to general uncertainty. We acted immediately to implement all actions necessary to minimize the social and occupational health and safety and financial impacts by defining and implementing flexible and timely action plans. From the outset, we worked tirelessly to ensure the utmost health and safety for our employees, customers and suppliers. We immediately implemented a series of protective measures for our personnel, investing in personal protective equipment to ensure that activities are carried out in accordance with best practices in terms of occupational safety. Our priority is and will remain ensuring the safety of our employees and business continuity. We quickly and responsibly took all steps and safety measures identified by the authorities in the various markets, introducing new protocols, work practices and safety precautions. These safety and prevention measures introduced at the onset of the pandemic remain in place and are continuously updated to comply with the new directives issued by the competent authorities. We also liaise continuously key business partners such as suppliers and customers has been further ramped up with the aim of ensuring business continuity. Specific business continuity plans have been prepared with our key customers. In addition to the measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as the distribution of disposable masks and gloves, social distancing between workers, measuring body temperature when entering the workplace and the sanitisation of all premises every two weeks, we entered into a COVID-19 insurance policy with AON, a leading insurance company, covering all our workers worldwide. As part of our focus on the communities in which we operate, we also began production of polycarbonate face shields in Luxembourg, which are sold to businesses in order to finance the free supply of such face shields to healthcare structures in Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg. To contain the spread, the governments of the various countries introduced increasingly restrictive measures aimed at limiting movement and contact between people, as well as shutting down—sometimes entirely—production activities in sectors classed as non-essential, allowing only essential activities and production to continue, including those of the food, drinks and pharmaceuticals sector in which the group operates, along with logistics services and transport. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of our production facilities are operational. Most of our production facilities continued to operate during the entirety of lockdown measures imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which we operate in compliance with the regulations for each country, as the type of activity carried out was classified among those that, except for temporary bans imposed by local governments, could continue to operate during lockdowns. In particular, all of our facilities in Europe remained operational in 2020 during the pandemic. Our facilities in Italy, Spain and France were considered part of the essential supply chain, and remained operational throughout the respective lockdowns. Our facilities in the United Kingdom and the newly acquired facility in Germany also continued to operate throughout the lockdown at reduced capacities. The facilities in Eastern Europe (i.e., Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Belarus) continued to operate at full capacity. Our facilities in Asia are among those that were most affected by the policies implemented by their respective governments to contain the spread of the virus. Our facilities in India stopped operations on March 22, 2020 because of the country’s total lockdown imposed by the local government and resumed operations on April 27, 2020 at reduced capacity because of the national ban on the sale of alcohol until early May and the shuttering of bars and restaurants until September, while the Chinese facility stopped during the period between January 24, 2020 and February 14, 2020. Production at our facilities in the Americas was able to continue during the entire pandemic, with the exception of Argentina where production was suspended for a limited 84 ----- period of time (March 20, 2020 to April 1, 2020), pending authorization to continue activities necessary for the essential supply chain. Our facilities in California (U.S.) and Mexico continued to operate as they are essential to the supply chain, and at sustained rates due to the growth in volumes for brands focused on off-premises and e-commerce sales, which accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chilean facility also continued to operate at full capacity and, in Brazil, operations never stopped since the government authorities have not implemented any lockdown measures. In Colombia, during the lockdown period from March 20, 2020 to May 11, 2020, production was converted to produce closures for disinfectants. The production of closures for spirits subsequently resumed, although sales volumes were depressed by the closure of public places of business by local government order until September, 2020. In Oceania, our facilities in Australia and New Zealand continued to operate as they are considered part of essential supply chains. In Africa, our facility in Kenya continued to operate and no local lockdowns were imposed on manufacturing activities, while the facility in South Africa was partially operational and, during the lockdown period from March 26, 2020 to April 30, 2020, only produced for the Water & Beverage and Pharma markets, which the South African government had classified as part of the essential supply chain. Conversely, production was suspended for the spirits market during that period. Our business was only marginally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, when the impact was limited to operations in India, China, Argentina and South Africa, where operations were ordered to temporarily shut down, as described above. In the second quarter of 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significant, with a loss of sale volumes mainly in our operations in: (i) India, where the government imposed a full lockdown of the country between March 22, 2020 and April 27, 2020 and banned the sale of alcohol from the end of March to the start of May with the shuttering of bars and restaurants until September 2020; (ii) the United Kingdom, where operations are mainly geared more towards global brands and the duty free market; (iii) South Africa, where the partial closure of the facilities between March 26, 2020 and April 30, 2020 meant that it was only possible to produce limited quantities for small niches of the mineral water and beverage markets and the pharmaceutical sector since the sale of alcohol was banned from March 27 to June 1, 2020 and from July 12 to August 17, 2020; (iv) Colombia, where production was converted during the March 20 to May 11, 2020 lockdown to produce closures for disinfectants and public places of business remained shuttered until September 2020; (v) Spain and Italy, which were the European countries hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business, but less so than in the second quarter and the effects remained mostly concentrated in India, Spain, Italy and Colombia. In terms of our end-markets, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt most heavily in the spirits market, being the sector with the greatest exposure to consumption in the distribution channel represented by bars and restaurants, where net revenue decreased by €55.5 million, or 13.8%, from €402.3 million in 2019 to €346.8 million in 2020 and Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates decreased by €31.5 million, or 7.8%, from €402.3 million in 2019 to €370.7 million in 2020. Severe social distancing restrictions resulted in the almost complete closure of the on-premises channel in the second quarter of 2020 and, in certain countries, in the third quarter as well. The strict limits to travel also adversely affected sales through the duty free channel. Restrictive measures were eased towards the end of the second quarter of 2020, with local governments gradually lifting shuttering orders on the HORECA industries in the third quarter of 2020, but certain restrictions continue to remain in place in certain geographies. Near the end of 2020, as cases rose again in Europe, local authorities ordered new containment measures, which included another round of restrictions on the HORECA industries and the travel sector. We were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic both in terms of decreased sales volumes and in terms of additional costs to ensure the safety of facilities and employees and lower production efficiency as a result of ensuring compliance with safety and social distancing requirements. These were partly offset by measures to contain personnel expense, lower travel expenses and government assistance. We incurred costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which primarily relate to purchasing personal protective equipment (“PPE”) for employees, sanitization and the adaptation of work areas to comply with social distancing requirements. In response to the decrease in sales volumes, we began introducing measures to contain personnel expense in the second quarter of 2020 in order to limit the effect on the profit margin, which resulted in a decrease in personnel expense, mainly in those European countries hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the United Kingdom, where the furlough schemes introduced by the government of the United Kingdom allowed us to reduce production on commensurate basis with the lower sales volumes, and in Spain and in Italy, where production was optimized by scheduling holiday leave for employees, concentrating production on the weekdays, avoiding production during the weekend and curtailing bonuses. In India and South Africa, where the extremely severe April 85 ----- lockdowns imposed by the respective governments resulted in a shutdown of approximately one month, personnel expense did not decrease in proportion to the drop in volumes as we also bore the personnel expense during the shutdown period, pursuant to local regulations. We were, however, able to reduce personnel expense in these countries, primarily due to the lower use of temporary workers in India and to fewer overtime hours worked, the greater use of holiday leave and the decrease in employee numbers in South Africa. In China, personnel expense fell as a result of the government’s reduction in social security contributions and the smaller workforce as seven employees resigned during our suspension of between January 24 and February 14, 2020. In Colombia, which was the country where our operations were impacted the most in the South American region, we were able to achieve savings on personnel expense due to the use of holiday leave and the relief granted by the Colombian government which suspended social security contributions for two months. We also received assistance to decrease personnel expense in the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Argentina, reductions in social security contributions in China and liquidity support measures, particularly the postponement of the deadline for payment of indirect taxes such as VAT in the United Kingdom and the reduction of the VAT rate from 19% to 16% in Germany from July to December 2020. Following a more challenging second quarter in 2020, sales on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates recovered in the third quarter and grew in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic started to ease. As a result, while our net revenue in 2020 decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to €603.8 million from €606.5 million in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the HORECA industries had a significant negative effect on the European water and beverage sector (particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany), which heavily relies on on-premises consumption, and we estimate that this resulted in a reduction in volumes impacting our net revenue by approximately €8 million in such period. However, this loss was more than offset by increased sales volumes generated outside of Europe, particularly in the Americas, where revenues grew steadily in the spirits and wine markets, and in Asia, where revenues grew despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales volumes outside of Europe also benefitted from customers increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises channels such as supermarkets and e-commerce. As a result, while our net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, to €138.3 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates for the first quarter of 2021 increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9% to €147.2 million from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our operations.

Certain of our products generate higher sales prices per unit volume and increases in sales of those products impact our average sales price volume unit sold. In particular, we generate the highest sales prices from sales of our specialty closures. In the periods under review, we have focused on increasing our portion of sales from products that have higher sales prices in order to support our margins. This policy contributed to the positive volume/mix effect of €12.0 million in 2020 and €7.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We calculate the volume/mix effect by consolidating period-on-period decreases and increases in sales volumes and changes in product mix (by product families and customers). In our calculation of the volume/mix effect, we also include the currency effect generated by the translation of sales invoiced in a currency other than the local reporting currency, by using the exchange rates of the relevant prior period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The Group is exposed to currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, pounds sterling, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish złoty against the euro, our Group’s reporting currency, as well as against the local reporting currency of each of our subsidiaries. In 86 ----- the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 15%, 13%, 9% and 5% of our net revenue from sales in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, Indian rupees and Australian dollars, respectively. We also have exposure to other currencies such as the Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Argentine peso, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Certain of these currencies have experienced considerable volatility against the euro in recent years which has affected our results of operations. For example, our reported results of operations were significantly impacted by negative translation effects of the appreciation of the euro in 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. By way of example to illustrate and quantify the impact of currency exchange rates on our results of operations that was significant over the periods under review, if we applied the average exchange rate of the currencies relevant to our business for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates was €603.8 million (as compared to net revenue of €572.0 million as reported) and our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates was €104.2 million (as compared to Adjusted EBITDA €98.0 million as reported), respectively. In addition, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €147.2 million (as compared to net revenue of €138.3 million as reported) and our Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates was €26.6 million (as compared to Adjusted EBITDA €24.3 million as reported), respectively. The foregoing impact on our results of operations is mainly due to the translation effect of non-euro revenues generated during the periods and the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the British pound sterling, the Indian rupee, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Argentinian peso and the Mexican peso. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures”. _Transaction risk_ Our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to purchases of raw materials such as plastic resin and aluminum which have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollars and are used to varying degrees in the production of all of our products. Our other fixed costs, such as energy, personnel and services related to production are typically denominated in the currency of the relevant production facility (e.g., euro for Italy, złoty for Poland, Brazilian real for Brazil, etc.). Additionally, our customer contracts are typically payable in the currency of the country where the contract is signed, even if the customer may sell spirits or wine for a worldwide consumer base. By locating production in many countries where our customers are based, we seek to match our operating costs with operating revenue in each of the major currencies in which we operate. To the extent that we have incurred expenses that are not denominated in the same currency as related revenue, exchange rate fluctuations have in some cases caused our expenses to increase or decrease as a percentage of total revenue. We also utilize of derivatives to manage movement in aluminum commodity prices. See “—Costs _for raw materials”. Translation Risk_ Our currency translation risk is primarily related to the recognition of revenue generated by subsidiaries during our period-end consolidation and reporting. To prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Group, we translate assets, liabilities, total revenue and expenses into euro at applicable exchange rates. To determine the applicable exchange rate, we use the average exchange rate for statement of comprehensive income items for the period in which we are reporting and the spot period-end exchange rate for balance sheet items. See note 2(d) to the 2020 Financial Statements, as well as the other financial information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and “—Critical _accounting policies” below. Both revenue and expenses that are denominated in foreign currency are_ converted into euro at the spot rates of the days on which they are recorded. In order to assist management to identify trends and compare performance across regions and business units, we report Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates and Adjusted EBITDA at Constant Exchange Rates basis which is prepared translating the results of a given period in a particular local currency applying the average exchange rate of the local currency in the same period of the previous year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.16,Principal factors affecting our results of operations,17.16.4,Costs for raw materials,"€263.7 million of our costs in 2019, €243.4 million of our costs in 2020 and €61.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 were related to raw materials. Raw material costs accounted for 43.5% of our net revenue in 2019, 42.5% of our net revenue in 2020 and 44.4% of our net revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are plastic 87 ----- resins and aluminum. We used a total of 35,481 tons of aluminum in 2020 and consumed more than 43,000 tonnes of different types of plastic (PE, PP, PS, PC, PET, etc.). Plastic resins and aluminum accounted for €15.9 million and €26.5 million, or approximately 26% and 43%, respectively, of the cost of all raw materials purchased in the three months ended March 31, 2020; €61.2 million and €110.9 million, or approximately 25% and 46%, respectively, of the cost of all raw materials purchased in 2020 and €79.1 million and €110.7 million, or approximately 30% and 42%, respectively, of the cost of all raw materials purchased in 2019. Raw materials prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Plastic resins are subject to substantial price fluctuations resulting from shortages in supply and changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other petrochemical products from which resins are produced as well as other factors. Aluminum prices generally exhibit less fluctuation than plastic resins. The price of aluminum has trended upward in recent years. Aluminum prices on the demand-side are driven by end users from the construction, transportation (mainly automotive) and consumer (largely packaging) industries. As we do not typically enter into long-term committed contracts with customers, our contractual arrangements with customers do not contain pass-through mechanisms that would allow or require us to make periodic adjustments in prices to account for commodity price fluctuations. As a result of the foregoing dynamics, generally, any increase in the prices of our raw materials has a direct impact on our production costs and operating margins unless we are able to raise prices. We believe that the relevant raw material prices to illustrate price trends are the LME/ton price for aluminum and for plastic resins, the high density polyethylene (“HDPE”) price and polypropylene and homopolymer price in Europe and the HDPE price and polystyrene price in India. See “Industry Overview”. By way of illustration, in the first three months of 2021, the average prices of plastic resins (HDPE Europe) increased by 10.7% and aluminum prices increased by 12.4%, in each case compared to the first three months of 2020. In 2020, the average prices of plastic resins (HDPE Europe) decreased by 12.1% and aluminum prices decreased by 6.5%, in each case compared to 2019, and in 2019, the average prices of plastic resins increased (HDPE Europe) by 1.7% and the price of aluminum decreased by 9.7% in each case compared to 2018. These increases and decreases contributed to corresponding changes in our total costs. We manage this exposure vis-à-vis customers through proactive renegotiation of prices with customers when raw material prices put pressure on our margins and rely on our long track record of delivering innovative new products and extracting efficiencies through reduction of raw material use to maintain, and even modestly raise, prices during low-commodity periods. Sales of closures are based on contracts and/or purchase orders that mean that at least part of any increase in the prices of raw materials can be transferred to our customers, when the contracts provide for periodic price adjustments. If this is not possible, we are able to manufacture similar closures due to our technological expertise using different materials mix that ensures, nonetheless, product quality. Given our wide product range, we can offer customers various solutions (using different materials) and to direct their choices to the higher value added luxury lines, thus better absorbing any raw material price increases without significantly affecting margins. We also employ commodity derivatives for aluminum to hedge a certain portion of purchases. On average, 15% of our aluminum costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 and in the three months ended March 31, 2021 were related to purchases of aluminum ingots on the London Metal Exchange, through forward contracts and spot transactions, while the remaining aluminum costs consist primarily of costs incurred in conversion and processing which are typically contractually fixed for a short period of time. As we typically purchase aluminum based on contracts that set prices by reference to the aluminum quotations on the London Metal Exchange in U.S. dollars, which are converted into euro at the average exchange rate at the month of purchase, we seek to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with aluminum price fluctuations by entering into forward contracts with brokers operating on the London Metal Exchange, whereby we purchase aluminum at a fixed price to protect our operating margins from price volatility. We have not historically hedged the risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of plastics as these raw materials are not listed on international markets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business is _subject to fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials” and note 38(b) to the 2020 Financial_ Statements. Other methods of commodity risk mitigation include the careful selection of our suppliers, in particular for plastics, where we seek out suppliers that match our pricing, quality and reliability of supply criteria. We have not experienced any significant difficulties over the past few years in obtaining sufficient quantities of the raw materials required for our production. We also continually seek to implement innovative product and process solutions aimed at reducing consumption of raw materials. 88 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, these markets combined represented 84% and 81%, respectively, of our net revenue. Accordingly, our sales volumes and results of operations depend to a significant extent on the level of activity and industry trends in these end-markets. For spirits producers, packaging and brand are key elements in product identification and differentiation. As a result, demand in this end-market is primarily focused on high quality, customized and reliable products that enable customers to better differentiate and position their brands against their competitors. We believe that demand for safety closures in the spirits end-market will continue to grow, particularly in emerging countries where premium brands are penetrating further and where the risk of counterfeiting is higher. Technological solutions, sustainability and zero-environmental impact packaging are also becoming increasingly important in both the spirits and wine end-markets. Spirits and wine producers as well as their end-customers are increasingly looking for products with fully integrated technological functionalities that enhance product safety and customer experience, as well as products with a reduced impact on the environment, that are recyclable and made with a higher share of recycled materials. We believe that these will be the key growth and demand trends for our products in the spirits and wine end-markets going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Our Net Revenue at 91 ----- Constant Exchange Rates increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9% from €145.9 million for the first quarter of 2020 to €147.2 million. The negative translation impact on net revenue in the first three months of 2021 was €(8.9) million, which was due to the appreciation of the Euro against almost all currencies with which the Group operates. The change in the consolidation perimeter from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021 impacted net revenue by €0.1 million, which represents the net effect from the consolidation of Closurelogic’s assets acquired in February 2020 in Germany and in September 2020 in Turkey (an increase in net revenue of €2.1 million) and the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020 (a decrease in net revenue of €2.2 million). The contribution to turnover as a result of this change in the consolidation scope as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 is not material. The increase in Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 was mainly due the positive volumes/mix effect of €7.3 million and the benefit of €1.8 million generated by our price increase policy. The increase in sales volumes was concentrated in the Americas, where revenues grew steadily in the spirits and wine markets, and Asia, where revenues grew despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These trends more than offset the impact on our net revenue of approximately €7.9 million as a result of an estimated reduction in sales volumes in the European water and beverages sector, which has been negatively affected by the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Italy, Spain and Germany, as well as lower volumes in Oceania.

Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates from safety closures increased by €3.5 million, or 6.4%, to €58.2 million from €54.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volumes in the Americas and Asia, which more than offset lower sales volumes in Europe. _Luxury Closures_ Revenue from luxury closures decreased by €0.4 million, or 5.2%, from €7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was mainly due to a negative translation impact of €(0.6) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from luxury closures increased by €0.2 million, or 2.5%, to €7.9 million from €7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The slight increase was mainly due to higher sales volumes in the Mexico, which were almost entirely offset by lower sales volumes in Europe. _Roll-on Closures_ Revenue from roll-on closures decreased by €4.6 million, or 9.4%, from €48.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €44.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, with a negative translation impact of €(2.1) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from roll-on closures decreased by €2.5 million, or 5.2%, to €46.3 million from €48.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to lower sales as a result of the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which mostly impacted the water & beverages market in Europe, particularly Italy, Spain and Germany. _Roll-on for Wine Closures_ Revenue from the sale of roll-on for wine closures increased by €1.2 million, or 4.3%, from €28.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €29.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite negative translation impact of €(0.8) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from wine closures increased by €2.1 million, or 7.4%, to €30.1 million from €28.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was mainly due to higher sales volumes in Poland, the Americas and Germany, where we started to operate in February 2020, which were partly offset by lower sales volumes in Oceania and the United Kingdom. _Other Revenue_ Other revenue decreased by €2.2 million, or 32.8%, from €6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, with a negative translation impact of €(0.3) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from other closures decreased by €1.9 million or 29%, to €4.7 million from €6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020. _Net revenue by geographical segment_ The following table provides a breakdown of net revenue by main geographical segment (i.e., based on the geographical location of the subsidiary of the Group that records the revenue rather than the location of the customer) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021: _Europe_ Net revenue from operations in Europe decreased by €11.1 million, or 12.2%, from €91.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €80.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, with a negative translation impact of €(2.4) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 of this region decreased by €8.7 million, or 9.6%, to €82.5 million from €91.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is mainly due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first three months of 2021, due to the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries, especially in Spain, Italy and Germany. In particular, the total decrease in net revenue generated in these three countries accounted for €8.8 million in the first three months of 2021. _Americas_ Net revenue from operations in the Americas increased by €3.5 million, or 14.4%, from €24.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €27.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a significant negative translation impact of €(4.9) million, recorded mainly in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 of this region increased by €8.4 million, or 34.6%, to €32.7 million from €24.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to the positive net impact on sales volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was driven primarily by customers increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises channels such as supermarkets and e-commerce, particularly in North America, which more than offset the negative impact on volumes due to the restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic, including in the in HORECA industries. _Asia_ Net revenue from operations in Asia increased by €0.5 million, or 2.9%, from €17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a significant negative translation impact of €(1.6) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 of this region increased by €2.1 million, or 12.5%, to €19.3 million from €17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to revenues growing in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 when they were already partially impacted by COVID-19. The estimated net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia was immaterial. _Oceania_ Net revenue from operations in Oceania decreased by €0.8 million, or 8.8%, from €9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a positive translation impact of €0.5 million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 of this region decreased by €1.3 million or 13.8%, to €7.9 million from €9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease in sales volumes resulting from the slow-down of the domestic wine market, the steady increase in exports of bulk wine and the recent reduction in wine exports to China. These factors have resulted in a supply surplus in the region, which led to greater competition and downward pressure on sales prices. In light of these negative trends, 94 ----- we started the process of reorganizing our business in Australia in order to align its ongoing costs with the changed market conditions, including by reducing headcount. _Africa_ Net revenue from operations in Africa increased by €0.3 million, or 7.3%, from €4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, despite a negative translation impact of €(0.4) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the three months ended March 31, 2021 of this region increased by €0.7 million or 17.8%, to €4.8 million from €4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is mainly due to the positive net impact on sales volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a negative impact in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This positive net impact was mainly due to customers increasing their safety stocks of end-products and higher demand on off-premises channels such as supermarkets and e-commerce, which more than offset the negative impact on volumes due to the restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic, including in the HORECA industries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by €2.7 million, or 0.4%, from €606.5 million in 2019 to €603.8 million. The change in the consolidation perimeter from 2019 to 2020 impacted net revenue by €23.7 million, which represents the net effect from the consolidation of Closurelogic’s assets in 2020 (an increase in net revenue of €30.9 million), the sale of the Spanish assets of the PET division in the second half of 2019 (a decrease in net revenue of €1.2 million) and the sale of GCL Pharma in April 2020 (a decrease in net revenue of €6.0 million). Excluding this net effect, This decrease was primarily due to the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Following a more challenging second quarter, sales on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates recovered in the third quarter and grew in the fourth quarter. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a positive volumes/mix effect of €12.0 million and price increases generated a benefit of €4.9 million. However, these positive effects were fully offset by the estimated impact of a loss of volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates from safety closures in 2020 decreased by €36.3 million, or 14.2%, to €219.8 million from €256.1 million in 2019, mainly as a consequence of the lower sales following the outbreak of COVID-19, primarily due to its impact on the spirits market. 101 ----- _Luxury Closures_ Revenue from luxury closures decreased by €3.1 million, or 9.5%, from €32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative translation impact of €(2.2) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates from luxury closures in 2020 decreased by only €0.8 million, or 2.6%, to €32.0 million from €32.8 million in 2019. The decrease in revenue from luxury closures was mainly due to lower sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. _Roll-on Closures_ Revenue from roll-on closures increased by €21.7 million, or 12.1%, from €179.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative translation impact of €(6.5) million. This increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in 2020, which increased revenue from roll-on closures by €26.3 million. _Roll-on for Wine Closures_ Revenue from the sale of roll-on for wine closures increased by €7.6 million, or 7.0%, from €108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €115.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, despite the negative translation impact of €(5.7) million. Our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates from roll-on for wine closures in 2020 increased by €13.3 million, or 12.3%, to €121.6 million from €108.3 million in 2019, mainly as a consequence of the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in 2020, which increased net revenue from roll-on for wine closures by €4.3 million, and the growth in sales in the United Kingdom, Chile and North America. _Other Revenue_ Other revenue decreased by €8.4 million, or 28.0%, from €30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease is mainly due to the sale of some of the Spanish assets of the PET division to third parties and the sale of GCL Pharma S.r.l. in the second quarter of 2020 and a decrease in sales as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to operations in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, which had a negative impact on our net revenue in Europe. The decrease was only partially offset by the positive contribution of €30.9 million in revenue from the acquisition of Closurelogic. _Americas_ Net revenue from operations in the Americas increased by €2.7 million, or 2.5%, from €109.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €112.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, despite the negative translation impact of €(18.4) million recorded, mainly in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020 increased by €21.1 million, or 19.2%, to €130.8 million from €109.8 million in 2019. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in this region led to significant growth in sales in the North American spirits market following the increase in off-premises demand and penetration in new businesses/customers, which had a positive impact, in Mexico due to greater sales in the U.S. market, which had a positive impact of €0.7 million, and the increase in sales in the Chilean wine market. _Asia_ Net revenue from operations in Asia decreased by €20.7 million, or 25.8%, from €80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020 decreased by €16.7 million, or 20.8%, to €63.5 million from €80.1 million in 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the drop in sales after the shutdown of facilities in India and China during the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and operations that were at less than full capacity in the subsequent months because of the contraction in domestic consumption following the ban on the sale of alcohol between the end of March and the start of May and the shuttering of bars and restaurants until September in India, causing an overall negative impact on sale volume in Asia compared to 2019 of €17.2 million. In addition, the decrease was partially due to the transfer of some of the volumes previously produced by our Indian subsidiary to the business start-up in Kenya. _Oceania_ Net revenue from operations in Oceania decreased by €1.9 million, or 4.7%, from €40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the negative translation impact of €(1.1) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020 decreased by €0.8 million, or 1.9%, to €39.3 million from €40.1 million in 2019. Sales in this region are mainly tied to the wine segment which has in recent years has been impacted by exports of unbottled wine that is then bottled in the country of destination. The delay in the bottling season due to the COVID-19 pandemic has partly eroded sales volumes in 2020. 103 ----- _Africa_ Net revenue from operations in Africa decreased by €1.7 million, or 9.3%, from €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a negative translation impact of €(2.2) million. Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates of this region in 2020 increased by €0.5 million, or 2.6%, to €18.8 million from €18.3 million in 2019. The decrease in revenue was also due to operations in South Africa and, in particular, the partial suspension of production from March 26 to April 30 following the lockdown imposed by the local authorities and the ban on the sale of alcohol between March 27 and June 1 and between July 12 and August 17. Specifically, production of closures for the spirits market in South Africa was suspended by the South African government and production was only allowed for the water & beverage and pharma markets that were designated as essential, causing an overall negative impact of €(2.5) million. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, operations in Kenya continue to grow at sustained rates, partly offsetting the downturn in South Africa.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Net personnel expense related to the acquisition of Closurelogic net of the disposal of GCL Pharma increased personnel expense by €7.2 million. Excluding this impact, personnel expense primarily due to the cost containment policies that we implemented in the second and third quarters of 2020 to mitigate the impact of the lower sale volumes on profitability following the global outbreak of COVID-19. This resulted in a decrease in personnel expense, mainly in those European countries that experienced more severe effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the United Kingdom, where the furlough schemes introduced by the government of the United Kingdom allowed us to reduce production on commensurate basis with the lower sales volumes, and in Spain and Italy, where production was optimized by scheduling holiday leave for employees, concentrating production on the weekdays, avoiding production during the weekend and curtailing bonuses. In India and South Africa, where the extremely severe April lockdowns imposed by the respective governments resulted in a shutdown of approximately one month, personnel expense did not decrease in proportion to the drop in volumes as we also bore the personnel expense during the shutdown period, pursuant to local regulations. We were, however, able to reduce personnel expense in these countries, primarily due to the lower use of temporary workers in India and to fewer overtime hours worked, the greater use of holiday leave and a decrease in in the number of employees in South Africa.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Current taxes in 2020 decreased by €3.2 million as compared 2019 mainly due to our lower results because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in relation to our business in India. The reduction in current taxes in the countries that experienced more severe effects from the COVID-19 pandemic was partly offset by an increase in the current taxes payables by the Group where actual results increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, such as, for example, our operations in Ukraine and United States. The decrease in deferred taxes is primarily due to the smaller reversal of deferred taxes on the gains recognized in connection with the purchase price accounting and, in particular, the one-time recognition in 2019 of the €4.0 million reversal of deferred taxes recognized on the gains that arose in connection with the purchase price accounting for our operations in India following the reduction in the tax rate applicable in India from 35% to 25%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We expect that these will continue to be our primary liquidity requirements. In connection with the Offers, the results of which were announced by SPSI on June 7, 2021, the change of control provision in our Existing Notes were triggered and the Issuer will be required in accordance with the provisions of the indenture governing the Existing Notes to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes to repurchase any or all of their Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Existing Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, unless the Issuer elects to redeem all of the outstanding Existing Notes at par prior to the date on which the Issuer is required to make such an offer. There is committed financing in place in order to fund the redemption, if required. We will apply the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with cash on balance sheet, to redeem the Existing Notes and pay accrued interest thereon, repay amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and pay fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds”. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and 109 ----- borrowings from financial institutions under our credit facilities, particularly the €80.0 million Revolving Credit Facility that will be entered into in connection with the Transactions. As of March 31, 2021, our current and non-current financial liabilities amounted, respectively, to €24.4 million and €504.4 million, for a total amount of €528.9 million, and, excluding unamortized transaction costs and the put option liability in respect of non-controlling investors and financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants, our total financial liabilities amounted to €500.9 million. As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing our As Adjusted Total Financial Debt would have been €500.7 million (excluding unamortized transaction costs, the put option liability in respect of non-controlling investors, financial liabilities related to the Market Warrants and any amounts that we may draw under the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the Refinancing). From time to time we engage in the sale of our trade receivables on the basis of without-recourse factoring arrangements in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. The COVID-19 pandemic partly contributed to the decrease in trade receivables from €104.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to €92.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and €97.2 million as of March 31, 2021, which, in turn, resulted in a reduction in the use of without-recourse factoring from €28.2 million as of December 31, 2019 to €26.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and €20.8 million as of March 31, 2021. Our current and prospective liquidity is monitored constantly. We have not experienced any significant changes in terms of collection or payment activities directly or indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that the available liquidity is adequate to cover current and prospective operating needs and debt service obligations. However, we face significant risks to our liquidity. For instance, our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including under the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility” and “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to our Indebtedness—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt obligations”._ We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity also include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a decline in EBIT from our operations, which could be caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole; - the failure of our customers to make payments due to us; - a delay by our customers to make payments due to us; - any further significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses related thereto; and - the need to fund maintenance capital expenditures. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduced or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity financing; and/or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We may not accomplish any of the foregoing alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. 110 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

These positive effects were partly offset by the €3.6 million decrease in net financial expenses and the €0.3 million increase in gains on the sale of non-current assets and the €0.2 million decrease in other operating items. Net cash flows from operating activities decreased €9.5 million from €86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the decrease of: (i) €21.2 million of higher loss before taxation partially offset by higher net financial expenses of €6.7 million and higher depreciation and amortization of €1.8 million; and (ii) €5.9 million in changes in trade receivables, payables and inventory. These decreases were partly offset by the €3.2 million improvement in cash flows for taxes, mainly due to the deferral of payment of indirect taxes such as VAT in the United Kingdom as part of liquidity support measures introduced by the government of the United Kingdom in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Cash Flows used in Investing Activities_ Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by €11.9 million from €22.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €10.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to lower outflows for M&A activities in the three months ended March 31, 2021, which consisted of €1.6 million for the acquisition of an additional 10% in the share capital of the Group’s UK associate SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., compared to €12.2 million for the acquisition of Closurelogic’s business in Germany and €0.9 million for the subscription of the first minority stake of 20% in the share capital of SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. in the three months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, cash flows used for Net Capital Expenditure decreased by €0.5 million from €9.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €9.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €1.9 million from €36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to M&A activities which generated net negative outflows of €6.2 million in 2020, including €12.4 million for the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in Germany and Turkey and €0.9 million to acquire the non-controlling interest in the UK company SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., which was partly offset by the €7.1 million generated by the sale of the equity investment in GCL Pharma as compared to outflows for M&A of only €0.6 million in 2019 for the deferred payment of the Indian company Axiom Propack. In addition, cash flows used for Net Capital Expenditure decreased by €3.7 million from €35.4 million in 2019 to €31.8 million in 2020. _Cash Flows generated (used in) Financing Activities_ Net cash flows generated (used) in financing activities changed by €25.2 million from an inflow of €16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to an outflow of €9.1 million for the three months 111 ----- ended March 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to higher proceeds from new borrowings to support the working capital increase and investing activities completed in the first three months of 2020. Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by €14.3 million, from €43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to the higher proceeds from new borrowings related to the acquisition of Closurelogic’s assets in Germany and Turkey and higher repayment of leases. _Dividends_ Pursuant to Article 20.2 of the Issuer’s by-laws, the net profit resulting from the financial results will be distributed among the Issuer’s shareholders, after deduction of the 5% to be allocated to the legal reserve, until this reserve will have reached 1/5 of the share capital, pursuant to what is resolved by the Board of Directors.

Net Capital Expenditure in the three months ended March 31, 2021, totalling €9.0 million, mainly related to investments made to increase production capacity, develop new products, perform plant maintenance and make EHS investments. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Group directed most capital expenditure specifically towards Europe (the facilities in Poland, Italy, Germany, Ukraine and Bulgaria), Asia (particularly India) and in Africa (especially in Kenya). Net Capital Expenditure in Italy was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, new product development and extraordinary plant maintenance. Net Capital Expenditure in Poland was mainly aimed at increasing production capacity. Net Capital Expenditure in Ukraine was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, plant safety and extraordinary plant maintenance. Furthermore, in Europe, Net Capital Expenditure comprised investments in new product development at our facilities in Bulgaria and our research center in Luxembourg, as well as significant maintenance expenditure for our plants in the United Kingdom and Ukraine. Net Capital Expenditure in Africa mainly related to extraordinary maintenance of our plants in South Africa and the increase in production capacity of our plant in Kenya. Net Capital Expenditure in Oceania mainly focused on Australia, where we invested in production efficiencies. Net Capital Expenditure in 2020, totaling €31.8 million, mainly related to work on plant and machinery to develop new products and expand production capacity and efficiency, in addition to considerable investments in EHS and sustainability.

Furthermore, in Europe, Net Capital Expenditure comprised investments in new product development at the facilities in France and Bulgaria and the research center in Luxembourg as well as for extraordinary maintenance on plants in the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany. Net Capital Expenditure in Asia was targeted, in particular, at our Indian facilities where we invested in extraordinary plant maintenance and new product development. Net Capital Expenditure in the Americas was mainly focused on our Mexican facility, with projects for plant safety and extraordinary maintenance. We also made smaller investments at all the other facilities across the region. In Africa, Net Capital Expenditure related mainly to extraordinary maintenance on plants in South Africa and the increase in production capacity at the facility in Kenya. In Australia and New Zealand, Net Capital Expenditure mainly consisted of small maintenance expenditures. Net Capital Expenditure in 2019 amounted to €35.4 million, mainly related to plant and machinery and covered, although to differing extents, all five continents where the group operates. In particular, capital expenditure was concentrated in Europe and mostly related to the facilities in Italy, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Net Capital Expenditure in Italy mainly related to the development of new products 114 ----- and the increase in production capacity, with a particular focus on the mineral water market and the extraordinary maintenance of facilities. Net Capital Expenditure in Ukraine mainly related to the development of new products, the increase in production capacity and the safety of the production facilities. Considerable Net Capital Expenditure in extraordinary maintenance and safety was made at the facilities of Guala Closures UCP, acquired in December 2018. Net Capital Expenditure at the Polish facility in 2019 related to the construction of the new warehouse and the development of production capacity and the extraordinary maintenance of the plant and machinery used. At the French facility, Net Capital Expenditure focussed on the reorganization of production with a new layout and new machinery. Finally, in Europe, Net Capital Expenditure went to new product development and increasing the production capacity of the our facilities in Spain and Bulgaria.

In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs. The Group has an option to apply a “concentration test” that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in the profit or loss statement. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the profit or loss statement. If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquirer’s employees (acquirer’s awards), then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement awards compared with the market-based measure of the acquirer’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to pre-combination service. 117 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units (“CGUs”). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the profit or loss statements. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. With respect to other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

They are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends as well as any tax arising from dividends and any interest and penalties imposed by the tax authorities following their review of the tax position of previous years which found a difference in tax due. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: temporary differences in the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. The income tax related to dividends are recognized when the dividend is approved. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its 118 ----- accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will affect tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The provisions are stated as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date or to transfer it to a third party at that date. If the impact of discounting the time value of money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The Group is exposed to currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish zloty. Interest on loans is denominated in the currency of the cash flows generated by the group’s underlying transactions. The risk of exchange fluctuations is managed by using currency hedges from time to time when significant differences between cost and revenue in foreign currency were noticed and such differences were hedged through currency swaps. These provided for the purchase/sale of agreed amounts in foreign currency at a set exchange rate against the euro.

These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables and financial investments. The Group’s exposure to credit risk depends largely on each customer’s specific characteristics. The demographics of the Group’s customer portfolio, including the segment insolvency risk and the country risk, have an impact on the credit risk. See note 38 of our 2020 Financial Statements for further information. The Group accrues a loss allowance equal to the estimated losses on trade and other loans and receivables. This allowance comprises both the recognition of impairment losses for material individual amounts and the recognition of collective impairment for similar groups of assets to cover losses already incurred but not yet identified. The collective impairment losses are calculated on the basis of historical payment statistics. Most of the Group’s trade receivables are due from leading operators of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage segment. Most of its trading relationships are with long-standing customers. The Group reduces its credit risk using supplier financing lines made available by its main customers and factoring without recourse part of its trade receivables. 119 ----- The Group’s historical figures indicate a modest amount of credit losses.

The Group’s approach to liquidity management is to ensure adequate funds are always available to meet its obligations at the expiry dates, both in normal conditions and at times of financial difficulty, without incurring borrowing expense at terms higher than market conditions. The Group generally ensures there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents to cover forecast short-term operating expenses, including those related to financial liabilities. Contingent effects arising from extreme situations that cannot reasonably be forecast, such as natural disasters, are excluded from the above. The aim of the Group’s financing strategy is to maintain a well-balanced maturity profile for liabilities to thereby reduce the refinancing risk.

The Group is currently exposed to interest rate risk as almost all of its financial liabilities is subject to the payment of interest at floating rates subject to short-term repricing, including borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and indebtedness under the Existing Notes. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will also be subject to such interest rate risk.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.135,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Principal markets,17.135.1,,"Guala is a world leader in the production and sale of aluminium and plastic closures for the beverage industry. Guala primarily manufactures closures for global premium and local brands in the global spirits and Roll-on for wine markets. It also manufactures closures for water and other beverages as well as for vegetable oils and other condiments. Packaging (bottle, label and closure) is an important consideration for spirits and Roll-on for wine producers worldwide and is increasingly becoming a significant point of differentiation as spirits and Roll-on for wine producers compete to attract consumers. The proliferation of spirits and Roll-on for wines available to the consumer at the retail level has made packaging increasingly important in conveying quality and brand image. Further, consolidation within the spirits and Roll-on for wine industry and the formation of several major international spirits and Roll-on for wine conglomerates with substantial advertising and marketing budgets has led to an increased emphasis on branding, especially as international spirits and Roll-on for wine producers increasingly pursue a strategy of “premiumization” and protection of their brands. Increasingly, local or regional producers in the emerging markets are also focusing on their packaging content in order to build new points of differentiation between their brands and competing brands. As such, spirits and Roll-on for wine producers, both in respect of global brands and local brands, work closely with packaging suppliers, including closures manufacturers, in order to design the desired image for their product and to help differentiate each product from its competitors. Closures have today become part of the brand image for renowned global spirits and Roll-on for wines, allowing an end consumer to identify his or her favourite brand and to build a relationship with the brand. The look and feel of a product’s closure has a significant bearing on the consumer’s perception of quality and consistency of the brand, which is especially important for premium brands. Further, as spirits and Roll-on for wine producers expand into the fast-growing emerging markets, protection of product quality and brand integrity becomes increasingly important. Given the high excise duties charged in many emerging markets on the sale of imported alcohol, emerging markets are highly susceptible to counterfeiting of alcoholic beverages, especially premium brands. Safety closures, which provide significant anti-counterfeiting protection to spirits manufacturers, are therefore important packaging components for both producers and consumers, providing producers with an ability to protect their brand image and integrity and consumers with the confidence that they are purchasing an authentic branded item that has not been counterfeited. The global closure market, including Roll-on for wine and Spirits, is expected to grow at approximately 2% annually from 2021 to 2024, mainly driven by the Spirits “Safety and Luxury” segment with its increasing penetration as well as “Roll-on for wine screw caps” segment, almost in line with historical trends (3-5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024). As a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Closure global market decreased by 8% in 2020 (representing a four billion units drop) to reach 55 billion units. Preliminary indications for 2021 show that the market has almost entirely recovered since then. Guala is currently heavily focused on Roll-on for wine and spirits with sizeable presence across all key regions. Europe remains the largest market for Guala, representing 59% of its 2019 total net revenue by main geographical segment (i.e., based on the geographical location of the subsidiary of the Group that records the revenue rather than the location of the customer), followed by Americas and Asia regions which represent respectively 18% and 13% of 2019 net revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.136,Spirits closures market,17.136.1,"Closure global market (Wine and Spirits), 2016-2024 (bn units)","The Spirits’ closures market is Guala’s core market. In 2019, Guala’s addressable market accounted for more than 70% of the total spirits packaging market (or approximately 37 billion units out of approximately 52 billion units). This includes metal screw and cork closures. 122 ----- Guala focuses on using product range and relationships with longstanding customers to “upsell” from basic to more sophisticated closures, with increasing value add which leads to higher price realization. There is a strong market growth trend that is expected to continue to strengthen in the next few years with Safety and Luxury being the most attractive spirits segments, with an expected annual growth for the Safety segment close to 4% between 2021 and 2024 and 5% for Luxury segment in the same period. The Roll-on segment is expected to grow at a lower rate of 1% between 2021 and 2024. Despite having similar trends across countries, several peculiarities and/or differentiated scenarios should be considered, especially in terms of consumer habits, COVID-19 impact and closure type growth trends, which require a country-by-country analysis: - India: the overall market is expected to grow from approximately 8.3 billion units in 2021 to approximately 9.4 billion units in 2024 at a 4.2% CAGR over the same period. Safety closures are expected to grow from 4.5 to 5.3 billion units over the same period, with Guala holding approximately 50 to 60% market share, being the leader in such market). Safety closures are expected to continue gaining market share from Roll-on closures (which are expected to grow from 2.7 to 2.9 billion units between 2021 and 2024) achieving approximately 6% CAGR between 2021 and 2024. COVID-19 had a severe impact on the Indian market, mainly as a result of the restrictions adopted by the government (e.g., the 40-day ban), and a full rebound is expected in 2022. The macro-economic downturn is mostly impacting the Roll-on closure sector (consisting of approximately 2.8 billion units in 2019), which are typically used on cheaper “country liquor” bottles); it is expected that after the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic dissolve, demographic and social shift towards upper classes will continue, driving higher quality spirits consumption which would in turn positively increase demand for Safety closures (that are mainly applied to more expensive spirits). - Russia: the overall market is expected to decrease by a 0.1% CAGR between 2021 and 2024 with approximately 4.4 billion units expected to be sold between 2021 and 2024. The Roll-on segment is expected to be the most relevant category (with approximately 1.9 billion units in 2024), with Guala ranking second with an estimated market share of 10 to 20%). Roll-on closures are expected to lose market shares by 2024 to Safety (with approximately 1.5 billion units in 2024) and Luxury (with approximately 0.6 billion units in 2024), due to a trend towards premiumization. - United States: The Closure market is expected to grow at approximately 2% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, with approximately 1.7 and 1.8 billion units sold in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Roll-on closures and other closures represent the over 90% of total market); however, it is expected that Safety closures (in which Guala holds a market share of over 50%) will gain market share. - United Kingdom: The Roll-on market had approximately 62% market share in 2019. The overall closure market is expected to increase by 2.6% annually between 2021 and 2024 (from approximately 1.5 to approximately 1.6 billion units in 2021 and 2024, respectively), supported by a rebound in local consumption after decreasing by 11% in 2020 compared to the previous year. It is expected that in 2022 the market will recover to the 2019 pre-COVID-19 levels. - Poland and Ukraine: Poland is expected to grow at 0.5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024 (with approximately 0.9 and approximately 1.0 billion units sold in 2021 and 2024, respectively). The Polish market is focused on Roll-on closures (with approximately 75% market share), which trend is expected to continue. The Ukraine market is expected to decline by 0.5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024 (with approximately 0.6 billion units expected to be sold 2024), Luxury closures (representing approximately 25% market share) are expected to further grow supported by the trend of premiumization. Both the Polish and Ukraine markets are expected to recover to the 2019 pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022. - Mexico: The closure market (with approximately 0.6 billion units expected to be sold in 2024) is strictly tied to export dynamics (mainly of tequila). The market is fairly balanced between Roll-on and Safety closures (with Guala Closures holding approximately 60 to 70% market share in the Safety sector), with Safety closures expected to gain approximately 1% in 2024 compared to 2021, supported by the trend of premiumization. The overall closure market is expected to grow at 3% CAGR between 2021 and 2024. The Closure market is expected to recover to pre-COVID-19 level in 2021. 123 ----- India and the United States are driving most of the growth in the closure markets, driven by strong consumption dynamics. China’s growth is driven by increasing premiumization, which offsets substantially flat consumption levels.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.136,Spirits closures market,17.136.3,,"The spirits market consists of brandy and cognac, liqueurs, rum, whisky, tequila and mezcal, white spirits (such as vodka) and other specialty spirits. Spirits closures typically have high client stickiness owing to their low incidence on final price/packaging cost making switching an unnecessary risk. At the same time, client relationship key drivers are proximity, caps performance and customisation (especially on Luxury) since closures are key to preserve organoleptic properties and to enhance branding. There are several types of closures for Spirits, categorised in four segments: (i) Roll-on, (ii) Safety, (iii) Luxury and (iv) Other. Guala’s core products focus on Roll-on, Safety and Luxury segments, which represent 71%, 23% and 6% of the Spirits markets, respectively. The Roll-on segment is mainly comprised of low price brands and more generally smaller bottle sizes. The main product from Guala is the Roll-on ROPP closure with basic tamper proofing, aluminium. This segment represents a true opportunity in terms of costs, as it is the lowest cost option-technology at scale. 121 ----- However, traceability is compromised with production and source information which can be easily counterfeited. The Safety segment consists of several offerings from more basic low-cost plastic systems to more complex combinations of advanced anti-refill and tamper-evident. The main product from Guala is the Anti-Refill insert (basic plastic insert) beneath with aluminium ROPP closure. This segment is mainly driven by guaranteed quality to consumer from both tamper and anti-refill, with product source traceable and verifiable. The Luxury segment includes a wide range of bespoke and Luxury closures. Guala offers a wide range of closures in this segment, from ROPP+ closures with additional basic Decoration added to one-off customized designs for highly premium products. This segment is driven by branding and customization, with high quality perception and unique propositions. However, the relative cost is lower as high cost per unit is applied but on higher priced bottles. Safety and Luxury segments have been out-performing the overall market with solid historical trend and strong outlook towards 2024. Guala is well positioned on both segments with a clear leadership on Safety (45-55% market share in 2019). There is sizeable growth available in East Europe due to further shift from grey spirits to official alcohol, as well as in India where solid future growth is forecasted, driven by ongoing premiumisation and safety focus. India is one of Guala’s most dominant markets, with 50-60% market share in 2019 in the Safety segment, and has a high forecasted annual growth of 5.8% from 2021 to 2024. Similarly, the United States is an important market for Guala, expected to grow at 4.4% annually from 2021 to 2024, where Guala is the market leader (holding 55-65% market share in 2019). Finally, the United Kingdom, with an expected 6.5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024) and Mexico, with an expected 3.3% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, are both countries where Guala Closures has a strong presence, with approximately 50% and 70% market share, respectively, in 2019. The Spirits closures market has grown at approximately 2% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, reaching approximately 18 billion caps in focus regions, which are India, Russia, USA, UK, Poland, Ukraine and Mexico. In such period, “Roll-on” closures remained almost flat with market share of approximately 42% share, unlike the “Safety” caps which reached 38% share growing faster at approximately 4% CAGR. Therefore, Safety closures are taking market share on Roll-on markets. The fastest growing segment has been “Luxury” with approximately 8% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, with a limited penetration (approximately 5%). The COVID-19 epidemic has severely impacted the closure industry, resulting in an approximately 9% decrease, with a strong rebound expected in 2021 and full recovery expected to be achieved between 2021 and 2022, depending on country by country dynamics. The post pandemic growth trends at approximately 2.5% annual growth between 2021 and 2024 are expected to be driven by positive outlook mainly in India, United States, United Kingdom and Mexico, with “Safety” and “Luxury” as top-growing segments.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.138,Roll-on for winecap closures market,17.138.2,,"The Roll-on for wine closures market comprises traditional corks, synthetic corks and aluminium Roll-on for winecaps, with corks traditionally being the predominant type of Roll-on for wine closure. However, there has recently been increased adoption of aluminium Roll-on for winecaps, due to certain advantages, including improved preservation of the organoleptic properties of Roll-on for wine, consumer preference for ease of use and storage, and lower cost of packaging. Corks, which deteriorate over time, do not perform as well when travelling long distances over extended periods of time and often cause contamination of the Roll-on for wine. Moreover, Roll-on for winecaps are not susceptible to natural cork taint issues and therefore substantially reduce risk of spoiling. As a result, we have seen significant growth in the metal screw cap market in recent years as Roll-on for wine producers, wholesalers and retailers increasingly substitute metal for cork Roll-on for winecaps. We believe that metal screw caps today account for approximately 23% of all bottled Roll-on for wine worldwide and we believe that Guala is well positioned to capitalize on future growth in this industry. Screw cap market volumes depend on the adoption of bottled liquids and the adoption of screw caps. On the one hand, bottled volume drivers depend on domestic demand (with Roll-on for wine volumes driven by population and per capita consumption); production (with volumes produced by the national Roll-on for wineries impacting import share of consumption); volumes of imported and exported bulk and bottled Roll-on for wines; and size of packaging (with bottle formats changes impacting the number of closure compared to the actual volumes of Roll-on for wine being sold). On the other hand, the screw cap penetration depends on, among others, consumer acceptance (with consumer preference and habits being slow and difficult to change, with traditional European countries historically preferring cork over screwcaps); production landscape (fragmented Roll-on for wineries versus fewer concentrated large importer can favor the adoption of screw cap over corks); export share and consumer preferences of recipient countries (high exporting countries can based their decision on the adoption of screwcaps on the preferences of end consumers in the countries where the Roll-on for wine is dispatched); and retailer penetration (with retailer preferring screwcaps as there is less risk of return for tainted Roll-on for wine). Guala is the global leader in the screwcaps attractive market (with a market share of approximately 25 to 35% and approximately 7 billion of units sold in 2019 and 2020), growing at 3% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, due to evolving consumer habits, and the ability of screwcaps to preserve production quality while having a low incidence on the price and costs of packaging. Furthermore, the screwcap market has also demonstrated a higher resiliency to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the overall closure market, showing a strong rebound in 2021, further boosted by an approximately 3% CAGR growth expected between 2021 and 2024 and approximately 8 billion of units expected to be sold in 2024. The overall 32 billion units Roll-on for wine closures market showed a slow but steady growth between 2016 and 2019 of 1% CAGR, which is expected to continue over the next years, supported by stable consumption in “Roll-on for wine countries” due to the undergoing product innovation and a broader consumer base. Screwcaps overall market was supported by favorable trends such as practicality, sustainability, enhanced performance and reduced or stable cost, with the screwcap market representing approximately 23% of the overall closure market in 2019 and further growth expectation in the next years (as it is expected to increase at a slow but steady rate of up to approximately 24% in 2024. 125 ----- Europe, the United States, China and certain other geographic areas spread across the globe represent the most important Roll-on for wine regions for Guala: - Europe: representing approximately 54% of the overall market in 2019, the European market has grown at 2% CAGR between 2016 and 2019, and it is expected to recover to 2019 levels by 2021 after a 7% decline in 2020, and then to grow by 2% CAGR in 2021. Guala has a strong presence in the area, with a market share of approximately 25% in 2019, ranking first in most countries and facing low competition from a limited number of local players. After declining by 1% CAGR between 2010 and 2016, the Roll-on for wine market remains substantially flat until 2016-2019, supported new products (e.g., Roll-on for wine rosé) perceived as healthier and able to address a broader customer base (such as young generations, women). We expect this trend to continue post the COVID-19 pandemic. Within such market, growth is entirely driven by increasing screwcap penetration which shows a slow but steady trend in countries such as Spain, Italy and France, while it is reaching saturation in UK and Germany where screwcaps already represented approximately 50% of the overall market in 2019. - United States: the United States represent an attractive region (representing approximately 10% of screwcap market in 2021) and it is further expected to grow by approximately 5% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, driven by a positive trend in the Roll-on for wine market which is preferred over other beverages. Guala is the third biggest player in the U.S. market with a market share of approximately 10 to 20% in 2019. - China: while the screwcap market represented only approximately 5% of total market in 2019, it is expected to grow at approximately 10% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by increasing penetration of Roll-on for wine culture in the Chinese drinking habits and by a slight increase of use of screwcap closures in the market. - Other: among the geographies in which Guala Closures operate, four areas account for approximately 30% of the market: - Australia and New Zealand, which account for approximately 15% of market share, record a strong use of screwcap closures that saturated the market, with this trend been in line with the overall Roll-on for wine market which is expected to grow at approximately 2% between 2021 and 2024; - Chile and South Africa record a strong use of screwcap closures, resulting in approximately 4% expected growth between 2021 and 2024.

Our position is further consolidated by our extensive IP portfolio, with, as of March 31, 2021, over 170 active patents and other IP rights related to the design and manufacture of closures, and continuous product innovation (over 35 new products have been launched over the last three years). We are the leading producer of safety closures by volume of units sold in a number of countries, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. Notably, safety, closures are primarily used in emerging markets where there is a high risk of counterfeiting of alcohol. In addition, we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Poland (from where we serve the European market) and South Africa. We have a wide customer portfolio, which includes blue-chip major international and regional brands with whom we have built long-term relationships lasting more than 30 years in certain cases. We supply the top 10 premium spirits brands worldwide, including McDowell’s, Johnnie Walker, Bacardi, Jack Daniel’s and Absolut. The breadth and diversity of our customer base results in no single brand accounting for more than 3% of our net revenue during the last three years. Over the past decade, we have developed a strong focus on sustainability and ESG issues and strived to reduce the impact of our products and operations on the environment and climate change. We have made a long-term commitment to the design of sustainable solutions and continuously focus, together with selected partners, on the study, prototyping and development of closures made of materials with a low environmental impact over their life cycle, including recycled aluminum and recycled polymers as well as biopolymers and composite polymers. In 2020, recycled materials represented 27% of the raw materials used in our products. In November 2020, we launched a new range of sustainable products under the umbrella brand Blossom[™] and in December 2020, we signed an exclusivity agreement with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, in order to develop a line of T-bar closures 128 ----- manufactured using fully recycled ocean-diverted plastic. We are committed to reducing the impact of our operations and wider value chain on the environment by reducing waste, increasing energy and water savings and using renewable energy, which is well-aligned with our focus on staying at the forefront of product innovation. We estimate that in 2020 we reduced our Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished products by approximately 8% compared to 2016. With plants and offices in 25 countries and customers from over 100 countries, we also place great importance on diversity and inclusion as well as talent recruitment and management. As of March 31, 2021, the percentage of women holding leadership positions was 20.0% compared to 15.9% in 2018. In addition, following the appointment of the new board of directors on April 30, 2021, 44% of the members of our board of directors are women. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, we generated net revenue of €564.4 million, loss of €0.2 million, EBIT of €31.5 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of €98.2 million, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.4%. We believe that our high margins are supported by our raw material cost management and our ability to manage raw material price fluctuations, global diversity and exposure to growth markets and ongoing management initiatives to improve production efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.142,Competitive strengths,17.142.1,Market leader in safety closures for spirits and roll-on for wine closures,"According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, in 2019, the global spirits closures market reached approximately 51 billion of units sold, of which approximately 18 billion units in our key focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine and Mexico, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.0% between 2021 and 2024, primarily driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, especially in the United States and India. According to the same study, Guala’s global addressable Roll-on and Safety closures markets reached approximately 37 billion units in 2019 (compared to 33 billion in 2016). In addition, the global market for Roll-on for wine closures reached approximately 32 billion units in 2019 (compared to 30 billion units in 2016) and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.0% between 2021 and 2024. We believe we are the market leader in the production of Safety closures for spirits with a market share by volume of units sold worldwide of more than 60%, and the leading producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures for the wine industry with a market share by volume of units sold of approximately 30%, in each case in 2019. We estimate that in 2019, our market shares for Safety and Roll-on for wine closures was six and four times greater than that of our nearest competitor, respectively. We also believe that we are a leading producer of aluminum closures for spirits in Europe. We believe that our leadership positions are sustainable due to our commitment to quality, research and development efforts, proprietary production technologies, long-standing customer relationships, excellent customer service and brand recognition. We are a renowned as a key partner in the spirits markets and sell our safety closures to some of the most prestigious multinational producers of spirits as well as a number of important regional producers in many of the countries in which we operate. For a spirits producer, packaging and brand are key elements in product identification and differentiation. Through technological innovation, we offer closures that enable our customers to better differentiate and position their brands against their competitors. We believe that the market for safety closures for spirits, including in emerging markets where premium brands are penetrating further, will continue to grow. See “Industry Overview”. Our safety closures help global manufacturers of spirits to protect against counterfeiting, particularly in emerging markets where the risk of counterfeiting is higher. As a result, we believe that we are the leading manufacturer of safety closures in various emerging countries, including Colombia, India, Mexico and Ukraine. Both global and local manufacturers of spirits also use safety and luxury closures to differentiate their brands. Our aluminum screwcaps for wine closures are designed to facilitate opening and closing the bottle and feature liners that keep the oxygenation of the wine in check so the wine retains its quality and flavour longer. In this market, we serve some of the major wine producers as well as a number of important regional players, such as Casella in New Zealand, Distell in South Africa and The Wine Group in the United States. We expect that the market for aluminum screwcaps for wine closures will continue to grow due to the advantages of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures over traditional cork closures. We believe that we are well placed to benefit from this growth because of our ability to cross-sell to manufacturers who also sell spirits, our capacity for decoration and design, the economies of scale permitted by our 129 ----- extensive distribution network and the proximity of several of our plants to “New World” wine producers in Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We enhance customer loyalty through our research and development activities, which are often driven by the specific business requirements of our customers. We have strong and long-standing relationships with most of the large global producers of spirits, including Bacardi, Brown Forman, Campari, Diageo and Pernod Ricard, and we work closely with individual brands owned by these producers. We also serve major wine producers, such as Accolade, Castel, Caviro and Torres, Concha y Toro, Constellations Brands, Pernod Ricard and Treasury wines. In addition, we serve a broad range of regional and local producers of spirits and wines across all of our geographies. In 2020, approximately 30% and 70% of our net revenues was generated 130 ----- from sales of products to global and regional spirits producers, respectively. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers, which in some cases exceed 30 years. Due to the nature of bottle closures, we work in close partnership with leading spirits and wines producers in the study, prototyping and development of highly innovative closures specifically designed for their end-products, particularly safety and luxury closures, which often become integral parts of the overall packaging design featured in their advertising campaigns. For example, we have developed the “Neptune” closure for the SKYY Vodka brand, the “Florence” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Ballantine’s in both open pourer and non-refillable versions and the luxury quality “Ultis” closure for Pernod Ricard’s Chivas Whiskey. In recent years, the trend for customized solutions has resulted in the increase of the share of products that we co-design and co-develop with our customers, particularly for luxury closures. For example, we currently co-develop all of the luxury closures with premium spirit brands including, among others, Macallan, William Grant’s, Haig Club, Dewar’s. The trend for customized solutions has also driven the co-development of highly customized Safety closures with brands such as Jose Cuervo, Khortitsa and Russian Standard. At the same time, we continue to develop products that can be sold to all customers in specific end-markets, particularly in the wine and water closures market. The high degree integration of our closures with customers’ end-products and the fact that our closures are covered by patents or other forms of intellectual property protection, makes it more difficult and costly for our customers to source alternative closures from our competitors. In addition, our longstanding, collaborative relationships with leading brands and our ability to leverage our global platform to serve their needs across multiple geographies have allowed our closures to be used in our customers’ products globally, often becoming industry standard. In safety closures, we are typically the sole supplier for a particular brand in a particular region. At the same time, our customer base is largely diversified and, while certain of our customers own multiple brands, no single brand accounted for more than 3% of our net revenue in 2019 and 2020. As a result of the time and resources invested in joint product development activities with customers, we also often receive recognition. For example, the e-closures equipped with NeˇSTGATE[™] NFC technology that we launched in 2020 with Vigneti Massa, a well-established winemaker located in Piedmont, Italy, received three prestigious awards in 2019: the Alufoil Trophy, the SIMEI Innovation Challenge and the WorldStar Award. In addition, in February 2020 we received, together with Vigneti Massa, a special prize for innovation in the wine sector at the inaugural Food & Wine Italia Awards. We believe that the multinational scope of our operations and our ability to meet our customers’ quality standards across geographic markets are increasingly important factors to our large global customers. In addition, our international presence allows us to operate in close physical proximity to our customers’ production facilities and meet their product and design requirements with greater flexibility and at a more competitive price and quality than our competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Our safety closures, which are highly engineered packaging components generally consist of two to 12 different components, range from tamper-evident seals to more sophisticated non-refillable devices covering the medium to high value added range of the closures market. Our luxury closures, typically designed for high-end spirits produced in limited quantities, are made of both aluminum and plastic, are customized according to the requirements of our customers and can include ribbons, seals and unusual shapes. Our roll-on closures and other product lines provide a range of products for spirits and mineral water and often provides an entry point for up-selling customers to other higher value added product lines. Our roll-on for wine closures are made from aluminum and customers can choose whether or not to include a tamper-evident band for protection against counterfeiting. In line with our long-term commitment to design sustainable solutions and increasing customer focus on sustainability in their own products, we recently developed and launched several sustainable solutions, such as products of our Blossom[™] line, including Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and agglomerated cork that we developed in collaboration with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from completely bio-based polymers. 131 ----- Our research and development capabilities and our customer service functions enable us to continuously improve and expand our product offering, including in response to customer feedback, and the solutions we develop are often proprietary in nature and covered by patents, trade secrets and know-how, all of which ensures our product portfolio remains differentiated.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In addition, the increased interconnectivity of our closures leads to closer integration between packaging suppliers and customers during the designing, ordering and delivering phases as closures are closely tailored to customers’ needs. We focus on the study, prototyping and development of highly engineered innovative solutions together with selected partners, particularly for safety closures, and we protect our know-how by applying for patents and other intellectual property protections for our products and processes. As of March 31, 2021, we held, or had lodged applications for, more than 170 patents, including 113 active patent families, 10 utility model families, 5 combined patents and utility model families and 44 protected industrial designs. Patents covered approximately 29% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. The proprietary nature of our products makes it more challenging for new market entrants to effectively compete with us, as our research and development capabilities allow us to strengthen our relationships with customers. We operate five research and development centers in Italy, Scotland, Mexico, Ukraine and Luxembourg. We believe that our developments allow us to derive a significant competitive advantage in our markets because more advanced products generally provide us with higher margins. During the last three years, we have launched over 35 new products. Examples of some of our most recent innovations include various e-closures with fully integrated NFC capabilities, including our new series of e-closures under the NeˇSTGATE[™] brand, which we started to develop in 2018, including the first wine bottles equipped with NFC technology in Europe, which we launched in partnership with Vigneti Massa in 2020, and e-closures specifically designed for Irish whiskey Jameson, which we launched in 2020. The NFC technology is revolutionizing conventional bottle packaging by integrating connectivity features into bottle closures for spirits, wine, olive oil and beverages. In particular, our NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures are equipped with a special microchip inside the capsule that is readable by all compatible smartphones, without downloading any specific application, providing consumers with the certification of authenticity and unlocking all information about the product, directly linking them to the brand and boosting customer engagement and loyalty. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] product range also comprises various QR code-based as well as more basic serial number-based models for wine and beverages. Most recently, we designed an electronic tamper-evident closure equipped with proximity sensors capable of detecting nearby objects in partnership with NXP Semiconductors, which we plan to launch in the coming months. Following our recent acquisition of a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London, we are able to offer our customers turnkey solutions, including digital platforms, integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions. We also have developed proprietary manufacturing processes that help reduce our operating costs and improve our profitability. In certain cases, we work with our customers to develop new and more competitive products. By offering support and by providing the technical expertise and service needed to develop new products, we have enhanced our relationships with our customers. In addition, in order to refresh our current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our research and development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual brands and equipped with innovative technological and sustainable features and with a sophisticated design, which we expect to launch between 2021 and 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We have a strong track-record of more than a decade of revenue growth and stability of Adjusted EBITDA margins within a very narrow and consistent range. We believe our business is resilient against the impact of adverse foreign exchange movements and raw materials price fluctuations. Furthermore, we believe that the diversified nature of our end-markets and customer base, coupled with our global presence have allowed us to maintain strong performance in 2020 despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are supported by hedging arrangements covering a portion of our costs for raw materials via forward contracts. From time to time, our Adjusted EBITDA margins are impacted by the initial dilutive effect of strategic acquisitions; however, we strive to support our acquired businesses in order to maintain high group-wide margins as we strive to achieve industry leading profitability. As a result, we believe our average Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2015 to 2020 (including pre-merger Guala) was one of the three highest among our direct competitors within the industry. Our profit/(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, represented 2.4%, (1.0)% and (0.0%), respectively, of our net revenue. We have achieved strong Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.7%, 17.1% and 17.4% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. We were able to achieve these results leveraging both organic and inorganic growth, in spite of the fluctuations in exchange rates and raw material prices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the economic recovery starting in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, our sales volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, while our net revenue in 2020 decreased by €34.5 million, or 5.7%, to €572.0 million from €606.5 million in 2019, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020 decreased by only €2.7 million, or 0.4%, to €603.8 million from €606.5 million in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, our overall sales volumes continued to improve despite the loss of volumes from sales in the European water and beverage market, which was negatively impacted by the restrictions implemented in the HORECA industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, while net revenue decreased by €7.6 million, or 5.2%, from €145.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €138.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, our Net Revenue at Constant Exchange Rates in the first quarter of 2021 increased by €1.3 million, or 0.9%, from €145.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 to €147.2 million. Our resilient industry leading margins coupled disciplined approach to working capital and capital expenditure led to a strong Adjusted cash conversion ratio of 88% in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

In 2019, we started our operations in Africa following the inauguration of Guala Closures East Africa’s new facility in Kenya and opened a new facility in Belarus. In 2020, we entered the Turkish market following our acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH and its assets in Turkey. We intend to continue our geographical expansion by consolidating our presence in these and other markets, with a particular focus on specialty closures for the spirits market, including added-value safety and luxury closures. According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the global spirits closures market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% between 2016 and 2019, reaching approximately 37 billion closures in 2019, of which approximately 18 billion units in our key focus regions of India, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Ukraine and Mexico. According to this study, the market for safety closures represented approximately 38% of the global spirits closures market in 2019, while 42% was represented by roll-on closures. Despite the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a 9% decrease in the size of the spirits closures market in our key focus regions in 2020, a strong rebound is expected in 2021, with a full recovery predicted to occur between 2021 and 2022, on a country-by-country basis. In particular, it is expected that the global spirits closures market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.5% between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by growth in the safety and luxury closures markets, which are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4% and 5%, respectively, between 2021 and 2024. We expect significant growth for the specialty closures segments in emerging markets. In recent years, these markets have experienced an increase in the consumption of branded spirits. We believe this has resulted in a greater demand for sophisticated anti-counterfeiting systems (such as our non-refillable safety closures) by the producers of such spirits and we expect such demand to continue to grow. In addition, producers are increasingly using safety closures as a marketing tool to create a premium brand image through the use of exclusive packaging. We believe that our leading position means that we are well placed to benefit from the expected future growth in the safety closures market worldwide, including in emerging markets. We aim to take advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence in these markets. We intend to achieve this by strengthening our relationships with drinks producers and consolidating our presence and infrastructure in the relevant countries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The screwcap market has also demonstrated a higher resiliency to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the overall closures market, showing a strong rebound in 2021 to date, which we expect will continue, and an expected growth at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% between 2021 and 2024. We believe that aluminum winecaps today account for approximately 23% of all bottled wine worldwide and we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth in this industry, especially as large regions such as North America and Europe move towards greater usage of aluminum winecaps. We believe we are one of the top producers of aluminum winecap closures, with a market share by volume of units sold in 2019 of approximately 30%. We expect growth in the wine closures market to continue due to increasing end-consumer preference for aluminum closures rather than cork. We believe that our leading position in this market means we are well placed to benefit from this growth. We aim to take advantage of this trend by sustaining or increasing our presence this end-market, by strengthening our relationships with wine producers, particularly those which are also active in the spirits market, by developing new and aesthetically attractive closures, including closures with safety elements and innovative features, and by consolidating our operations in the countries and regions where wine closures are purchased in large volumes. 135 ----- According to a study that we commissioned from a global management company, the market for closures for bottled water, measured by closures unit, grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% between 2015 and 2019, and is expected to grow further a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6% between 2021 and 2024, mainly driven by growth in population and increased shift towards healthier beverages. In particular, the premium market for glass water bottles is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7% over the same timeframe. We believe we are currently recognized as a key closure producer in the premium market for glass water bottles, particularly following our acquisition of Closurelogic, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, in 2020. Going forward, we intend to take advantage of these strong growth trends in the glass-bottle closures market by leveraging our core business technology in metal screw caps for spirit closures as well as our expertise in tamper-evident systems.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In doing so we have increased the number of geographical markets in which we operate (for example, we established our presence in Australia, Bulgaria, France, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany and Turkey) and expanded our presence in new segments and the types of products which we offer. Most recently, in 2018, we acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a long-standing presence in the Scottish market, and in 2020, we acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specialising in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary. In the same year, we also acquired a minority stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd., an innovative technology services agency based in London focusing on integrating hardware and software into connected packaging solutions. In the first quarter of 2021, we increased our stake in SharpEnd Partnership Ltd. from 20% to 30%. We believe that we have been successful at identifying and integrating acquired companies and at exploiting the synergies offered by such acquisitions. Going forward, we intend to continue to identify appropriate expansion opportunities where we consider it would help us grow in new geographical markets with high levels of alcohol consumption that we view as underpenetrated including, for example, South Africa and certain countries in Asia. In addition, we intend to continue to identify appropriate acquisitions and other development opportunities that would allow us to consolidate our position in the market for aluminum and plastics closures, and diversify our business through the expansion in the market for closures made of alternative materials such as cork as well as in adjacent product markets, such as food and beverages, including water, beauty and the pharmaceutical industries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

To further improve the efficiency of our production processes, we aim to (i) modernize and automate our production processes on a wide-scale through our flexible automation project, including for small and medium-sized product batches, which we believe will enable us to respond promptly to evolving market needs; (ii) continue to advance our production processes by implementing systems to monitor and improve our entire production cycles (the “continuous improvement” program) and our multi-injection project aimed at eliminating the assembly stage of the manufacturing process; and (iii) hedge part of the risks of price fluctuation in the purchase price of aluminum through forward purchases on the London Metal Exchange through the use of hedging depending on the commodity price environment.

Early in our development we adopted an international focus, initially by licensing our products to local producers and later by establishing a direct presence in the markets we targeted. Over the last two decades, we have expanded our product lines and geographic markets through both organic growth and acquisitions. Prior to the 2018 Business Combination, our expansion has included the commencement in 2015 of production operations in Chile, the acquisition in 2016 of 70% of CapMetal SAS in France (since renamed Guala Closures France SAS), a company specialized in the production of aluminum screwcaps, and the acquisitions in 2017 of Axiom, a leading Indian company active in the production of safety closures for spirits, of the activities of Limat S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company specialized in the manufacturing of wood overcaps for top-range spirit bottles, and of the screw cap activities of Industria Corchera S.A. (“ICSA”) in Chile. On July 31, 2018, pre-merger Guala, was acquired by Space4, a special purpose acquisition company and it merged by incorporation into Space4 on August 6, 2018 with the resulting entity concurrently adopting Guala’s corporate name, Guala Closures S.p.A., and transferring its registered office to Guala’s registered office, Via Rana 12, 15122, Alessandria, Spinetta Marengo, Italy. On the same date, our ordinary shares and Market Warrants were admitted to and started trading on the Star segment of the Italian Stock Exchange (Mercato Telematico Azioniario) and in September 2019, we were admitted to the FTSE Italy Mid Cap index. Following our admission to trading on the Italian Stock Exchange, we continued the expansion of our product lines and geographic reach. In 2018, we acquired Guala Closures UCP, a Scottish company with a long-standing presence in the Scottish market, which supplies closures to some landmark scotch whisky brands. In 2019, we started our operations in Africa following the inauguration of Guala Closures East Africa’s new facility in Kenya and opened a new facility in Belarus. In 2020, we acquired Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water sector, as well as its Turkish subsidiary.

The Closures division represents our core business and produces a wide range of closures for diversified end-markets. The PET division mainly produces standard and custom moulds, PET bottle and miniatures. Our Closures division represents our core business, which is specialized in the following product lines: Safety closures, Luxury closures, Roll-on closures and Roll-on for wine closures. Safety and Luxury closures are specialty closures. In 2019, we reorganized our business structure to focus on our Closures division. We sold part of the Spanish assets of our PET division to third parties and transferred the remaining PET assets from Spain to the United Kingdom. As a result, we no longer consider the PET division a core business. The PET division is now closely connected to the Closures division as customers in the spirit sector are the same and because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory market related to the sale of closures to our customers. As a result of this reorganization, sales generated in our Closures division and from sales of PET products accounted for 99.5% and 0.5% of our net revenue, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2019, following the partial divestment of our PET division and the sale of GCL Pharma S.r.l., which operated our pharma product line, we changed the presentation of our segmentation by product. In particular, we no longer consider it a core business of the Group and no longer report our PET revenues separately. For reporting purposes, we include revenues from sales of products manufactured by our PET division, together with residual revenues not in included in any of the other product lines, under the residual category “Other”. The following table shows the distribution of our net revenue by product line for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We are the world’s leading producer of safety closures for spirits, with a market share by volume of units sold worldwide in 2019 of more than 60%. Safety closures are primarily made of plastics and have a complex structure that generally consist of two to 12 different components. Our safety closures are designed to prevent our competitors from imitating our closures and their unique components. The features of our safety closures products can include tamper-evident seals, non-refillable valve systems, positive lock systems and aluminum cladding. Safety closures are primarily used by our customers when selling their products in emerging markets, where the risk of counterfeiting is higher. We have been active in the production of safety closures since the 1970s when we launched the famous 1031 model safety closure. Most of our older patents related to the creation of innovative solutions for tamper-evident and tamper proofing features in closures with these features being implemented alongside new designs of plastic components and the interaction of plastic components with aluminum shells. Our more recent patent applications take advantage of new technologies, in an innovative manner and for the first time in the closures field, include production cost savings and sustainable methods (for waste reduction) as well as improvements in the efficiency of tamper-evident and anti-counterfeiting measures. 138 ----- Safety closures are increasingly being used as a marketing tool to create a premium brand image through exclusive packaging.

We focus on aesthetic appeal and design and use advanced decoration techniques, including 3D embossing and metal sputtering, to customize closures. These closures are designed to give a more distinctive character to our customers’ brands and to improve the aesthetic appeal of their end-products. Luxury closures can be designed to suit different brand and market requirements. Our leadership in the Safety and Roll-on closures segments facilitated our penetration in the Luxury closures market, particularly because often the customers of these closures are the same and we have been able to leverage our long-standing relationships with their procurement, technical and marketing representatives for Safety and Roll-on closures, who are typically also responsible of Luxury closures. Our luxury closures collection includes: - Gravitas, closures made of a new patented material that brings together the versatility of plastic and luxury feel of metal material; - Essence, customized closures made of high quality natural wood; - Icon, closures which feature a combination of materials and technologies that gives closures a touchable appearance; - Torq, closures which combine the retention properties of a screw thread with the premium feel of a cork; and - Opéra, closures made of eccentric materials with a noble and contemporary touch.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Luxury closures product line generated net revenue of €29.7 million and €29.3 million, representing 5.2% and 5.2%, respectively, of our net revenue for the relevant period. _Roll-on closures_ We produce roll-on closures for spirits, mineral water, vegetable oil and condiments sectors (such as those for olive oil and vinegar). We believe that we are the largest producer of standard aluminum closures in Europe. Our roll-on closures also include closures for bottles of soft drinks and beer. Our Roll-on closures portfolio ranges from the simplest screwcaps to more customized solutions decorated with advanced techniques, such as lithography, hot-foil, relief or bas-relief punching. Roll-on closures are primarily made out of aluminum and can typically comprise up to four different components. Our products comprise (i) long and short aluminum closures fitted with a thread enabling them to be screwed directly onto the neck of the bottle and (ii) aluminum closures with plastic components enabling special functions, such as anti-drop spouts (mainly designed for olive oil bottles) or flow inhibitors (mainly designed for vinegar bottles). We seek to, where appropriate, migrate customers from Roll-on closures to higher margin Safety closures through a process of customer education and product innovation. 141 ----- The table below sets out certain information for the principal closures in our Roll-on closures product line.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Roll-on closures product line generated net revenue of €201.0 million and €196.4 million, representing 35.1% and 34.8%, respectively, of our net revenue for the relevant period. _Roll-on for wine closures_ Aluminum screwcap closures specifically dedicated to the wine sector are easy to open and convenient to store as well as lower cost than traditional cork closures. Screwcap closures for wine offer further advantage to natural and synthetic corks for bottled wine as screwcaps are not susceptible to natural cork taint issues and, therefore, do not create a risk of spoiling the wine contained in the bottle. Demand for aluminum screwcaps closures for wine has increased in recent years, and in 2020 aluminum screwcap closures were used on approximately 23% of all bottled wine worldwide. Flat coated and printed aluminum sheets are pressed to produce the closure shell, which is then finished to meet the customer’s needs through the use of printing machines. Our Roll-on wine closures product line includes a range of product and technological features, including decoration, concealed threading, tamper-evident band, pressure retention and varying levels of permeability including by use of controlled OTR liners. Our key Roll-on for wine closures include the Liners by Oneoseal[®], which we started developing together with Manufacture Generale de Joints in 2015, including: - Onyx, liners equipped with an aluminum layer to ensure maximum impermeability to oxygen; - Ivory, liners that enable the amount of free sulfur dioxide (SO2) to be reduced when bottling; and - Coral, liners that reduce evaporation of wines with high tannin. The market for aluminum screwcaps for wine closures continues to grow strongly as a result of the superior performance of aluminum closures compared to traditional cork closures. The market growth has been driven by wine producers in New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa, which preferred aluminum screwcaps over cork ones for various reasons, including practicality of use and cost benefits, and is expected to be driven in the future by greater use of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures in Europe, the U.S. and Latin America, where we perceive significant potential for further growth. During the years, we expanded our presence in the wine closures market through a series of acquisitions, including Global Cap in 2003, Auscap in Australia in 2007, 70% of DGS in Poland in 2011, MCG in South Africa in 2012 and 70% of CapMetal SAS (since renamed Guala Closures France SAS) in France in 2016. In 2015, we commenced production operations in Chile, bolstered with our acquisition in 2017 of the screw cap activities of ICSA in Chile. More recently, in February 2020, we expanded our production of wine closures in Europe through the acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH, a German manufacturer specialising in aluminum closures mainly intended for the glass-bottle beverage and mineral water. We believe that we are the leading producer of aluminum screwcaps for wine closures, with approximately 30% market share by volume of units sold in 2019. 142 ----- The table below sets out certain information for the principal closures in our Roll-on for wine product line.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our Roll-on for wine product line generated net revenue of €115.9 million and €117.1 million, representing 20.3% and 20.8%, respectively, of our net revenue for the relevant period. _Other_ Other includes PET products (such as bottles, jars, and miniature flasks for drinks, containers for cosmetics, beauty products, pharmaceuticals and food products), non-core sales (i.e., the sale of aluminum scrap) and other residual amounts not included in the foregoing product lines. From the year ended December 31, 2020, our PET revenues are included in Other revenue as our PET division is no longer considered a core business of the Group following the its partial divestment in 2019. Our PET products comprise the custom molding line, which manufactures bottles, moldings, jars, flasks and miniature bottles, with capacities ranging from 20 milliliters to a maximum of 5 liters, and with bottle neck diameters ranging from 18 mm to 110 mm. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, Other generated net revenue amounting to €21.6 million and €19.4 million, representing 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, of our net revenue for the relevant period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Through technological innovation, we offer spirits makers solutions that increasingly prevent counterfeiting while meeting their needs for premiumization and differentiation. 143 ----- In the spirits end-market, we primarily sell safety, luxury and roll-on aluminum closures to some of the most prestigious multinational producers of spirits (such as Bacardi, Brown Forman, Campari, Diageo and Pernod Ricard). We also sell our products to a number of important regional producers in many of the countries in which we operate (such as state distilleries in Colombia, large whisky producers in India, and vodka producers in Russia). In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the spirits end-market represented 61.0% of our net revenue for the period. _Wine_ With screw-on aluminum closures, wine is more stable over time and its balance is not compromised during transport. Our caps are designed to facilitate opening and closing the bottle and feature liners that limit the oxygenation of the wine so the wine retains its quality and flavour for a longer period of time. In the wine end-market, we primarily sell roll-on aluminum closures to wine producers. The principal customers of our wine closures are major wine producers (such as Accolade, Castel, Caviro and Torres, Concha y Toro, Constellations Brands, Pernod Ricard and Treasury wines) as well as a number of important regional players (such as Casella in New Zealand, Distell in South Africa and The Wine Group in the United States). In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the wine end-market represented 20.8% of our net revenue for the period. _Water and beverages_ We produce aluminum closures for carbonated and still beverages in glass bottles, fruit juice and non-alcoholic beverages. We supply some of the top international brands with generic closures or tamperevident closures that feature capsules based on a patented system to show when a bottle has been opened. In the water and beverages end-market, we primarily sell roll-on aluminum closures to producers of mineral water, such as Ferrarelle, Nestlé Waters and San Benedetto. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the water and beverages end-market represented 10.6% of our net revenue for the period. _Olive oil and condiments_ We offer the oil sector a varied range of long and short capsules, spouts specifically designed for the viscosity of oil, and non-drip devices to prevent dripping at the end of the pour. In the oil and condiments end-market, we primarily sell roll-on aluminum closures to producers of olive oil, such as Carapelli, Deoleo, Unilever and Farchioni group, and vinegar, such as the Ponti group. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in the olive oil and condiments end-market represented 2.5% of our net revenue for the period. _Other markets_ We also sell our products to customers in a broad range of other end-markets, including the pharmaceutical market for PET products. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, net revenue generated in other end-market represented 5.1% of our net revenue for the period. We have had relationships with many of our customers for over 30 years. Our top five closures customers the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 were (in alphabetical order) Bacardi, Casa Cuervo, Diageo-USL, Pernod Ricard and Vinventions Deutschland. Together, they represented approximately 30.4% of our net revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Certain of our customers own multiple brands. However, no single brand represented more than 3% of our 2020 net revenue as we provide products to multiple brands of several global manufacturers.

The broad selection of our closures and our significant diversification means that we face competition from different global and local competitors, which we believe are made up as follows: - non-specialized main competitors, who produce spirits and wine closures on a global scale, without particular specialization in any product; - specialized main competitors, or medium-sized competitors highly specialized, among others, in spirits or wine closures; - non-specialized competitors, who produce packaging on a global scale, with limited market share for spirits and wine closures; and - small, local manufacturers. Our competitive advantages compared to other peers in the closures market include: - our ability to satisfy our customers’ requests, particularly in the spirits market where customers tend to use one manufacturer per product; - our ability to meet specific requests from the market, especially in the safety and luxury market; and - pricing, in particular in the markets of roll-on closures and wine closures. 145 ----- We believe that, as of December 31, 2019, we held a global market share by volume of the safety closures manufactured for spirits of more than 60%. We estimate that in 2020, our market shares for Safety and Roll-on for wine closures was six and four times greater than that of our nearest competitor, respectively.

The main focus of our research and development activities is on the development and delivery of products that address the quality requirements and design preferences of our customers, by identifying and implementing technical solutions that are more likely to result in innovative and sustainable products, which in turn we expect will boost demand for our products. We also concentrate on standardizing functional components and on developing processes that reduce our operating costs. We currently operate five research and development centers, consisting of our main center, located in in Spinetta Marengo (Alessandria), Italy, as well as four additional centers located in Luxembourg (Foetz), Mexico (San José Iturbide), Ukraine (Sumy) and the United Kingdom (Kirkintilloch). These centres work in collaboration with all of our department and plants. Our research and development center in Italy comprises workshops and dedicated laboratories, collaborates on a regular basis with specialized external research centers, such as universities and private laboratories, and coordinates the operations of our other research centers in Scotland, Mexico, Ukraine and Luxembourg. Our research and development structure consists of engineers, product and mold designers, and product and project managers. As of December 31, 2020, our research and development centers employed a staff of 51 people. Our research and development team continuously seeks to identify new market trends and translate them into smart, sustainable and valuable solutions. Our traditional market is undergoing a period of profound change with customers looking for cost reductions and pushing some brands to the premium level while looking for higher value packaging. Demand for customized, highly technological and sustainable solutions is increasing from both large and established luxury brands and smaller producers, who typically have tighter budgets. In addition, new generations are shifting consumption of alcoholic beverages to craft products, which need to convey their origin in package messaging, as well as wellness and ethical products. Among our most recent innovations, we offer a wide range of e-closures that enable consumers to confirm the authenticity of products and receive other product information through direct engagement with sellers of products. In particular, we developed e-closures with fully integrated NFC capacity, allowing the end customer to connect with the relevant brand and track and trace their products in connection with combatting possible counterfeiting and product tampering. In the spring of 2017, in partnership with NXP Semiconductors, we presented the industry’s first fully integrated NFC tamper-evident closure solution for the wine and spirits industry, part of our new “Internet-of-Closures” smart family products. In addition, starting from 2018, we developed a new series of e-closures with NFC capabilities under the brand NeˇSTGATE[™]. This technology has revolutionized conventional bottle packaging by integrating connectivity features into bottle closures for spirits, wine, olive oil and beverages. In particular, these e-closures are equipped with a special microchip inside the capsule that is readable by all compatible smartphones, without downloading any specific application, providing consumers with the certification of authenticity and unlocking all information about the product, directly linking them to the brand, thus 146 ----- boosting loyalty. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures include the first wine bottles with e-closures equipped with NFC technology in Europe, which we launched in 2020 together with Vigneti Massa, a well-established winemaker located in the Tortonesi Hills in Piedmont, Italy. We developed this e-closure in collaboration with Compellio, a Luxembourg-based software company. End-customers can take advantage of the technology embedded in these e-closures by creating their own virtual cellar hosted on Compellio’s online platform and receive information on the wine growing areas, the vineyards, the vine, the tasting notes and expert reviews. Customers can also verify the certification of the authenticity of the product using blockchain technology that unequivocally identifies each bottle. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] closures are connected to a blockchain platform which provides a unique identification code for each bottle. This allows Vigneti Massa to protect sensitive product data and monitor them in real time, providing effective support for the traceability of bottles along the supply chain. In 2020, we also launched new NeˇSTGATE[™] e-closures for Irish whiskey Jameson. Our NeˇSTGATE[™] product range also comprises various QR code-based as well as more basic serial number-based models for wine and beverages. Most recently, we designed an electronic tamper-evident closure equipped with proximity sensors capable of detecting nearby objects in partnership with NXP Semiconductors, which we plan to launch in the coming months. In order to refresh our current product portfolio and meet the increasing demand for customized products, our research and development team is currently developing a new series of products tailored for individual brands and equipped with innovative technological and sustainable solutions and with a sophisticated design, which we expect to launch between 2021 and 2023. The laboratory analysis and design of a new model usually takes between four and seven months. The time required for industrialization and production is on average between six and 18 months, depending to a large extent on the technical complexity of the particular product. During the last three years, we have launched over 35 new products. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the costs for research and development activities amounted to €3.1 million, of which €0.7 million was capitalized during the year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

To achieve such result, we adopted a rigorous environmental policy across all of our facilities focused primarily on (i) research, development and improvement of our products and production processes based on products’ life cycles; (ii) engagement of all our stakeholders, particularly across our supply chain, to meet sustainability objectives; and (iii) implementation of specific and measurable actions for the protection of the environment. Based on our environmental policy, we developed a comprehensive strategy to optimize sustainability across our operations and we identified a series of sustainability targets that we intend to achieve. Among our key objectives, we intend to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per ton of finished product from our baseline in 2016 by optimizing processes and investing in new equipment for plants as well as optimizing loads and logistics across our supply chain. In addition, we intend to further reduce our energy consumption per ton of finished products. Other key sustainability targets include the reduction of 147 ----- total waste per ton of finished products and of hazardous waste and waste sent to landfill, the reduction of water withdrawal per ton of finished products by 28%, which we have already achieved in 2020, and obtain of the ISO 14001 certification on environmental management for all our facilities. We also intend to increase the overall share of all recycled materials (including both aluminum and plastics) used in our packaging products, which was 27% in 2020. As part of our sustainability plan to increase the use of energy from renewable sources, we launched dedicated programs at some of our plants. In 2020, our plants in Auckland, Sao Paulo, Magenta, Termoli and Olerdola transitioned (fully or at least in part) to electricity produced from renewable sources. In particular, our facility in New Zealand received a full year’s supply of electrical energy from renewable sources in 2020. The Spanish facility in Olerdola began receiving electricity supply entirely from renewable sources in January 2020. In addition, since 2018, the Brazilian facility in São Paulo has received an annual supply of energy from renewable sources covering 100% of consumption. In 2020, we also signed an agreement with an Italian energy supplier to cover the entire electricity consumption of our Magenta and Termoli plants with the supply of electrical energy from renewable sources. In order to make our production process more efficient, improve quality of our products, reduce waste and increase energy and water savings, in the three months ended March 31, 2021, we implemented Iris, a new software developed entirely in-house, at our Spinetta Marengo facility in Italy. This software, which is able to connect 150 machines simultaneously, performs data analysis and makes recommendations to the facility’s operator on how to improve product quality, reduce waste and increase energy and water savings in line with our key sustainability principles. Going forward, we plan to implement the new software at our Termoli and Magenta facilities in Italy, as well as at all of our other facilities worldwide. The efficiency of production processes is key to achieving customer and investor satisfaction and we intend to increase our Overall Equipment Effectiveness (“OEE”), the indicator that measures the total efficiency of plants and equipment, which is calculated as the ratio of output and saturated input, and highlights inefficiencies related to organization, maintenance, production and quality. Our OEE was 76.3% in 2020. We also aim to reduce our average production scrap rate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We strive to ensure a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees across all of our facilities worldwide. With plants and offices in 25 countries and customers from over 100 countries, we place great importance on diversity and inclusion as well as talent recruitment and management. In 2020, we adopted a dedicated charter of diversity and inclusion, which we applied to all our plants, to ensure equal opportunities and treatment, strengthen our multiculturalism and inclusiveness and to maintain and bolster a sense of belonging. The percentage of women holding leadership positions (i.e., managers) increased from 15.8% as of December 31, 2018 to 20.0% as of March 31, 2021. Following the appointment of the new board of directors on April 30, 2021, 44% of the members of our board of directors are women. We endeavor to safeguard the health and safety of our employees through our “zero accident” strategy, which aims at reducing the frequency rates of work-related injuries. Our accident frequency rate (number of incidents per million hours worked) has been decreasing consistently over time and in 2020, we recorded 63 incidents, compared to 88 in 2019, with a decrease in the frequency rate of 22.8%, from 7.71 to 5.95. The rate of accident severity (days of absence per incident per thousand hours worked) also decreased by approximately 40% from 0.30 to 0.18 from 2019 to 2020. Overall, we place a great importance on our corporate social responsibility and our public image and endeavor to apply the highest ethical and legal standards when shaping our strategic goals and in our daily business activities. We strive to incorporate ethical and social responsibility principles in our internal guidelines and procedures. In addition, we give our employees extensive opportunities to develop their skills and talents and offer various training courses on their work and job security and we promote the environmental awareness of the people who work for us through training courses. In addition, we work to support the countries in which we operate and seek to give back to local communities through impactful community projects to support the developing countries in which we operate (including India, Colombia and Mexico), including through various reforestation projects to offset our Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions which we started in 2011. We also offset carbon dioxide through reforestation projects in collaboration with international NGOs and the purchase of carbon credits (i.e., 148 ----- certificates equivalent to one ton of CO2 per certificate, not emitted or absorbed as the result of an environmental protection project aimed at reducing or reabsorbing global emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases). We developed these projects with influential partners and independent international certified agencies that audited our activities. By the end of 2020, we have planted over 390,000 trees and involved more than 6,500 people in the various projects across the developing countries in which we operate. Examples of other projects to support local communities in the countries in which we operate, include the distribution of “dignity kits”, which include sanitary towels, undergarments and training on menstrual education to teenage girls across Kenya, and the development and sponsorship of environmental education to thousands of students in India.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Our products and customers are the top priorities of our ESG and sustainability strategy, and this is reflected in our focus on product innovation and design. In order to provide a range of harmonized sustainable packaging solutions, we have developed specific guidelines for eco-design which we have adopted at our five research and development centers in September 2020. Our eco-design guidelines are based on four defined design templates: (i) design to _reduce, based on reducing raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products, which decreases the_ overall impact of our operations on the environment; (ii) design to change, based on increasing the use of recycled materials in our products, including aluminum and certain types of polymers as well as wood; (iii) design to fade, focused on eliminating waste by using biodegradable polymers; and (iv) design to revive, based on recycling our end-products to reduce scrap pollution and waste. In line with our long-term commitment to design sustainable solutions, in November 2020, we launched a new range of sustainable products under the umbrella brand Blossom[™], which includes products such as Greencap[®], a fully removable and disposable aluminum screwcap made of recycled materials, a luxury T-bar closure fully made of recycled ocean-diverted plastic and agglomerated cork that we developed in collaboration with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, and Spring Blossom, a new aluminum closure for water with a tamper-evident ring produced from completely bio-based polymers. Our research and development team focuses on the studying and prototyping closures made of materials and technical solutions that reduce the environmental impact of packaging over its life cycle, including recycled polymers, biopolymers and composite polymers. To achieve such result, we study and analyze the various phases of a product’s life, from the production of selected raw materials to end-of-life treatment, by using tools developed by us together with selected partners. In 2020, we signed contracts with new suppliers of recycled polymers and carried out plastic moulding tests, especially for the production of PET bottles, one of the few plastic materials that has a specific recycling chain. In December 2020, we signed an exclusivity agreement with Oceanworks[®], the largest global marketplace for sustainable materials, in order to develop a line of T-bar closures manufactured using fully recycled ocean-diverted plastic. Customer satisfaction is a key element of our corporate culture and we strive to provide punctual, effective and high quality customer service. We measure our customer service level by monitoring the “On Time and In Full” or “OTIF” indicator, which considers the percentage of deliveries made on time and in full compared to the total number of shipments made. In 2020, our OTIF reached 89.8% despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We leverage our network of plants to ensure continuity of service to customers, reducing the risk of service disruptions as well as interruptions in the supply of utilities and malfunctions. We also agreed continuity plans with our major customers that include production in alternative plants or the identification of backup warehouses. In addition, we launched projects to reduce the environmental impact of product packaging across several plants (including in Italy, France, Ukraine and Scotland) in order to both replace cardboard boxes with reusable plastic packaging (in collaboration with some important customers) and replace disposable wooden pallets with reusable recycled plastic pallets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.175,Raw materials and suppliers,17.175.1,,"We purchase aluminum in coil and aluminum foil from a number of suppliers which we select based on technical criteria, service quality, reliability and sustainability parameters. Our principal suppliers of aluminum are located in Europe and most of the aluminum we used is produced by the Magenta facility and then allocated to our facilities worldwide. However, our plants in Poland, Ukraine, South Africa, Argentina and Australia purchase part of the aluminum they use from third-party suppliers. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we used a total of 35,481 tons of aluminum. Our aluminum purchase agreements specify quality and performance levels, technical specifications of the product, price breakdowns, total processing costs, delivery plans and payment schedules and minimum purchase quantities for annual consumption. We also purchase aluminum ingots on the spot market, which we then dispatch for processing to suppliers of aluminum coil. In addition, we meet part of our demand of aluminum through a transformation process of aluminum stemming from production waste. In addition, we use more than 43,000 tons per year of different types of plastics. The majority of our purchases of plastic resins are made on the basis of purchase orders from a number of leading European and world producers. While we have a central control of plastic purchase price, raw materials are primarily sourced locally. Our key plastic resins suppliers for our European production facilities are located in Italy, France, Germany and Belgium. The majority of the plastics resins used in production are low and highdensity polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and polycarbonate. Our supply requirements contracts with our principal suppliers set out the terms of payment, delivery schedules and the criteria for determining any price and volume discounts (usually conditional upon us meeting specified purchase targets). Our supply contracts also provide for adjustments of prices depending on periodic increases or 150 ----- decreases in plastic resins prices, which, in turn, change on a weekly basis, except in the case of polycarbonate, the price of which is generally set for periods of several months. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the share of recycled raw materials used in our products was 27% compared to 23% in 2018, and we intend to increase it to 35% by the end of 2025. Raw materials prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Increases in the prices of our raw materials have therefore had a direct impact on our production costs. We are able to manage this by reducing the quantity of aluminum used in our manufacturing process and substituting it with other raw materials. Since most of our closures division sales are made on the basis of contracts that fix our sales prices for the term of each contract (generally one year) or are otherwise made pursuant to purchase orders that do not link sales prices to increases in the cost of raw materials, our closures division margins are exposed to the risk of fluctuations of the prices of raw materials. In order to mitigate our exposure to such risks, we select our suppliers very carefully. We also continually seek to implement innovative product and process solutions aimed at reducing consumption of raw materials. Additionally, in respect of aluminum, we use hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. We typically purchase aluminum based on contracts that set prices by reference to the aluminum quotations on the London Metal Exchange in euro or U.S. dollars, which are converted into euro at the average exchange rate at the month of purchase. We seek to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with aluminum price fluctuations by entering into forward contracts with brokers operating on the London Metal Exchange, whereby we purchase aluminum at a fixed price to protect our operating margins from price volatility. Our forward hedging transactions covered approximately 60% of our aluminum supplies at December 31, 2020. Our forward hedging transactions currently cover approximately 70% of our estimated 2021 aluminum needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Principal factors _affecting our results of operations—Costs for raw materials”. To date we have not entered into similar_ hedging arrangements in respect of plastic price fluctuations, because such arrangements are not currently available in the market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

We first produce each plastic component by using injection molding technology developed by our in-house personnel. Our closures are then customized by applying surface decoration through various techniques, such as off-set, silk screen or tomographic printing, or hot-stamping. Finally, we assemble the plastic safety closure itself and are able to assemble multiple components at high speed. As part of our continuous effort to make our manufacturing process more efficient by leveraging technological innovations, we are implementing a multi-injection project to develop closures made of different plastics in the same mould in order to eliminate the assembly stage of our manufacturing process and provide significant additional anti-counterfeiting protection to our closures. In addition, we focus on wide-scale flexible automation of our productions process, which we plan to implement also for small and medium-sized product batches. The luxury product line uses the same processing techniques as our safety closures product line, but extra attention is paid to aesthetic design. The process may involve “metallization” of the capsule or applying other special finishes, depending on the characteristics of the end-product. The production process of roll-on aluminum closures and screwcaps for wine closures begins with the aluminum coil being washed and cleaned. The sheets are printed and pressed into different shells and aluminum rings. If a customer wishes to have a more aesthetically appealing design or to customize the closure with a particular color or with the company’s trademark, we perform side-printing using off-set and silk-screen techniques. The final stage of the production process is the assembly of the aluminum closure where we insert seals or plastic components such as non-drip spouts or flow inhibitors. Some pharmaceutical closures use rubber which is cut to the correct shape then washed and sterilized. We have warehouses adjacent to almost all the production facilities. Our plastic materials are kept in dedicated silos to avoid jeopardizing the purity of our end-products. Since our finished products are generally shipped directly to customers soon after production, they are stored only for limited periods of time. 151 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In addition, as of March 31, 2021, the majority of our production facilities obtained the ISO 22000:2018 certification for food safety management systems and the 14001 certification for environmental management systems. We intend to obtain these certifications for all of our plants by the end of 2022. In order to offer objective guarantees of compliance with occupational, health and safety, environmental and ethics standards, we have joined the SEDEX (social ethical data exchange) platform with the aim of keeping information on all plants updated, making it transparent to customers and having our plants subject to SMETA audits by third parties. As of March 31, 2021, all of our plants were included in the platform, and in 2020 SMETA audits were carried out at four of our plants, the relevant audit reports were made available to our customers and we are implementing any necessary measures in light of their findings and recommendations. All of our facilities utilize efficient quality control and certification processes for raw materials. We perform regular quality controls on the raw materials that are supplied to us by our suppliers. Our technical staff checks the technical characteristics, including the purity and quality of polymers, their resistance to pressure and shock, their conformity with EU regulations governing packaging materials for food, and their resistance to the effects of alcohol. Moreover, plastics are also tested to ensure that they do not affect the taste of spirits. We operate an advanced quality assurance process to improve the quality performance of all our facilities. Qualified staff at each production facility carry out tests on raw materials, processes and end-products to improve quality and adopt corrective or preventive measures to ensure a high level of efficiency throughout our production chain. These processes include the use of statistical process control and we involve our employees in on-going monitoring activities. We believe that this approach to quality control increases employee participation and provides necessary training at all levels. The staff assigned to this task have an active role in the development and modernization of our production facilities. We monitor the quality of our finished products to ensure that our products fully meet our customers’ requirements and expectations. We believe that our quality assurance practices are critical to improving our internal processes and the service we provide to our customers.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

While in global form, notices to Holders may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of notice via registered mail. Such notice of redemption may instead be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note (or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System) to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.

Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain and provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request, and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each such certified copy or other evidence of such payments a certificate stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy or other evidence was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part (in integral multiples of €1,000 and provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or any part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the 212 ----- Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly, at the cost of the Issuer, mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxembourger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would require the Issuer to make a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources and whether the Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to distribute funds to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the _Notes Guarantees—We may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase_ 213 ----- _your Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—We will depend on payments from other Group companies and in particular its subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

On the 366th day (or the 546th day, if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €20.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be required within ten Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the 229 ----- Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition _Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari_ Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset _Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly_ tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its reasonable discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. 230 ----- The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio- based Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other Indebtedness which is available to be redrawn howsoever described or structured (including under the Revolving Credit Facility or any ancillary facility under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric. If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical _permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower_ permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of a Permitted Acquisition or Permitted Investment (after taking into account any pro forma “run rate” adjustments as a result of such transaction in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture), the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such Permitted Acquisitions and/or Permitted Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission. In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the Issuer may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” classify and reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may at the option of the Issuer be split between different Applicable Metrics). The Indenture will provide that references to (i) any matter being “permitted” under the Indenture or any other Notes Document shall include references to such matters not being prohibited or otherwise being approved under the Indenture or such other Notes Document and (ii) any transaction being in the “ordinary course of business” of a member of the Group shall be construed to include any transaction that is consistent with industry practice in the industries in which the Group operates or consistent with past practice of any member of the Group. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Testing Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”): (i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period (or any such other preceding period as specified in such Applicable Metric) and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry-Forward _Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 50% of the permitted amount in the immediately_ following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry-Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable 243 ----- Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry-Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry-Back Amount. For the purpose of this section and to the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on a pro forma basis) no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken or reported to the Trustee more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any time period providing for the cure of any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default described under the first paragraph of this section may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first paragraph of this section or direction to take (or refrain to take) any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder _Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a_ written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. Any Directing Holder that does not provide a Position Representation with a Noteholder Direction shall be deemed to have voted its interest as a Holder without discretion in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to such matter by Holders who are not Net Short. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant 245 ----- time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction (provided that the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any Agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Net Short position or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and benefits under the Indenture at all times, including without limitation for actions that are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the consent of Holders holding 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the 246 ----- Indenture)) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy, and such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (3) such Holders, or Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation (as applicable), have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such indemnity and/or security; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice or has actual knowledge, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year and is continuing. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default that has occurred and is continuing, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed under “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such provision or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such 247 ----- circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate. “Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any specified Person for any period, the sum, without duplication, of: (1) the Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period; plus (2) all dividends, whether paid or accrued and whether or not in cash, on or in respect of all Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any series of Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, other than dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; plus (3) Fixed Charges that would have arisen from the Reserved Indebtedness Amount had such Reserved Indebtedness Amount been incurred as of the date of its classification as a Reserved Indebtedness Amount. “Group” means the Issuer and its Subsidiaries from time to time. “Group Initiative” means any action or step (including any restructuring, reorganization, new or revised contract, information and technology systems establishment, modernization or modification or the implementation of an operating improvement initiative, efficiency initiative, cost savings initiative, opening and/or development of any facility, site or operation, capacity increases, capacity utilization or any other adjustments or similar initiative) taken, committed or expected (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to be taken by the Group. “Guarantee” means any guarantee (including any Notes Guarantee) or obligation, contingent or otherwise, of any Person directly or indirectly guaranteeing any Indebtedness of any other Person, including any such obligation, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise, of such Person: (1) to purchase or pay (or advance or supply funds for the purchase or payment of) such Indebtedness of such other Person (whether arising by virtue of partnership arrangements, or by agreements to keep-well, to purchase assets, goods, securities or services, to take-or-pay or to maintain financial statement conditions or otherwise); or (2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness of the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or in part), provided, however, that the term “Guarantee” will not include endorsements for collection or deposit in the ordinary course of business.

Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

For these purposes, securities similar to bonds (titoli similari alle obbligazioni) are securities that incorporate an unconditional obligation for the Issuer to actually pay, at maturity, an amount not lower than their nominal/face value/principal (“valore nominale”) and that do not provide any right of direct or indirect participation in, or control on, the management of the Issuer or of the business in connection with which they are issued. 300 ----- Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest relating to Notes issued by the Issuer that qualify as obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni are subject to a tax, referred to as imposta sostitutiva (as defined below), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or when payment thereof is obtained by the holder on a sale of the Notes) where an Italian resident holder of Notes is the beneficial owner of such Notes, and is: (d) an individual holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial; or (e) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice or similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities or a professional association; or (f) a private or public entity (other than a company) or a trust not carrying out commercial activities (other than an Italian undertaking for collective investment); or (g) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation; in any case, unless the Italian resident noteholder has entrusted the management of the financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized intermediary and has validly opted for the application of the so-called risparmio gestito regime (the “Asset Management Option”) pursuant to Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended (“Decree No. 461”). All the above categories are classed as “net recipients.” Where the resident holders of the Notes described in (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional income tax. In such a case, Interest deriving from the Notes is subject to Italian ordinary income taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be deducted from the income taxation due by the taxpayer. Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016, as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Finance Act 2017”), Article 1 (211-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Finance Act 2019”), or Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124 of October 26, 2019, converted into Law No. 157 of December 19, 2019, as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Law Decree No. 124”). Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the 26% imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, società di intermediazione mobiliare (so-called “SIMs”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio, stockbrokers and other qualified entities, identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance, which are resident in Italy (“Intermediaries” and each an “Intermediary”) or by permanent establishments in Italy of banks or intermediaries resident outside Italy or by organizations or companies non-resident in Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance (which includes Euroclear and Clearstream) having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239. For the purposes of applying imposta sostitutiva, Intermediaries or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries are required to act in connection with the collection of Interest or, in the transfer or disposal of Notes, including in their capacity as transferees. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. Payments of Interest in respect of Notes issued by the Issuer that fall within the definitions set out above are not subject to the 26% imposta sostitutiva if made to beneficial owners who are: (a) Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected; (b) Italian resident partnerships carrying out commercial activities (società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice); (c) Italian resident open-ended or closed-ended collective investment funds, investment companies with fixed capital (SICAFs) or investment companies with variable capital (SICAVs) established 301 ----- in Italy, Italian resident pension funds referred to in Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005 (“Decree No. 252”), Italian resident real estate investment funds and Italian real estate closed-ended investment companies (“RE SICAFs”); and (d) Italian residents holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial activity who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorized financial intermediary and have validly opted for the Asset Management Option. Such categories are classed as “gross recipients”. To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of the 26% imposta sostitutiva, gross recipients must deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes in due time directly or indirectly with an Italian authorized financial Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary). Where the Notes and the relevant coupons are not deposited with an authorized Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary), imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld: (a) by any Italian bank or any Italian intermediary paying Interest to the holders of the Notes, (b) by the Issuer, and (c) gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct any imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due on their taxable income. Interest accrued on the Notes is not subject to imposta sostitutiva and is included in the corporate taxable income (and in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the holders of the Notes, also in the net value of production for purpose of regional tax on productive activities, “IRAP”) of the holders of the Notes who are Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments in Italy or foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected, subject to tax in Italy in accordance with ordinary tax rules provided that the Notes together with the relevant coupons are timely deposited with an Intermediary.

In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt—under certain conditions— for any of the three regimes described below. Under the so-called “tax declaration regime,” which is the standard regime for taxation of capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to the extent that they do not opt for the “risparmio amministrato” regime or the Asset Management Option, the 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains net of any relevant incurred capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities pursuant to all investment transactions carried out during any given tax year. The capital gains realized in a year net of any relevant incurred capital losses must be detailed in the relevant annual tax return to be filed with Italian tax authorities and imposta sostitutiva must be paid on such capital gains by Italian resident individuals together with any balance income tax due for the relevant tax year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. Alternatively, holders of the Notes who are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to which the Notes are connected, may elect to pay imposta sostitutiva separately on capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes (“risparmio _amministrato” regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:_ (a) the Notes being deposited with an Italian qualified intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign intermediary); and (b) an express election for the so called risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in due time by the relevant holder of the Notes. The intermediary is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes, as well as on capital gains realized as at revocation of its mandate, net of any relevant incurred capital losses, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the holder of the Notes, deducting a corresponding amount from proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes. Where a sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, the intermediary is entitled to deduct such loss from gains of the same kind subsequently realized on assets held by the holder of the Notes within the same relationship of deposit in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio _amministrato regime, any realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax_ return of the holders of the Notes. Special rules apply if the holders of the Notes have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary and have exercised the Asset Management Option. In this case, capital gains on the Notes will not be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains. In particular, under the Asset Management Option, any appreciation of the Notes, even if not realized, will contribute to determine the annual accrued appreciation of the managed portfolio, subject to 26% Asset Management Tax. Any depreciation of the managed portfolio accrued at year end may be carried forward against appreciation accrued in each of the four subsequent years. Under the Asset Management Option the realized capital gain is not required to be included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes.

In the case of Notes held by investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs, capital gains on Notes contribute to determine the increase in value of the managed assets of the funds, SICAVs or SICAFs accrued at the end of each tax year. The investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to taxation on such increase, but the Collective Investment Fund Substitute Tax will apply, in certain circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders. Any capital gains realized by a holders of the Notes that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005), will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% Pension Fund Tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes).

Where a holder of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a RE SICAF, to which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as subsequently amended, apply, capital gains realized will be subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the hands of the real estate investment fund or the RE SICAF.

Any capital gains realized by Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are connected or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, will be included in their business income (and, in certain cases, may also be included in the taxable net value of production for IRAP purposes), subject to tax in Italy according to the relevant ordinary tax rules. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ The 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains may in certain circumstances be payable on any capital gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident individuals and corporations without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However any capital gains realized by non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected through the sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes are exempt from taxation in Italy to the extent that the Notes are listed on a regulated market in Italy or abroad, and in certain cases subject to timely filing of required documentation (in the form of a declaration (autocertificazione) of non-residence in Italy) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty. Where the Notes are not listed on a regulated market in Italy or abroad: (a) Pursuant to the provisions of Decree No. 461, non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected are exempt from imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of the Notes if they are resident for tax purposes in a White List State. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they timely file with the authorized financial 305 ----- intermediary an appropriate declaration (autocertificazione) stating that they meet the requirement indicated above. The same exemption applies in case the beneficial owners of the Notes are (i) international entities or organizations established in accordance with international agreements ratified by Italy; (ii) certain foreign institutional investors established in White List States; or (iii) Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. (b) In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double taxation treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon sale or redemption of Notes are to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of the recipient, will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or redemption of Notes. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the _risparmio amministrato regime, exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that_ they timely file with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a statement from the competent tax authorities of the country of residence of the non-Italian residents.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation will be applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after June 26, 2017. Insolvency proceedings opened before June 26, 2017 will be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation will apply to insolvency proceedings opened in respect of a company whose center of main interests is located in a Member State (other than Denmark). _Main insolvency proceedings_ Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “center of main interests” (“COMI”) is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States (other than Denmark) may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), paragraph 2, provides for a rebuttable presumption, whereby in the case of a company it is assumed that its center of main interests is in the jurisdiction of the place of its registered office. In order to prevent fraudulent or abusive forum shopping, such presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request of the opening of insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the presumption shall not apply and the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company will be the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the company had its registered office before moving it. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. This means that a company’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a company has its COMI depends on the facts and circumstances as at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. If the “center of main interests” of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast EU 314 ----- Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Preamble 10, Annex A has been extended to include insolvency proceedings previously not falling within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation (such as, with respect to Italian insolvency proceedings, accordi di ristrutturazione, procedure di composizione della _crisi da sovraindebitamento del consumatore and liquidazione dei beni) in order to promote the rescue of_ economically viable but financially distressed businesses. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize (subject to any public policy exception) the judgment of the court commencing main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. _Secondary insolvency proceedings_ Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member States. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. However, under Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law and from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceeding was opened in the Member State were the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvent estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Those exceptions include certain “safe harbors” which disapply the lex fori _concursus of the relevant proceedings in respect of certain acts and rights. For example, rights in rem_ (which include the rights of creditors to take enforcement action against, and dispose of, the assets of the company which is subject to the relevant insolvency proceedings) may not be affected by the company’s lex fori concursus and are instead subject to the governing laws which apply to the relevant arrangement under which the creditor obtains such rights. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. 315 ----- _Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_ The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them. _Effects of the European Directive 2019/1023 on restructuring and insolvency_ On July 16, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (“EU Restructuring Directive”) entered into force. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States concerning preventive restructurings and insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all Member States on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum harmonization) but, at the same time, leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of several features. The Member States are required to pass national laws to implement the EU Restructuring Directive (except for certain provisions which may be implemented at a later stage) by July 17, 2021.

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for down-stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross-stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Ministerial Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. _Financial assistance_ In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to 317 ----- support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interest of the company. _Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the Italian guarantor. It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void. _Limitations to the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_ In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that the Italian guarantor and/or the security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Italian guarantor and/or security provider under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the Italian guarantor’s or the security provider’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee and/or security interests will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or such Italian guarantor and/or security provider may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee or security interests. As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, corporate benefit and financial assistance, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement: (a) a Notes Guarantee and security interest granted by a Italian guarantor and/or a security provider shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans made available from time to time to the Italian guarantor or security provider (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly), in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or the security provider; provided further that the Italian guarantor and/or the security provider shall not be liable as a Italian guarantor and/ or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that the Italian guarantor or the security provider is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by the Italian guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or security provider; (b) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Italian guarantor or the security provider, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes; (c) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Italian guarantor or the security provider will be at any time equal to the amount of interest accrued in relation to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Italian guarantor and/or security provider at that time; (d) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the obligations of a Italian guarantor and of a security provider 318 ----- under its Notes Guarantee and/or any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or the security provider shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, respectively; and (e) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to financial assistance (including article 2358 and/ or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of any Italian guarantor and of a security provider under its Notes Guarantee and/or any security interests granted by the Italian guarantor or the security provider shall not include and shall not extend (directly or indirectly) to: any obligation of any obligor, as principal debtor or guarantor (for principal, interest and/or any other amount), in respect of any amount the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of such Italian guarantor or security provider (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or the subscription of any shares or quota of such Italian guarantor or security provider (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) (or to refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such purposes) including any related costs and expenses. In any case, the maximum amount that the Italian guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Italian guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the Collateral granted by the Italian guarantor (if any) will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by the Italian guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by the Italian guarantor (if any), the obligations of the Italian guarantor as Italian guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security obligations of the Italian guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the Italian guarantor’s credit support as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of such guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes, as applicable, will be able to recover limited amounts under the Guarantees and security interests. _Trust_ The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of 319 ----- enforcement are not secured by the security under the Transaction Security Documents and/or that the _rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the_ holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is only granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/ or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee”, since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its individual capacity acting in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of the Notes, becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. However, the parallel debt procedure included in the Intercreditor Agreement, according to which the security interests is also granted in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations against the Issuer, which will be discharged to the extent the corresponding principal payment obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Notes are discharged, has not been tested in Italian courts, and there is no assurance that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Italian law, therefore, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, in no event will the “parallel debt” provisions apply to any Transaction Security Document governed by Italian law. _Italian Usury Laws_ If at any time the Issuer would be liable for the payment of remuneration of principal (including the rate of interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs, but excluding tax costs) resulting in a breach of Italian law on usury (Law No. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended from time to time) and any related implementing regulations, then the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the remuneration of principal shall be limited to the payment of remuneration of principal which is permitted under Italian law on usury and any related implementing regulations. Indeed, Article 1815 of the Italian civil code provides that if the remuneration exceeds the maximum rates permitted under the Italian law on usury, no remuneration is due to the creditor. _Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_ Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. 320 ----- As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes, as applicable. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes, as applicable to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. _Certain limitations on enforcement_ The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application when public companies are involved. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. To this extent, it shall be noted that Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian Government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 containing the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions",144.3.2,,"in an insolvency scenario, see “—Bankruptcy (fallimento)” above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; 321 ----- - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione _necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_ Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del _diritto);_ - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; 322 ----- - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Among such legislative measures, on April 8, 2020, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree, which provides businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with a package of financial assistance designed to help Italian businesses survive the dramatic short term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which has been converted into law on June 4, 2020. 336 ----- The Liquidity Decree (as amended, supplemented and replaced, as the case may be, from time to time) contains measures to relieve enterprises from certain obligations or procedures that could trigger adverse effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions. Most of such measures were in place in the course of 2020 and no longer apply in 2021. However, some other measures are still currently in place and shall therefore be considered. One set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/ pre-insolvency scenarios. These measures provide, inter alia, that the rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on December 31, 2020. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree subsequently replaced by Article 1, par. 266 of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.4,"Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency",144.4.2,,"matters (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019, No. 38—Suppl. Ordinario No. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) the adoption of definition of debtor’s COMI (Centre of Main Interest) as provided for in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020. Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the 323 ----- Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (“Liquidity Decree”), converted into law on June 5, 2020 No. 40. Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as in force before. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. In light of the foregoing, and for the sake of clarity, the following paragraphs will only focus on the Italian insolvency laws and regulations already applicable and into force as of the date hereof (and will not take into account, therefore, the provisions of the Insolvency Code which will enter into force beginning on September 1, 2021). Moreover, by way of a decree dated as of April 22, 2021, the Italian Minister of Justice, Ms. Marta Cartabia, appointed a panel of experts for the purposes of working on possible additional amendments to the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency including in relation to, inter alia (i) a possible additional postponement of the date of entry into force of certain provisions of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency; (ii) possible adjustments in light of EU Insolvency Directive (EU) 2019/1023; (iii) the current and persisting COVID-19 pandemic emergency. According to the above-mentioned decree of the Minister of Justice, the panel of experts shall revert with its proposal of amendments by June 10, 2021. In addition to the above, it should be noted that the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian Government on the Italian Bankruptcy Law are: (i) the reform approved on June 27, 2015 through a law-decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”), which entered into force in June 27, 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by the Italian Law No. 132/2015 effective August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) (“Law 132”); and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016 (converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016) and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/ or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary, status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) and for insolvent companies. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. 324 ----- _Out-of-court restructuring plans (Piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento _attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of_ their financial condition. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth, among the others, by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable; however, it is arguable that they may be adopted to liquidate and dismiss the business of the company and they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court restructuring plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or the security interests created as implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions: (i) are not subject to bankruptcy claw-back action; and (ii) are exempted from potential application of certain criminal sanctions (pursuant to Article 217-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the restructuring plan is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent bankruptcy, if the competent court were to assess that the restructuring plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within a 120-day term from: (a) the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debt. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, to the court by the debtor while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file and opposition to the agreement and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. 325 ----- Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to the proceeding for the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt-restructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law already pending as of February 23, 2020, that the debtor which has already been granted such extension by the court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable grounds (concreti e giustificati motivi). The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the Companies’ Register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication in the Companies’ Register. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced certain new provisions easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors with respect to the debt restructuring agreements. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that (a) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (b) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, third paragraph, letter (d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-participating financial creditors have legal status and economic interest similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it within 30 days of receipt of the application. In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors the performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. 326 ----- Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing and unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of the Supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement. Same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount but unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur new pre-deductible indebtedness subject to authorization by the court and if an expert certifies that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem securities (“garanzie reali”), provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares the aim of the new financial indebtedness results in a better satisfaction of the creditors; and (iii) pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile) and urgent indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. Such authorization request can also be filed in relation to the maintaining short-term facilities (linee di credito autoliquidanti) already in place as of the filing date. _Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published in the company’s register by the registry of the court. From the date of such publication to the 327 ----- date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose claims arose before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for, inter alia: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds (giustificati motivi) for such extension. Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to concordato preventivo proceedings already pending as of February 23, 2020, that the debtor which has already been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The Court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable grounds (concreti e giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by creditors referred to in respect of concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called _concordato in bianco)._ The debtor company cannot file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the 328 ----- activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the _concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) and new super senior indebtedness_ authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) pursuant to Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as supersenior (so called pre-deducibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo proposal may provide, inter alia, that (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the plan and the petition for the concordato _preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the_ continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the disposal of those assets that are not functional to the continuation of the business. The concordato _preventivo plan and proposal may also provide for, inter alia, a proposed tax settlement for the partial or_ deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice _delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls_ a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non _compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above_ provision (for example, employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be treated as a receivable preceding the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of: (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, also by (b) the majority of the classes. The 329 ----- pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via e-mail) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have not exercised their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holders of the Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of the concordato preventivo unless and, to the extent, they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza _obbligatorie) when their accession is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in_ article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and when, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in article 161, third paragraph of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to the liquidation alternative. Article 163 paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure the recovery of at least: (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going_ concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a prebankruptcy composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including the power to take all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court opens a competitive bidding process. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato _preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order._ If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines for the fulfillment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di 330 ----- _ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. Moreover,_ Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree also provides for: (i) upon certain circumstances, the possibility to request a deadline to the Court in order to file a new plan and new proposal to creditors, in order to supersede the previous ones; (ii) in relation to petition for a concordato preventivo and/or a debt restructuring agreement under article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law filed up until December 31, 2021, the right of the debtor to file, within December 31, 2021, a deed of renunciation (atto di rinuncia) whereby it declares that it has prepared and published in the competent companies’ register a reorganization plan under article 67, third paragraph of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and provides evidence of the publication thereof. _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed when a debtor is insolvent by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. - under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce the security interests granted in relation to their claims as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditor’s committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; and - any act (including payments, pledges and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor (other than those made through the receiver) after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the declaration of bankruptcy, becomes (or could become, if made before), ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the Court to give the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) a deadline of no more than 60 days scheduled; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the bankruptcy receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative 331 ----- of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of the debtor’s assets is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare) Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes) and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. According to Article 124, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part., to the extent that the plan provides for the satisfaction in proportion to that which is possible in the event of winding-up, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption (causa di _prelazione) exists, indicated in the sworn report of a professional meeting the requirements set_ out in art. 67, third paragraph, letter d) designated by the court. The treatment established for each class may not have the effect of altering the order of the legitimate causes of pre-emption (cause di prelazione). The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - Statutory priorities The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). In particular, Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre-deductible” (i.e. super senior) claims (including, inter alia claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, 332 ----- but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori _pignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (creditori chirografari). The law creates a hierarchy of_ claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - Avoidance powers in insolvency Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to either one year or six months in (noting that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures in relation to certain transactions, the claw-back period, can be extended to five and three years respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner. (a) Acts ineffective by operation of law (i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. (b) Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner (i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the above referenced Italian Royal Decree and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (I) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (II) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor, in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; (III) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and (IV) pledges and mortgages, granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. (ii) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the 333 ----- bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent: (I) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and (II) granting of security interest simultaneously created for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. (iii) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (I) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (II) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; (III) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (IV) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (V) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of a sanctioned “concordato preventivo ” or a sanctioned “accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti”;_ (VI) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; (VII) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria _ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor_ may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale—“family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action also can be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser. _Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure”. To be eligible, 334 ----- companies must be insolvent, although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—an administrative phase and a judicial phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. If the Disposal Plan is approved, the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions according to the avoidance provisions set forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such as those that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among companies belonging to the same group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years. _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of 23 December 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure”. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt. The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can also initiate claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the creditors. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, 335 ----- insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Interim financing_ The Decree 83/2015, as amended and converted into law by Law 132/2015, by means of the already described Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. _Hardening period/claw-back and fraudulent transfer_ Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant Guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and the Notes Guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such Guarantor under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law as described above. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the Italian Guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Transaction Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Transaction Security Documents. In certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective in accordance with the claw-back provisions set forth in the Italian Civil Code as described above. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Bankruptcy (fallimento)” In addition, as noted above, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.5,Australia,144.5.1,,"The Notes will be guaranteed by Guala Closures Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and Guala Closures Australia Pty Ltd, each being a company incorporated under the laws of Australia (together, the “Australian Guarantors”). The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will also be secured by registered security interests (together, the “Australian Collateral”) over the share capital of each of the Australian Guarantors. _Secured transactions law_ Australian Secured Transactions Law was substantially rewritten in early 2012, with the coming into operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (the “PPSA”). The PPSA introduced a new national register of security interests in Australia, as well as a system of priority and other provisions which affect most types of collateral (other than land). Under the PPSA, a security interest will only be fully effective if it is properly documented and perfected. If it is not perfected, the secured party will be exposed to various risks including that its security interest could rank behind other security interests in a priority dispute, be extinguished entirely (for example, if the grantor transfers the collateral to another person) or could “vest” upon the administration or liquidation of the grantor company, which has the effect of avoiding the security interest. The most common method of perfecting a security interest is by registering a financing statement on the Personal Property Securities Register (the “PPS Register”). Security interests can also be perfected, for some types of collateral, by possession or control. If a security interest that is provided for by a Transaction Security Document is to be perfected only by registration, the Security Agent will need to register a financing statement on the PPS Register within 20 business days after that Transaction Security Document comes into force, otherwise the security interest will be void if the grantor enters into voluntary administration or liquidation within six months (noting that this will not be the case if the grantor enters into other forms of insolvency proceedings, such as a receivership or a creditors’ scheme of arrangement). A security interest will not necessarily defeat other security interests just because it was perfected first. For example, a security interest that is perfected by control will usually have priority over all other security interests, even ones which were perfected (for example, by registration) earlier. The PPSA also gives a super priority to purchase money security interests (“PMSI”). In most cases, a PMSI will have priority over other security interests even if the other security interests were perfected first (unless the other security interest is perfected by control). If a security interest is over “circulating assets” (such as funds in bank accounts (other than term deposits), inventory, most accounts (for example, many receivables) and negotiable instruments), then it may also rank behind some statutorily preferred claims (such as employee entitlements and the costs and expenses of certain insolvency proceedings including an administrator of the grantor company) in an insolvency proceeding. 337 ----- The ability to enforce the Australian Collateral may be constrained by Chapter 4 of the PPSA. The enforceability of the Australian Collateral may also be subject to general law and statutory duties, obligations and limitations. For example: - an Australian Guarantor may be able to redeem the corresponding secured property by tender of payment in full of the obligations secured, at any time before the property is sold; - the secured party may need to exercise its power of sale in good faith and in a manner that is not reckless, harsh or unconscionable, and will need to take reasonable care to sell the property for its market value or, if it does not have a market value, the best price that is reasonably obtainable; - if the secured party is in possession of the secured property, it may need to account to the corresponding Australian Guarantor for any excess, over the secured money, of rents and profits received; - the Australian Collateral may be set aside in respect of any secured property which is confiscated by a Government Agency under laws relating to the proceeds of criminal activities, however this is not likely to occur unless the security interest is itself derived from criminal activity; - the exercise of a power of sale under the Australian Collateral may be subject to notice provisions and other requirements imposed by statute in the relevant jurisdiction where the collateral; - a court may grant relief against the consequences of default if the default is subsequently remedied or an undertaking to remedy it is given to the court; and - the document may not be admissible in evidence before a court if any necessary stamp duty has not been paid. The ability of a secured party to enforce the Australian Collateral may be affected if the relevant Australian Guarantor enters into administration, particularly if the security granted by the Australian Guarantor is not over all or substantially all of its property (including for this purpose all PPSA retention of title property as defined in section 51F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Corporations Act”). The ability of a secured party to enforce the Australian Collateral may also by affected by the operation of the ipso facto regime which applies to certain categories of contracts, agreements, arrangements entered into, and to certain categories of rights arising, on or after 1 July 2018, in accordance with sections 415D, 434J, 451E and 454N of the Corporations Act (as applicable) by way of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Act 2017 (Cth) (“Ipso Facto Regime”) (see further below). _Notes Guarantees and Australian Collateral_ The validity, enforceability and efficacy of the Notes Guarantee and the Australian Collateral (security) to be granted by each of the Australian Guarantors will be affected in various circumstances under Australian law, notwithstanding that the Notes Guarantees are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York, including, without limitation, if: - in granting a Notes Guarantee or security, the directors of the Australian Guarantors did not exercise their powers in good faith in the best interests, and for the benefit, of the relevant Guarantor; - the granting of a Notes Guarantee or security breaches section 260A of the Corporations Act, which prohibits the giving of financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of shares in an Australian company or one of its holding companies, subject to a limited number of statutory exceptions, including where shareholder approval for the financial assistance transaction has been obtained. When a company giving financial assistance has an ultimate Australian registered holding company, whether listed or not, immediately after the relevant acquisition occurs, shareholder approval will also be required from that company; - any payment or proposed payment under the Notes Guarantee or security would breach laws and regulations in Australia which prohibit or restrict transactions with persons and entities considered to be associated with terrorism and payments to, or transactions in relation to, a person or entity against whom the Commonwealth of Australia has imposed economic, political or other international sanctions; and - the Notes Guarantee or security can be voided, or payments made under the guarantee can be recovered, on the application to Court by a liquidator of the company (see below). Enforcement may also be limited by statutes of limitation or by general law doctrines or statutory relief in relation to such matters as fraud, misrepresentation, duress, or unconscionable conduct, frustration, estoppel, waiver or penalties. 338 ----- For the reasons that follow, if the entry into the Notes Guarantees or the Australian Collateral constitutes a voidable transaction under Part 5.7B of the Corporations Act, noteholders could be required to disgorge payments made by the Australian Guarantors in an insolvency proceeding. A liquidator is able to challenge certain transactions into which the company has entered. In particular, the Corporations Act empowers a liquidator to apply to court to void an “uncommercial transaction” (as defined below) entered into at a time when the company was insolvent, or an uncommercial transaction which causes (whether wholly or in connection with other factors) the company to become insolvent, which uncommercial transaction was entered into: (i) within the preceding two years; (ii) within the preceding four years if the transaction involved a related entity of the company; or (iii) within the preceding ten years if the purpose of the transaction was to defeat, delay or interfere with the rights of creditors on a winding-up of the company. Uncommercial transactions are those which a reasonable person in the company’s position would not have entered into having regard to any relevant matter, including the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction, the detriment to the company of doing so and the benefits to other parties of entering into the transaction. In addition, a liquidator is able to challenge a transaction (including payments made under a guarantee or the granting of a security) entered into at a time when the company was insolvent (or which causes, whether wholly or in connection with other factors, the company to become insolvent) which results in a creditor receiving from the company in respect of an unsecured debt more than the creditor would receive from the company if the transaction was set aside and the creditor was to prove for the debt in the winding-up of the company, and the transaction was entered into: (i) within the preceding six months; (ii) within the preceding four years if the transaction involved a related entity of the company; and (iii) within the preceding ten years if the purpose of the transaction was to defeat, delay or interfere with the rights of creditors on a winding-up of the company. Further, upon liquidation, a circulating security interest, being a security interest that attaches to circulating assets (as to which, see above), that was granted within six months of the commencement of the liquidation, is void against the liquidator, except so far as the security secures, among other things, (A) advances of new money to the grantor company, (B) a liability under a guarantee or other obligation undertaken at or after the time of the grant of security on behalf of or for the benefit of the grantor company, or (C) an amount payable for new property or services provided to the company. This arises under section 588FJ of the Corporations Act. The matter of what constitutes the grant of security on behalf of or for the benefit of the company granting the security, for the purposes of this provision, was considered in the case Cuthbertson & Richards Sawmills Pty Ltd v Thomas (1999) 30 ACSR 504. Section 588FJ does not apply where the grantor company was solvent immediately after the grant of the security. Where a liquidator successfully challenges a transaction such as a guarantee and avoids that transaction, then this can prevent the enforcement of the security interest and any money paid or received under that transaction can become the subject of a court order for repayment. _Insolvency Proceedings_ There are four principal corporate insolvency processes in Australia: administration (sometimes referred to as voluntary administration); deed of company arrangement; liquidation (winding-up); and receivership. In addition, there is a fifth, lesser-used regime: creditors’ schemes of arrangement. Pursuant to section 435A of the Corporations Act, the object of administration is to maximize the chances of the company or its business continuing in existence or, if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence, is to result in a better return for the company’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding-up of the company. Administration is only intended to last for a short period; however, in practice, the period is typically extended by Court order. For complex matters (including those with cross border elements), extensions of up to, and at times more than, 12 months are not uncommon. During this period, the administrator takes control of the company, assesses its situation and the options available to it, and reports to creditors his or her opinion on which of those options should be followed. The options in question are either liquidation, deed of company arrangement or for the administration to end and for the company to return to the control of its directors. To permit the administrator the opportunity to do this, there is a moratorium on the enforcement of creditors’ claims (including security interests) and actions against the company and its property (subject to certain exceptions, such as where a lender which holds a security interest over the 339 ----- whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets has enforced the security interest before the administration begins or enforces the security interest during the first 13 business days of commencement of the administration). A deed of company arrangement is an agreement binding on the company and its creditors (and sometimes others) in the nature of a compromise. By force of the Corporations Act, the agreement is one which will bind even those unsecured creditors who do not vote in favor of it, provided a simple majority (by both number and value of claims) votes in favor. Creditors holding security interests are not bound by a deed of company arrangement if they do not vote for it, unless the Court orders differently (which is rare). The purpose of a liquidation is to enable the realization of all of a company’s assets and the distribution of the proceeds of sale of those assets among the company’s creditors and (if there is a surplus after paying creditors) members. Generally speaking, to the extent that their security is sufficient, secured creditors stand outside the liquidation and therefore do not have to prove for their debts. They are generally entitled to sell the assets subject to their security or have them sold and to receive the proceeds (subject to the rights of any prior security holders). Receivers are typically appointed by a person to whom the company has granted a security interest. Their appointment and powers are usually governed by the terms of the security agreement under which they are appointed. The receiver’s principal task is to realize the assets subject to the security interest(s) and pay the proceeds to the secured party. Receivership is a regime implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor which appoints the receiver; whereas both administration and liquidation are regimes aimed at securing the best outcome for all the company’s creditors as a body. Where a company grants security over an asset, the proceeds of enforcement must generally be remitted to the secured party. One exception to this is that where assets are subject to a security interest over circulating assets, the receiver must pay or provide for priority payments from their proceeds before accounting to the secured party. Priority payments are those listed in section 433(3) of the Corporations Act and include liabilities in respect of certain insurance policies, auditors’ fees and employees’ wages and superannuation and certain other employee entitlements, and the amount owing to the administrator on account of his or her fees, costs and expenses. In a liquidation scenario, unpaid employee entitlements can be met by the Australian Commonwealth Government in certain circumstances, which is then subrogated to those employees’ rights in the liquidation. A scheme of arrangement is a court-sanctioned arrangement or compromise, proposed by the relevant company and voted on by the creditors or members (or a class or classes of them) (as applicable) of the relevant company (“Scheme Participants”), which binds the company and the Scheme Participants even though a dissentient minority of the Scheme Participants may oppose it. On January 1, 2021, the small business ‘debtor in possession’ restructuring regime was introduced in Australia. The regime is intended to provide eligible Australian incorporated small businesses with access to a ‘debtor in possession’ restructuring process in which a restructuring plan can be proposed to deal with creditor claims. The process is available to companies which meet the eligibility criteria, the most significant of which is that the company’s liabilities are less than AUD$1 million, including secured and related-party debt, but excluding employee entitlements. The Australian Guarantors are highly unlikely to meet the eligibility criteria, noting that the face-value of the Notes alone is well in excess of AUD$1 million. _Ipso Facto Regime_ The Ipso Facto Regime is designed to protect and preserve an affected party’s contractual assets while it undergoes a formal financial restructuring procedure under the Corporations Act. The Ipso Facto Regime provides that the exercise of express rights to terminate, accelerate or otherwise take action under contracts, agreements or arrangements by reason of an affected party: (1) entering into a scheme of arrangement with creditors (or announcing an intention to do so); (2) having a receiver or controller appointed to all or substantially all of its assets; (3) entering into voluntary administration; or, (4) entering into restructuring pursuant to Part 5.3B of the Corporations Act (together, “Restructuring Procedures”) are stayed for the life of the relevant Restructuring Procedure. The Ipso Facto Regime also restricts enforcement rights that arise by reason of the “financial condition” of a party subject to a Restructuring Procedure and the exercise of rights for any reason that is in substance contrary to the matters provided for in the Ipso Facto Regime. Accordingly, the Notes Guarantees and the Australian Collateral will not be able to be enforced for the reason that an Australian Guarantor has entered into a Restructuring Procedure while that Restructuring Procedure remains on foot. However, the stay on the exercise of rights while a Restructuring Procedure is on foot does not apply where the relevant right is exercisable for a reason other than the existence or 340 ----- commencement of a Restructuring Procedure (or related financial condition), such as a payment default. Also note that the Ipso Facto Regime will not operate to restrict the right of a secured party who holds a security interest over all or substantially all of a company’s assets to appoint a receiver or controller.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.6,Mexico,144.6.1,,"_Personal Guarantees under Mexican Law_ Under Mexican law, there are no limitations for Mexican companies to guarantee third-party obligations, including parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent permitted by its corporate by-laws and authorized by its competent corporate bodies if necessary pursuant to its corporate by-laws. Mexican law provides that contractual obligations such as those assumed by the Guarantors of Mexican nationality (each, a “Mexican Guarantor,” and together, “Mexican Guarantors”) are considered to be ancillary obligations (obligaciones accesorias) to the principal obligations that they secure and therefore the same may only exist to the extent that the obligations of the principal obligor are valid. Therefore, upon a finding of lack of genuineness, validity or enforceability of the obligations of the relevant Issuer under the relevant Notes, the ancillary obligations of the Mexican Guarantors shall be equally affected and in such circumstances the obligations provided for under the Notes might not be enforced in a proceeding before a Mexican court. _Enforcement of Security Interests_ As a general principle under Mexican law, a secured creditor may not take possession of the collateral without court intervention, and if it does so, such action could constitute a criminal offence. Generally speaking, the main right that a security interest provides is the right to request a court to dispose of the asset and apply the proceeds of the sale to payment of the secured obligation up to its outstanding amount. Procedural steps to enforce liens before courts in Mexico depend on the nature of each security interest, and on whether the debtor is in insolvency (concurso mercantil) or bankruptcy (quiebra), or is still doing business. In any event, the procedural approach will vary and the type of action will depend on the documentation held by the creditor. Judgments of non-Mexican courts are enforceable in Mexico provided that a number of conditions are met, including certain basic principles of Mexican due process rules and the non-violation of Mexican law or public policy (orden público). There are no limitations to the election of remedies in Mexico. Creditors can pursue multiple remedies at the same time until the total amount of indebtedness is fully paid. The debtor is entitled to receive any outstanding amount derived from the enforcement and foreclosure of all security interest, once the secured obligations have been paid in full to the creditors. _Certain Mexican Insolvency Law Considerations_ The Notes will be secured by a personal guarantee of the Mexican Guarantors and under Mexico’s _Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, if any Mexican Guarantor participating under this offering is declared_ insolvent, bankrupt or becomes subject to concurso mercantil, such guarantor’s obligations under the Notes would (i) be converted into Mexican pesos and then into an inflation indexed ratio (unidades de inversión) at the date of concurso mercantil court declaration, (ii) cease to accrue interest, and (iii) be subject to certain statutory preferences, including administrative claims, certain tax, social security, labor and secured claims. Payment of debts incurred prior to the judicial declaration of concurso mercantil and foreclosure will be stayed during the reorganization stage. If the personal guarantees of the Mexican Guarantors are granted within three years prior to the date of the concurso mercantil declaration of any Mexican Guarantor, such personal guarantees may be subject to challenges of avoidance within the concurso _mercantil proceeding on the basis of being a gratuitous transaction in which the Mexican Guarantor_ assumed a debt with no legal consideration in return. The principles governing insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in Mexican courts may differ from principles governing insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in other jurisdictions. Therefore, the ability of the holders of the Notes to effectively collect payments due under the Notes may be compromised or subject to delay. In the event that Mexican companies generally cease paying debts when due, they may be declared in _concurso mercantil in accordance with the applicable law in Mexico (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles)._ Under Mexico’s Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, the concurso mercantil proceedings have two consecutive phases: “conciliation” (conciliación) and “liquidation” (quiebra). The purpose of the conciliation phase is to enable the continuation of the Mexican companies’ activities through the execution 341 ----- of a restructuring agreement with their creditors. The purpose of the liquidation phase is to liquidate the business, as a whole or by the sale of operating units or their individual assets, to repay their creditors. Companies may request to proceed to the liquidation phase directly, thereby avoiding the conciliation stage. According to Mexico’s Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, a company can enter concurso mercantil proceedings if it has generally ceased paying debts when due when, is in payment default with respect to two or more creditors, and either (i) requests to be declared in concurso mercantil and meets either of the two conditions described below, or (ii) any of its creditors or the public prosecutor (Ministerio Público) makes a claim for the concurso mercantil declaration of the company and the company meets both of the following conditions: - 35% or more of the company’s outstanding liabilities are 30 days past due as of the date of the filing of the concurso mercantil petition. - The company has insufficient liquid assets and receivables (which are specifically defined) to support at least 80% of its obligations that are due and payable. Two or more companies forming part of the same corporate group (grupo societario) can simultaneously file a petition and be jointly declared in concurso mercantil, without substantive consolidation. A federal court with jurisdiction over the location in which a company maintains its domicile is competent to receive the petition and conduct the concurso mercantil proceeding, except in the case of holding or subsidiary companies, where the competent court will either be the court that is conducting the first proceeding filed or has jurisdiction over the location in which the company maintains its domicile. The judgment declaring a company in concurso mercantil will contain, among other things: (i) an order to suspend the payment of debts incurred prior to the effectiveness date of the judgment, except for those that are essential to the ordinary course of the company’s business, (ii) an order to suspend all writs of attachment or foreclosure during the conciliation stage, with the exceptions set forth in Mexico’s Ley de _Concursos Mercantiles (the court may consider some collateral non-essential for the ordinary course of the_ company’s business, such as some employment claims and secured claims), and (iii) a retroactive date (fecha de retroacción) for purpose of scrutinizing any fraudulent conveyance (such date shall be the date that is 270 days prior to the date of concurso mercantil declaration, and it may be extended up to three years). Upon the declaration of insolvency, all debts of the relevant company are automatically considered due and payable, will cease to accrue interest, and be converted, if they are in foreign currency, into Mexican pesos (if applicable), and then into unidades de inversión, which are inflation indexed reference units, unless the debts are secured loans, which will be preserved in their original currency and continue to accrue the agreed ordinary interest (with no default interest accrual) up to the value of the collateral. Any provision of an agreement that worsens the contractual terms for a debtor pursuant to the filing of a petition or a demand for, or the declaration of, concurso mercantil, shall be deemed not included therein. The conciliation stage lasts 185 calendar days, but the governing bodies of the concurso mercantil or certain specific majorities of creditors may authorize up to two extensions of 90 days each, if they determine that they are close to reaching a restructuring agreement. In no event may the conciliation stage be extended beyond 365 calendar days. If there is no restructuring agreement by this deadline, the liquidation (quiebra) stage begins immediately. Once liquidation is declared, the judge starts with the liquidation of the business, as a whole or by sale of operating units or their individual assets, to pay the creditors’ claims according to their grades. Creditors are ranked in the following order, depending on the nature of their credits: (1) Privileged employment claims (salary and benefits accrued in the previous year and severance); (2) Administrative claims and post-commencement financing; (3) Claims incurred for regular expenses in connection with the security, repair, (4) conservation and management of the estate assets; (5) Claims for judicial or extrajudicial procedures for the benefit of the estate; (6) Burial and terminal illness expenses (of individual debtors only); 342 ----- (7) Secured claims. These claims are paid out of the proceeds of the property that has been collateralized, and generally in the order that the securities have been registered in accordance with applicable law; (8) Any remaining labor and employment claims; (9) Unsecured tax claims; (10) Priority claims, which are those from creditors with a privilege or a retention right (e.g., a mechanics’ lien). These claims are paid out of the proceeds of the retained property and are generally paid in the order of privilege that has been registered in accordance with applicable law or by the date of the claims; and (11) Unsecured claims and Subordinated creditors (including intercompany debt other than that of the parents of the debtor). No payments may be made to any creditor of a certain rank before all of the creditors of a better rank have been paid off.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.7,The Netherlands,144.7.1,,"If a Dutch company grants a guarantee or security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest knew or should have known this without independent investigation, the guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the Dutch company, its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in the corporate interests. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee or security interest, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above ultra vires concepts also apply with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet-toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include the right to suspend performance (opschorting), dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). The enforceability of the obligations of a Dutch company may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. 343 ----- In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. _Parallel Debt_ Under Dutch law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the secured claim but purports to hold security interests for the parties that do. The beneficial holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Transaction Security Documents. In order to permit the Noteholders from time to time to have a secured claim, the Transaction Security Documents or other finance documents will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Dutch law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt structure has not been tested under Dutch law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law. _Fraudulent Transfer_ To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a Dutch legal entity may, under certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors or its administrator or bankruptcy receiver (curator), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the time the guarantee or security interest was granted both the Dutch legal entity and, unless the guarantee or security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also, to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within one year of the granting and for no consideration. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not prevent effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation has a close connection (and for this purpose “overriding provisions” are provisions the respect for which are regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or not) that must be applied pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in 344 ----- which performance takes place in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement of each Dutch law security interest in the Collateral (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch law shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of third parties acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw) may also affect the binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral. In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant security interest provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the secured assets, except when otherwise agreed. In the case of secured assets, the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure once the security right has become enforceable. The security interest providers have agreed to waive the right to request such alternative foreclosure procedure. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the secured assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest provider to request approval of a private sale may be excluded. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created in collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto. It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than in respect of rights of mortgage, if any), except that any security created over the shares in a Dutch company should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any pre-existing security. _Insolvency_ Guala Closures International B.V. is a Guarantor incorporated in the Netherlands (the “Dutch",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.8,Guarantor”). Any insolvency proceedings concerning such Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee would likely be,144.8.1,,"based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in The Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not established under Dutch law. Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the United States or other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the United States or another jurisdiction. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a moratorium of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. This general description is subject to the emergency legislation discussed under “—Administration Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 _Pandemic” below._ An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). The court will also set a date for a meeting of creditors, which is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless (i) a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of 345 ----- creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent or (ii) if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (afkoelingsperiode), a moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a moratorium of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, during a moratorium of payments or bankruptcy under Dutch law secured and (in the case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments or the bankrupt company to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments or bankruptcy. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt company. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt debtor’s assets. Both in a definitive moratorium of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the Noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it is no longer able to pay its debts when due. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to moratorium of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het _Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest_ (openbaar belang). Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. Generally, claims of the Noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a moratorium of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the 346 ----- unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for verification, and that the receiver then determines the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings to the purpose of voting and the distribution of the proceeds. Where interest is accruing after the date of opening of the proceedings, it can be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the Noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a moratorium of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause Noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the Noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As mentioned above, a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured or preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred (which may therefore result in a total period of eight months if the similar “cooling down period” of the execution is first applied during moratorium of payments), unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge (rechter- commissaris). Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. Such set-off is allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy, if (i) it performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration (om niet)) the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In addition, in the case of such a bankruptcy, their trustee may nullify its performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling _ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the_ performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors. Whether or not a Guarantor is insolvent in The Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a security document may be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). 347 ----- Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when a moratorium of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the moratorium of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under Dutch law, bankruptcy and moratorium of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the judgment of the bankruptcy or the moratorium of payments. _Dutch Scheme_ With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet _homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer_ a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is inspired on the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in moratorium of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter _alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned_ proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Dutch Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/ or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes. Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two third of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert. _Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic_ The emergency legislation (the Temporary Covid-19 Social Affairs and Employment and Justice and Security Act (Tijdelijke Wet Covid-19 SZW en JenV)) regarding a temporary suspension of enforcement and other measures in support of enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic entered into force on December 17, 2020. The emergency legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and several related protections which apply until at least August 1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary, be extended beyond that date for two month periods at a time. The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than regulated entities) whose continuity is threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the tax 348 ----- authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/ debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis-à-vis those creditors of two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two month periods at a time). If such moratorium is granted by the court then during such moratorium period: (i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed; (ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with those creditors; and (iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court. The measures referred to in (iii) above can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the court only affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same decisions. When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the moratorium retain these rights vis-à-vis their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.9,Poland,144.9.1,Insolvency (bankruptcy) Proceedings,"DGS will not be a Guarantor of the Notes, however a portion of the entire issued share capital in DGS will be subject to security, and therefore insolvency laws (and other applicable regulations) relevant to the pledgor of the shares in the Polish company must be considered. The sole fact of DGS becoming bankrupt does not affect the security interest granted over its shares, but may materially adversely impact the value of such security. The following is a general description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Poland relating to bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings and how such laws affect the enforcement rights of secured and unsecured creditors. _General_ The insolvency laws of Poland are primarily set out in the Bankruptcy Law dated February 28, 2003 (Prawo upadłos´ciowe) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020, no. 1228, as amended) (the “Polish Insolvency Law”). By default, the courts of Poland have jurisdiction over insolvency proceedings of a company incorporated and registered in Poland and with its center of main interests in Poland. The insolvency laws of Poland and, in particular, the provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law in relation to priority of creditors and the duration of insolvency proceedings may not be as favorable to 349 ----- creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments, to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under the Polish Insolvency Law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require a debtor or creditor to file a petition to commence insolvency proceedings (the “bankruptcy petition”). The debtor is obliged, no later than within thirty days (30) from the day on which the grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy arose, to file a bankruptcy petition with the court. A declaration of bankruptcy should be issued in respect of a debtor that has become insolvent. A debtor is insolvent if: (i) it has lost the ability to perform its due pecuniary obligations (it is presumed that a debtor has lost the ability to perform its due monetary obligations if the delay in payments exceeds three months) or (ii) in the case of a legal entity with legal personality (osobowos´c´ prawna) or a legal entity without legal personality, but which has legal capacity (i.e., the ability to enter into transactions and to be the subject of rights and obligations (zdolnos´c´ prawna)), the debtor’s pecuniary obligations exceed the value of its assets and this situation lasts for more than twenty-four months (although the entity satisfies its monetary liabilities). It is presumed that a debtor’s pecuniary obligations exceed the value of its assets if the balance sheet shows the debtor’s liabilities, exclusive of reserves for liabilities and of liabilities to related entities, exceeding the value of the debtor’s assets and this state of affairs persists for a period in excess of twenty four months). In the latter case, however, the court may refuse to sustain the bankruptcy petition if there is no risk that the entity would cease to perform its monetary obligations in the near future. If the assets of the debtor are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings, the court will dismiss the bankruptcy petition. The court may also dismiss a petition where it has been established that the assets are encumbered by security (such as a mortgage or pledge) to such an extent that the residual assets are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings. However, the court will not order dismissal if it is established that the encumbrances on the debtor’s assets are ineffective under the Polish Insolvency Law, or that they were created to the detriment of creditors, and further, if it is established that the debtor performed other acts, such as disposing of assets sufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings, which can potentially be set aside under the Polish Insolvency Law and, as an additional condition, if the circumstances of the case indicate that by applying the relevant provisions on the ineffectiveness and contesting of the debtor’s acts, assets with a value in excess of the predicted costs will be obtained. If the petition is dismissed, any conservatory measures are called off and the debtor is free to continue its commercial activity. Provisions of any agreement which stipulate that such an agreement will be terminated and/or amended upon bankruptcy (or upon bankruptcy petition being filed) of one of the parties are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt entity is a party which hinder or prevent the objectives of the insolvency proceedings will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate. Any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than Polish złoty, regardless of whether the claim has fallen due or not, if put on the list of claims, must be converted into Polish złoty at the average exchange rate of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) prevailing on the date on which the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy, creditors may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date of the decision of the bankruptcy court on the debtor’s bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any proceeds of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings will be carried out through liquidation of the bankrupt debtor’s assets. In insolvency proceedings, all creditors, whether secured or unsecured, wishing to assert claims against the debtor, need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Polish insolvency proceedings are in principle collective proceedings and creditors are barred from pursuing their individual claims separately. Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the relevant insolvency proceeding (lodging of claims) and will be paid on a pro rata basis out of the bankruptcy estate. Creditors who have a security interest over the debtor’s assets or any part thereof have priority rights under the governing law of the security interest and under the relevant provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law. In essence, secured creditors are not entitled to enforce such security interest outside the relevant insolvency proceeding. Creditors secured by a registered pledge may enforce their security interest directly by way of appropriation of such collateral. 350 ----- _Priority of Creditors in Insolvency Proceedings_ The funds of the bankruptcy estate will include proceeds of the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate, and income earned from running or leasing the bankrupt’s enterprise, as well as interest on bank deposits. Sums obtained from the transfer of assets and rights encumbered with a mortgage or pledge will be allocated to satisfy those creditors whose receivable debts were secured over the transferred assets or rights. The Polish Insolvency Law governs the priority of claims for (i) secured creditors (i.e., creditors whose claims are secured by a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or treasury pledge) and (ii) other creditors. In the latter case, the Polish Insolvency Law provides for four categories of debts, which include a number of preferential debts (such as money owed to employees) and several less-preferential ones (ex. money owed to the shareholder and related to the shareholder’s loan or arising from a similar legal action, which are repaid in the last 4[th] category). In cases where creditors have rights in rem to the sold tangible property or rights, the receiver makes a separate plan to distribute the money earned on the sold tangible property or rights. If the sum allocated for distribution is not sufficient to satisfy all the debts in full, debts of lower categories of priority are satisfied only after the full satisfaction of debts of preceding categories of priority, and when the assets are insufficient to satisfy in full all debts within the same category of priority, then such debts shall be satisfied on a pro rata basis. _Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_ After a debtor is declared bankrupt, the following are recognized as ineffective against the bankruptcy estate, by operation of law: (i) a disposition of the debtor’s assets can be avoided if it was effected in the one year preceding the filing of a petition for the commencement of an insolvency proceeding, if the transaction was gratuitous or for consideration manifestly lower than the consideration received by the debtor; (ii) satisfaction of a debt before its maturity date or the granting of security in respect of such debt, if effected within the period of six months preceding the filing of a petition for the commencement of an insolvency proceeding, and if, at the time of such transaction, the debtor was already insolvent and the creditor had knowledge of it; (iii) a transaction made within the period of six months preceding the filing of a petition for the commencement of an insolvency proceeding where the debtor is a legal person and the other party is its shareholder, representative (or spouse of such person) or affiliated company, or such affiliated company’s shareholder, representative (or spouse of such person) (and noting that the same rule applies if the debtor entered into a transaction with a dominant company). Ineffectiveness is recognized by the judge in charge of the bankruptcy proceedings and shall be determined, ex officio or at the request of the receiver. Security interests granted over a party’s assets in the form of registered pledges or other security interests may be voidable transactions which are capable of being challenged by an administrator of the bankruptcy estate and may be set aside by a judge-commissioner ex officio within two years of a declaration of bankruptcy, if: the party was not personally liable for the debt and such security interest was granted less than one year preceding the date of the bankruptcy petition; if the party did not receive any consideration for the granting of such security interest or the consideration received was disproportionately low in comparison to the value of the security interest granted; or regardless of the value of consideration previously received by the party, security interests were granted to secure debts of companies in the same corporate group. Other actions detrimental to creditors may also be challenged on the basis of the Actio -Pauliana, governed by articles 527 onward of the Polish Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny).",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

A creditor may apply for remedial proceeding (one of the types of the Restructuring Proceedings (please see below)) but only if a debtor is insolvent. The Restructuring Proceedings may be carried out against a debtor who is insolvent and/or at risk of insolvency. An insolvent debtor shall be construed as a debtor who is insolvent in the meaning of the Polish Insolvency Law. A debtor threatened with insolvency shall be construed as a debtor whose economic situation indicates that he may soon become insolvent. The Restructuring Proceedings shall be instituted on the basis of the restructuring application filed by the debtor. The restructuring application shall be construed as an application for the opening of the restructuring proceedings and an application for the approval of the arrangement adopted in the arrangement approval proceedings. The restructuring shall be carried out under the following Restructuring Proceedings: (i) arrangement approval proceedings (poste˛powanie o zatwierdzenie układu), (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone poste˛powanie układowe), (iii) arrangement proceedings (poste˛powanie układowe), (iv) remedial proceedings (poste˛powanie sanacyjne). In the case of filing a restructuring application and a bankruptcy application, the restructuring application shall be examined first. The purpose of the Restructuring Proceedings is to avoid a declaration of bankruptcy of the debtor by enabling him to restructure through an arrangement with creditors and, in the case of remedial proceedings, by carrying out remedial actions, whilst safeguarding the legitimate rights of creditors. The arrangement approval proceedings shall enable the conclusion of the arrangement, where the debtor shall collect the creditors’ votes by himself without involvement of the court and may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement. The accelerated arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after the table of claims under a simplified procedure has been prepared and approved; it may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement. The arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after the table of claims has been prepared and approved and may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement exceeds 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement. Cases in the Restructuring Proceedings shall be examined by a restructuring court. The district court— commercial court shall be the restructuring court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

However, if a motion to register a mortgage or a registered pledge is filed more than six months before the filing of a motion to open Restructuring Proceedings, the mortgage or pledge will be registered. This does not modify the general rule that pre-petition in rem security interests (e.g., mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, security assignment) survive the Restructuring Proceedings and the claims secured by any of these security interests are not affected by the arrangement. However, the arrangement will cover secured claims to the extent that these claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the relevant secured creditor agrees to be covered by the arrangement. Secured creditors consenting to the arrangement may be allocated to a separate class of creditors and be afforded special treatment in the arrangement (i.e., different from unsecured creditors). There is an important exception to this rule in relation to partial arrangements (which are permitted in arrangement approval proceedings and accelerated arrangement proceedings), if the proposed arrangement offers the relevant secured creditor full satisfaction (although on a date specified in the arrangement) or satisfaction in part, but to the extent not lower than that expected in the case of enforcement of security. If this exception applies, the relevant secured claim will be covered by the arrangement irrespective of the creditor’s consent. 352 ----- Certain security will be infective towards the remedial estate (masa sanacyjna), namely: (i) security established by the debtor within one year before the date of filing the application for the opening of remedial proceedings which has not been established directly in connection with the receipt of the performance by the debtor shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate; (ii) security in the part which on the day of the establishment of the security exceeds more than half the value of the secured performance received by the debtor together with claims for incidental performance determined in the document forming the grounds to provide security, established within the year prior to the date of the filing of the application for the opening of remedial proceedings, shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.9,Poland,144.9.4,Security interests—pledges,"Under Polish law, in general, all security interests, including, without limitation, pledges, are considered accessory to the underlying secured claims, i.e., the security interest will automatically terminate if the secured claims are repaid, terminated or become void. The establishment of certain security interests in Poland requires the execution of appropriate documents and often making entries into registers or making filings with the relevant courts. The establishment of a pledge requires the execution of contractual documents (in the form of pledge agreements) and, with respect to registering the pledge, the entry of the pledge in the pledge register held by the relevant Polish court. Also, with respect to the shares in joint-stock companies (spółka akcyjna) it is required to register a pledge in a shareholders register (rejestr akcjonariuszy). The process of registration of a registered pledge usually takes up to two months and, until registration is complete, the registered pledge will not legally exist under Polish law. Once registered, the order of priority of the registered pledges will be determined by the order in which the applications for registration of pledges were submitted to the court. In respect of certain rights, such as rights over shares, over which a registered pledge is to be granted, the payment obligations may also be secured by a “financial pledge”. However, a financial pledge does not grant the same scope of rights to the secured creditors as a registered pledge. A secondary bankruptcy proceeding may be opened in Poland against a pledgor with a seat in country other than Poland. In respect of a registered pledge, the pledgee will have the right to satisfy claims secured by such registered pledge (if so provided by the relevant pledge agreement) through standard court enforcement or through out-of-court methods of enforcement, by assuming title to the pledged assets on the terms set out in the respective pledge agreement or through the sale of such assets in an auction conducted by a notary public or a court enforcement officer, in priority to other creditors. However, if any third-party creditor initiates enforcement proceedings to satisfy their claims in respect of the assets secured by a registered pledge, then the pledgee will not be able to exercise any of the out-of-court methods of enforcement discussed above in relation to such assets, but rather will only be entitled to enforcement of such pledge via a standard court enforcement process, which is usually considered more time-consuming and more expensive for the secured creditor. In the event of enforcement of a pledge over shares in a company organized under the laws of Poland, the Polish regulations in respect of the pledge and the provisions of Polish company law with respect to the transfer of shares have to be adhered to. The security interest granted for the benefit of the pledgee in Poland often includes the grant of both financial pledges and registered pledges over the same assets. The legal validity of the co-existence of registered and financial pledges over the same asset and securing the same claim is untested under Polish law and could be subject to challenge. _The Competition Act (change of control)_ Pursuant to the Polish Competition Act dated February 16, 2007 (Ustawa o ochronie konkurencji i _konsumentów) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2021, item 275), taking_ control over an undertaking by way of, among other things, an acquisition of shares and/or any part of its assets and/or an acquisition of a right to exercise the voting rights under shares held in such an undertaking, may require prior approval of the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (“OCCP”). It follows that, if a pledgee were to enforce a registered pledge by way of acquiring 353 ----- title to the pledged shares or by exercising the voting rights in respect of those shares, it may require prior approval of the OCCP. Violation of the Polish Competition Act may result in fines and/or in case restoring competition it is not feasible otherwise a duty to dispose of the acquired assets / shares or other remedial actions. Please note that such an acquisition may require approval from the European Commission (in such a case approval of the OCCP is not required) and/or the competition authorities of other countries. _Polish Act on Control on Certain Investments_ Pursuant to the Polish Act on Control on Certain Investments dated July 24, 2015 (Ustawa o kontroli _niektórych inwestycji) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020, item 2145)_ Poland has a COVID-19 related foreign investment regime which covers all non-EEA/EU/OECD investors’ (i) acquisitions of 20% or more of voting rights, shares or share in the profits of the Polish companies operating in the sectors considered as sensitive that generated turnover of more than €10 million in Poland, (ii) acquisitions that results in crossing 20% or 40% threshold of respective entitlement (voting rights, shares or share in the profits) or (iii) acquisition or lease from a company operating in a sector considered as sensitive of its enterprise or organized part of its enterprise (the “COVID-19 FI regime”). The COVID-19 FI regime covers a broad scope of acquisitions performed by non-EEA/EU/OECD investors with: (i) pre-closing suspensory approval requirement for direct acquisitions of Polish protected companies; and (ii) post-closing approval requirement in case of indirect acquisitions of Polish protected companies (e.g., when the transaction concerns the acquisition, by a non-Polish entity, of a stake in a Polish protected company, which falls within the COVID-19 FI regime). If the transaction triggers a filing it must be notified to the OCCP and consent must be received before it is carried out. The timing and practicalities of notification (for instance whether a notification should be made pre- or post-closing) will depend on the details of a transaction (e.g., whether transactions concern the direct or indirect acquisition of a protected company). Assuming that DGS is considered as operating in sensitive sector, then if a pledgee, being non-EEA/ EU/OECD entity, were to enforce a registered pledge by way of acquiring title to the pledged shares or by exercising the voting rights in respect of those shares, it may require approval of the OCCP. Failure to notify the acquisition to the President of the OCCP may result in fines, criminal liability as well as, depending on the type of acquisition (direct or indirect), either its voidness or prohibition to exercise rights attached to shares of the Polish company. _Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners_ Under the Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners dated March 24, 1920 (Ustawa _o nabywaniu nieruchomos´ci przez cudzoziemców) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw)_ of 2017, item 2278, as amended) (the “Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners”), the acquisition of ownership or perpetual usufruct right (perpetual usufruct is a local 99-year leasehold title, very close to the ownership) over real estate in Poland or the acquisition of shares in a Polish company being an owner or perpetual usufuctuary of real estate in Poland, or any other action through which such Polish company becomes controlled by a foreign entity, in certain situations requires a permit from the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration (a “MOI Permit”). The Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners provides for a number of exemptions from the duty to obtain a MOI Permit. In particular, such duty is waived in respect of acquisition of shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, acquisition of shares in a company by bank having its registered office in Poland (if related to claims pursued by the bank arising from bank transactions) and to acquisitions made by foreign Shareholders or persons domiciled in countries which are members of the European Economic Area. However, these exemptions are not absolute and they do not apply to certain types of real estate (such as the real properties located within the border zone). Under the Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners an acquisition by the pledgee of shares in a company organized under the laws of Poland in the course of the enforcement of a pledge over such shares may also require a MOI Permit if the pledgee does not have a registered office in a country which is a member of the European Economic Area. 354 ----- _New Act on Agricultural Land_ On April 30, 2016 the Act on Prohibiting the Sale of Real Properties Held in State Treasury Resources and on the Amendment of Certain Other Acts dated April 14, 2016 (Ustawa o wstrzymaniu _sprzedaz˙y nieruchomos´ci Zasobu Własnos´ci Rolnej Skarbu Pan´stwa oraz o zmianie niektórych ustaw) (Journal_ of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2016 item 585) (the “New Act on Agricultural Land”) entered into force. The New Act on Agricultural Land among other provided relevant amendments to the Agricultural System Act dated April 11, 2003 (Ustawa o kształtowaniu ustroju rolnego) (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw) of 2020 item 1665) (the “Act on Agricultural Land”). The Act on Agricultural Land with respect to disposal of shares of a company being an owner or perpetual usufructary of agricultural land of a total area not less than 5 ha (50.000 sq. m.) introduces the following rights of the Agricultural Agency (Krajowy Os´rodek Wsparcia Rolnictwa): - pre-emptive right applicable in the case of shares sale, and - buy-out right applicable in case of disposing of shares in any legal form other than sale. However if the other legal form results in transfer of agricultural land ownership or perpetual usufruct right, the consent of the Agricultural Agency for such transfer will be required.

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not recognize the English law concept of “equity”, there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of security interests. If the strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subjects notwithstanding the intention of the parties. In respect of moveable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which may take different forms) over the security subject(s) in order to create a valid security interest. Scots law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law of equitable assignment, and an interest in Scottish incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties. Fixed security over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard security (which is the Scottish law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land), and this is governed by statute.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors, or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration, there is a moratorium in place, which in general means that no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with the consent of the administrator or with the leave of the court. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt 356 ----- instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral agreement) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court. In addition, a secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver. In order to empower a secured creditor to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge by the relevant Scottish company must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver; or (d) purports to empower the holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint a receiver who on appointment would be an administrative receiver (although this is only permitted under limited circumstances). A secured creditor can appoint an administrator by the out-of-court route, or an administrative receiver (subject to the restrictions noted below), if it holds a qualifying floating charge security, which together (if necessary) with fixed charge security interests and other floating charges, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Scottish company’s property. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant Scottish company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time. Even if the secured creditor holds a qualifying floating charge, it can only appoint an administrative receiver if one of the exceptions to the general prohibition of appointing an administrative receiver applies or the security pre-dates September 15, 2003. The most relevant exception to the prohibition is that a secured creditor can appoint an administrative receiver relating to a “capital market arrangement” (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), which is the case if the issue of the note creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986 as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000 (where the floating charge was created on or after September 15, 2003 but before April 6, 2020) or £800,000 (where the floating charge was created on or after April 6, 2020). The appointment of an administrator ceases to have effect one year from the date of appointment (unless terminated early by the administrator if the administration objectives have been achieved, or where the company is dissolved or put into liquidation, or by the court following application by the administrator or a creditor), but may be extended by up to one year with consent of each secured creditor (and in certain circumstances preferential creditors or unsecured creditors) or by the court for any specified period on application by the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a gratuitous alienation if at the time of or as a result of the transaction, the Scottish company is insolvent. The transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee, or five years in the case of a gratuitous alienation (the English equivalent is a transaction at undervalue) to a connected party if the company makes a gift to a person (save in certain specified circumstances), if the company receives no consideration, or if the company receives consideration of less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if the person seeking to uphold the alienation establishes (i) that immediately or at any other time or after the alienation, the company’s assets were greater than its liabilities, (ii) the alienation was made for adequate consideration; or (iii) the alienation was a birthday, Christmas or other gift for a charitable purpose to a person who is not an associate of the company, which in all circumstances it was reasonable for the company to make (without prejudice to any right or interest acquired in good faith and for value from the recipient of the alienation). If the court determines that the transaction was a gratuitous alienation, the court can grant a reduction or for restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate. In any proceedings, it is for the person seeking to uphold the alleged gratuitous alienation to demonstrate that the Scottish company was solvent (the test for which is set out in clause (i) above). A transaction made at a time when a company is insolvent may also constitute a gratuitous alienation at common law. In these circumstances, no time limits apply in relation to challenging it.

The transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee.

A CVA is a voluntary arrangement, supervised by an insolvency practitioner, that becomes binding on the company and its creditors following approval by 75% by value of the company’s creditors who responded to the invitation to vote (unless those voting against the CVA include more than 50% by value of unconnected creditors). The nature of a CVA proposal is flexible and the compromises and arrangements with creditors that may be proposed vary on a case by case basis. Creditors holding security interests cannot be bound by the terms of a CVA unless they specifically consent. Within 28 days of approval of a CVA, it may be challenged in court by creditors entitled to vote or certain other persons on the grounds of unfair prejudice or material irregularity. A Scheme of Arrangement is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006 whereby a company may make a compromise or arrangement with its members and/or creditors. Like a CVA, the nature of the compromise or arrangement is flexible and not prescribed by legislation. Members and/or creditors are divided into classes based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights and a Scheme of Arrangement must be approved by a majority in number representing 75% in value of the members and/or creditors in each class who vote in person or by proxy. The permission of the court is required to convene the meetings of the members and/or creditors. Where the Scheme of Arrangement is approved by the members and/or creditors, the court must decide whether to sanction this. Where the court does sanction the Scheme of Arrangement, it will be binding on all creditors and members. CIGA 2020 introduces a new Restructuring Plan.

The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, implies that Spain will have two years as of such date to transpose such Directive into the Spanish regulations. This transposition process will probably lead to the approval of certain amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transposition process has not been initiated yet and, therefore, it is still uncertain how this Directive will affect the Spanish Insolvency Act. In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current or imminent insolvency. A debtor is deemed insolvent when it becomes unable to regularly meet its obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency or insolvencia actual) or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (imminent insolvency or insolvencia inminente). The insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by the debtor (“voluntary insolvency” or concurso voluntario), by any of its creditors (provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the filing of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature) or by certain other interested third parties (“compulsory insolvency” or concurso necesario). Notwithstanding, only the debtor is entitled to file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its imminent insolvency. Whether insolvency 361 ----- proceedings are voluntary or compulsory will affect the basis for the insolvency, as well as impact upon the debtor’s capacity. The Spanish Insolvency Act provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor or the liquidation of the debtor. An insolvency proceeding can also conclude: (i) at any moment when it is verified that there are insufficient assets to pay post-insolvency debt; (ii) at any moment when it is verified that all of the credits have been paid, or the situation of the insolvency does no longer exist; or (iii) when it is verified that all of the creditors have waived their credit rights.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.13,Spain,144.13.3,Voluntary Insolvency,"If the debtor requests the insolvency, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency: a situation in which the debtor cannot meet its financial obligations consistently and on time, including obligations not yet due. The debtor is obligated to file a petition for a declaration of insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its state of insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for compulsory insolvency occur. In the event of the debtor failing to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by a bankruptcy authority once the bankruptcy is declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) it may be unable to exercise certain courses of action (including, among others, the possibility of submitting a proposed settlement in advance) and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the declaration of insolvency, should the debtor be liquidated and bankruptcy be classified as “guilty.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support to reach a pre-packaged composition agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado); or an out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de refinanciación) set out in articles 583 et seq. (“notice of negotiation with creditors”) and articles 597 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Effectively, by means of the notice of negotiation with creditors of articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act, the debtor gains an additional three-month period to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement and one further month to file for the declaration of insolvency, if after the above-mentioned period of three months has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of time, creditors’ petitions for mandatory insolvency will not be accepted. During the fourth month period: (i) the debtor has the duty to file for insolvency, unless a pre-arranged composition agreement, a collective out of court workout or an out of court repayment agreement is achieved (i.e. the company would gain four month grace period to file for insolvency by a notice of negotiation with creditors); and (ii) the mandatory petitions could be filed but would not be accepted if the debtor has filed a voluntary insolvency petition (i.e. voluntary case filings have priority over involuntary ones within the fourth month grace period). Likewise, the notice of negotiation with creditors prevents the commencement of court or out-of-court enforcement actions and/or suspends (as applicable) existing enforcement actions, over assets or rights which are necessary for the company’s business operations, other than those arising from public law claims are prohibited, until any of the following circumstances occur: (i) a refinancing agreement set out in Section 598 of the Spanish Insolvency Act is formalized; (ii) a court order is issued (providencia) accepting for processing the court’s confirmation (homologación judicial) of admission of the refinancing agreement; (iii) an out-of-court repayment agreement under article 631 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act is entered into; (iv) the necessary accessions for the admission of a pre-arranged commencement agreement are obtained; or (v) the declaration of insolvency takes place. In addition, enforcement proceedings that have been brought by creditors holding financial claims (pasivos financieros), as defined in article 606 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, shall be prohibited or suspended (as applicable) provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating. Nevertheless secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the corresponding secured assets. However, if these secured assets are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business or professional activity, once proceedings have been initiated they shall be immediately suspended, until three months have elapsed from the date when the notice of negotiation with creditors is filed. Financial securities and security interests over collateral located outside of Spain should not be affected by the notice of negotiation with creditors. 362 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Upon receipt of an insolvency petition by a creditor, the insolvency court may issue provisional interim measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a guarantee from the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective measures. The debtor will be entitled to file an opposition to such petition, and will have to prove that it is not insolvent. The court will then summon the parties to a hearing, and will finally render a court ruling either dismissing the application filed by the creditor, or declaring the insolvency of the debtor. _Effects of the Insolvency for the Debtor_ If the insolvency is voluntary, as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor usually retains its powers to manage and dispose of its business, albeit under supervision by the insolvency receivers (administración concursal) who is appointed by the court (intervention regime). If the insolvency is compulsory, as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, then the debtor is removed from its power over its assets, which become subject to management by the insolvency receivers implying that the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management’s powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely upon the insolvency receivers (suspension regime). These situations may be modified at any time by the competent court. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the insolvency receivers may be declared null and void unless ratified by the insolvency receivers. _Effects of the Insolvency on Contracts_ Under Article 156 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, all clauses that entitle any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency are deemed void. The declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending performance by either the insolvent or the other party, which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. However, the insolvency receivers (together with the bankrupt or by their sole discretion if the bankrupt is not allowed to carry on its business) may request the court to terminate the relevant contract (on the grounds of convenience in the insolvency proceedings (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso), or terminate for breach at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract). The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return consideration received or indemnify its counterparty against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency administrator’s request (assumption) (mantenimiento del _contrato en interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall have claim against the_ insolvency estate (pre-deductible claim from the estate). There are cases in which the Spanish laws expressly allow to establish an agreement for termination in the event of insolvency (e.g., agency laws or RDL 5/2005 (as defined below), applicable to financial collateral, as defined therein). Additionally, bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in _rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in_ favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado). In any event, setoff is prohibited unless the requirements for the setoff were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law that permits set-off. _Effects on enforcement proceedings_ As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court declaration of insolvency (with the exception of certain actions conducted by public authorities that do not 363 ----- concern assets necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor). Additionally, once the insolvency proceeding is declared open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued. The enforcement of any security over certain assets or rights that are necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor may not be commenced and the procedures already initiated before the declaration of insolvency shall be suspended for one year since such declaration, unless an arrangement of a composition agreement is reached, provided it does not affect such right. Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. (a) After such one-year moratorium without liquidation having started, a separated enforcement could be instituted, so long as the secured creditor is not bound by a composition agreement affecting its claim. (b) Enforcement proceedings conducted before other courts or notary publics will be stayed within this one-year period unless the insolvency court declares that the collateral is not necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor. When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about the termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts with such subsidiary allowing the insolvent debtor to exploit such asset. The above regime does not affect financial collateral foreseen under RDL 5/2005 (as defined below), which shall be still enforceable, or where the collateral is located in another EU member state by the time of insolvency declaration. If the collateral is located in a non-EU state by the time of insolvency declaration, the automatic stay (if any) and, in general, the effects of the insolvency will be governed by the insolvency law of the state where the collateral is located. Pursuant to Articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings which can have an effect on the insolvent estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in RDL 5/2005) or collateral located in an EU state other the Spain or, subject to local law, a third state). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law).",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Please also refer to “—Enforcement of Security Interests governed by Spanish law” section below. Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer","There is no automatic claw back by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings but instead the insolvency administrator must expressly challenge those transactions that are considered detrimental (perjudiciales) to the insolvency estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration, even in the absence of fraudulent intent (transactions taking place four years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the ordinary regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code). In addition, creditors who have applied to exercise any claw back action (stating the specific action they aim to contest or revoke and their grounds), shall be entitled to exercise such action if the insolvency 364 ----- administrator does not do so within the two months following their request. The Spanish Insolvency Act does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage”. Damage does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest or on the equality of treatment among creditors. The Spanish Insolvency Act provides that the insolvency receivers may undertake clawback actions against acts that took place before the declaration of insolvency that are considered to be detrimental to the insolvency estate as follows: (a) actions carried out in the two years preceding the declaration of insolvency may be challenged, even in the absence of fraudulent intention; (b) such actions must be considered to be detrimental to the insolvency estate, which is presumed in the following cases: - without admission proof to contrary: (i) actions of disposal for no consideration, exception for ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso); or (ii) regarding payments or other actions cancelling obligations falling due after the declaration of insolvency (unless they were secured); or - with admission of proof to the contrary: (i) in actions for valuable consideration carried out for any party especially related to the debtor, (ii) granting of in rem security covering preexisting debts or new debts incurred to cancel preexisting debts; or (iii) cancellation of secured obligations falling due after the declaration of insolvency. Otherwise, the damage must be proved by the person seeking rescission; (a) under no circumstances can (i) actions carried out in the debtor’s ordinary course of professional or entrepreneurial business and under market conditions, (ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative instruments, and (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of the labor authorities, be rescinded; (b) some kinds of refinancing arrangements (acuerdos de refinanciación) meeting certain legal requirements set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act, as well as the security created in connection therewith, may not be rescinded; and (c) where the party who benefits from the act detrimental to the insolvency estate proves that such act is subject to the law of another State that does not allow its challenge in any case, the act will not be set aside. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to article 16 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, and article 730 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to claw back actions if such act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e., not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non-Spanish applicable laws. Procedurally, there is no safe harbor against a lawsuit being filed and creditors being served to appear before Spanish courts, but the lawsuit should be dismissed on the merits if creditors prove (i) that the act or transaction at issue is subject to foreign law and (ii) that such act or transaction is unavoidable under the circumstances pursuant to that foreign law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

As stated above, a company is insolvent when it cannot regularly meet its payment obligations as they fall due. Notwithstanding the above, creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors (declaración conjunta de concursos) if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same group. Any of the insolvent debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural consolidation of insolvency proceedings already declared (acumulación de concursus) under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among 365 ----- them, or (b) they form part of the same group of companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator pursuant to article 41 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in coordination, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be subordinated). The current system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, and for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is a confusion of states and assets and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be identified, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay. In any event, set-off is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent is governed by a law that permits set-off. _Rules on Priority of Creditors_ Under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the ranking of claims determines the order of payment of credits. The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Boletín _Oficial del Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original_ documentation that justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims benefiting from special privileges; (ii) claims benefiting from general privileges; (iii) ordinary claims; and (iv) subordinated claims. As for secured claims (those secured with in rem security interests) the Spanish Insolvency Act gives them the status of creditors with special privilege, because the law includes in such category those in which the collateral is comprised of specific property or rights (mortgage, pledge or antichresis) or equivalent rights (financial lease agreement for the leased property). Certain limited exceptions may, however, exist to this general rule (e.g., restrictions in article 271 of the Spanish Insolvency Act regarding pledges over future credit rights). An in rem secured creditor is secured (for the purposes of insolvency) for the value of the asset subject of the security (and such value will be calculated taking into account the rules set forth under the Spanish Insolvency Act in order to determine its “reasonable value”) and will be deemed to be unsecured (or ordinary) for the rest. Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) are paid pro rata once the estate claims and both generally and specially privileged claims have been paid. Subordinated claims is a category of claims which includes, among others: credits communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating to unpaid interest claims (including default interest), except for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security interest; fines; and claims of creditors which are “specially related parties” to the insolvent debtor. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors. They do not have voting rights on the composition agreement (as described below) but are subject to its terms, being paid once ordinary claims are satisfied pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Thus, subordinated creditors have limited chances of collecting payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act. As an exception to the subordination regime, new financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a refinancing agreement regulated under articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, which also contemplates a capitalization of credit rights before the granting of new financing, shall not be classified as a subordinated claim under Article 281 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, provided that the requirements set out in Article 283 of the Spanish Insolvency Law are met. This is an incentive to promote refinancing and capitalization of credit rights. Moreover, as a consequence of the of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Act 3/2020, of September 18 (in force as of September 20, 2020) has enhanced the position of certain “specially related parties” in order to solve situations of lack of liquidity. Accordingly, in insolvency proceedings declared on or before March 14, 2022: (i) financing granted by specially related parties; or (ii) financing in which they 366 ----- have been subrogated as creditors because of due payment (e.g., as a result of the enforcement of a personal guarantee, resulting in a claim of the guarantor vis-à-vis the debtor) would not be subordinated, but rather considered ordinary or privileged credit claims. _Limitations to Enforcement by an Unsecured and Secured Creditor_ As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court declaration of insolvency. Unsecured creditors cannot initiate any enforcement proceedings against the debtor company’s assets after the declaration of insolvency. Notwithstanding the rules on priority mentioned in “—Rules on Priority of Creditors” above, in the event of the debtor’s insolvency and in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act, the ability of a secured creditor to enforce the collateral is limited if such collateral is considered necessary for the debtor to continue its professional or business activities. In such a case, the Spanish Insolvency Act imposes a moratorium on, the enforcement of secured creditors’ rights in the event of insolvency, the enforcement of security may not be commenced until (i) a composition is approved (the content of which does not affect this right) or (ii) one year elapses from the insolvency declaration without liquidation taking place. Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the asset is not considered necessary for the debtor to continue its professional or business activities. When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets or rights. Pursuant to the Spanish Insolvency Act, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and the creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). Finally, enforcement of the security will be subject to the provisions of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (as defined below) and the Spanish Insolvency Act (where applicable) and this may entail delays in the enforcement. _Settlement or composition agreement_ Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Act encourages creditors to reach an agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. This agreement may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors whose credits exceed a fifth of all claims (masa pasiva), and it shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, this agreement must be honoured by the debtor and respected by the creditors. The settlement or composition should contain proposals for write-offs and stays for a shorter period than 10 years. Article 317 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act provides that it may also contain alternative or complementary proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for Public Law creditors), including conversion of debt into shares, into profit-sharing credits convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets related to the debtor’s business activity to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the settlement. The proposals in the settlement shall include a payment schedule in accordance with article 331 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. In order for a settlement or composition to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met at the creditors’ meeting: (a) In case the composition agreement contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; to stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans over the same period, at least 50% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) have voted in favor of 367 ----- such settlement or composition. Notwithstanding the above, a vote by creditors representing a portion of the unsecured liabilities that is greater than the vote against will suffice when the settlement consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary unsecured claims applying a write off of less than 20%. (b) In case the composition agreement contains stays of between five and ten years; write-offs of more than 50% of the amount of the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans over the same period and any other proposal under article 317 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act, 65% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) should have voted for the settlement or composition. The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not entitled to vote. Although in principle secured creditors are not subject to an approved settlement or composition (unless they have expressly voted in its favor) the effects of an approved composition can be extended to secured and privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition of creditors has been approved by the following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (Public Law creditors, financial creditors or others): (c) In case the composition agreement contains the full payment of the claims within a period not exceeding three years or the immediate payment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write off of less than 20%, a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than five years or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for a period no longer than five years, at least 60% of privileged creditors have voted in favor; and (d) In case the composition agreement contains a write-off of more than 50% of the claim; stays (for a period between five and 10 years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a period between five and 10 years, and any other proposal under article 317 et seq. of the Insolvency Act, at least 75% of privileged creditors have voted in favor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

It operates where a composition is not reached or when it is decided upon by the insolvency court. The insolvent must file a petition for liquidation if, during the period while the settlement is in force, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of such settlement. In such a case, if the debtor does not file a petition for liquidation while the composition agreement is in force, any creditor may file such petition based on article 407.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Therefore, the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits. The insolvency administration will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the insolvency court. The insolvency administration is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it.

Finally, it must be noted that Article 473 of the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as no future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

(c) In addition, certain refinancing agreements (those that have been approved by at least 51% of the financial creditors and meet the criteria under (a) above other than (ii)) may be sanctioned by the court (homologación judicial) and be imposed to certain dissenting creditors: - all those creditors that have a financial claim against the debtor, irrespective of whether they are subject to financial supervision or not; - any other creditors that have voluntarily signed up to the refinancing agreement, with the exception of commercial and public sector creditors; and - secured creditors in certain circumstances (generally, when certain majorities of secured creditors have voted in favor of the refinancing agreement). The majorities required for the courts to sanction a refinancing agreement vary depending on whether the financial liabilities concerned are secured or non-secured and on the effects to be imposed on non-participating or dissenting creditors with the court’s approval. _Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements_ In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements can be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential bankruptcy proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, if (i) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones with longer maturity dates; (ii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions in order to calculate whether the required thresholds are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group a companies, pursuant to certain precedents, the majority arguably refers both individually to each company and to the group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not taken into account-), and when the company has no auditor, by the one appointed for this purpose; and (iv) the agreement is formalized in a public instrument and the documents that validate its content must be attached. Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements will not be subject to the bankruptcy claw-back action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law. As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favourably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. Whether or not the effects beyond those provided by the law 369 ----- or object to homologation, and whether they have standing to object to homologation can be applied to dissenting creditors, is controversial. The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act and (ii) dissenting secured creditors in respect of their secured claims, provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below: (a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos participativos) of term up to five years. Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor. (b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities: (i) stays of payments for up to ten years; (ii) haircuts; (iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or, as default option, (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap; (iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and (v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio pro solute or datio pro solvendo). Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried our an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw back actions where the 370 ----- subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (i.e., it cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption (i.e., it is a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

These regulations include, mainly, Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17 (Real _Decreto-ley 8/2020, de 17 de marzo, de medidas urgentes extraordinarias para hacer frente al impacto económico y social del COVID-19), Royal Decree-Law 16/2020, of April 28 (Real Decreto-ley 16/2020, de 28 de abril, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia), which was repealed by and its relevant provisions incorporated in Act 3/2020,_ and Royal Decree-Law 34/2020 (altogether, the “COVID-19 Regulations”) and which have stayed the obligation to file for insolvency, currently until December 31, 2021 (please note that despite their obligation having been stayed, the directors still have the right to file for insolvency upon current or imminent insolvency and they could be held responsible for worsening the insolvency situation during that period). Among other measures related to debtors which have already filed for insolvency or subject to opened insolvency proceedings or which have entered into composition agreements or refinancing scheme agreements before the enactment of the COVID-19 Regulations, the main measures related to insolvency law introduced by the COVID-19 Regulations summarily include: - Insolvency moratorium: the COVID-19 Regulations entailed the introduction and subsequent extensions of an exemption for directors in relation to their duty to file for insolvency irrespective of whether they have notified the court of the initiation of negotiations for debt restructuring with creditors. - New money provided by specially related persons: the COVID-19 Regulations set forth that as regards insolvency proceedings declared within two years of the declaration of the first state of alarm (estado de alarma) in Spain (i.e. March 14, 2020), new money provided by specially related persons and any claims in which such specially related person is subrogated after such date will have the consideration of ordinary claims, thus not subordinated. - Insolvency proceedings and liquidation plans: the COVID-19 Regulations introduced different measures to accelerate insolvency proceedings. In relation to those insolvency proceedings opened within two years of the declaration of the first state of alarm (estado de alarma) in Spain (i.e. March 14, 2020), challenges against the list of creditors or assets (inventario) will need to be sustained on documentary or expert evidence (prueba pericial). In relation to those insolvency proceedings already opened at the date of declaration of the state of alarm (estado de alarma) or those opened in the following year, and subject to certain exceptions, all auctions shall be out of court auctions (subastas extrajudiciales).

The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance (provided that the parties to the agreement had not specifically provided that certain breaches -no matter how objectively non-material- could give rise to acceleration). To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be considered material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (5 years being the general term established for obligations in personam under article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. In addition, article 1,851 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the original term, although case law has established exceptions where the extension benefits both the debtor and the guarantor). A guarantee such as the guarantee granted by the Spanish Guarantor will be null if the obligations it secures are declared null. The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are less favourable than those applying to the principal debtor. The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; - Spanish public policy (overriding mandatory provisions); - The availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, statute of limitations, undue influence, fraud, duress, abatement and counter-claim; and - The obligations under Guarantees granted by the Spanish Guarantor in the form of a sociedad _anónima shall (i) not extend to any obligation incurred by any company of the Group for the_ purposes of (a) acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of the holding company of such Spanish Guarantor (or, in case of private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), also shares representing the share capital of any entity of its group); or (b) refinancing a previous debt incurred by any company of the Group for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of the holding company of such Spanish Guarantor (or, in case of private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), also shares representing the share capital of any entity of its group), and shall (ii) be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by a Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 (for Spanish public limited companies (sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for the Spanish private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) of the Spanish Companies Act, and, in no case, can any of the Notes Guarantees or security interests given by a Spanish Guarantor secure repayment of the above- mentioned funds. 372 ----- For the purposes of the paragraph above, a reference to a “holding company” of a Spanish Guarantor shall mean the company which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that one company has a dominant influence on another company when any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met or when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish guarantor are also members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such dominant company. In addition, a reference to the “group” of each Spanish guarantor shall mean the group of companies that have in common the same parent company (as this term is described above). In addition, Article 158 the Spanish Companies Act provides that the financial assistance restrictions referred to above in relation to transactions targeting shares of a Spanish parent company shall also be applicable to its non-Spanish subsidiaries carrying out such transactions. In accordance with the abovementioned, the guarantees and security interests granted by Spanish companies belonging to the same group, shall not guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and/or 150 of the Spanish Companies Act. Additionally, the obligations under Guarantees granted by the Spanish Guarantor in the form of a _sociedad de responsabilidad limitada shall not include any obligations or liabilities which, if incurred, would_ constitute a breach of article 401 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act, as interpreted by Spanish courts. - Where payments under the Notes Guarantees cause the amount of such Spanish subsidiary’s net assets (patrimonio neto) to fall below half the amount of its stated share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount, and provided it is not required to declare its insolvency. - Guarantees given or created by a Spanish subsidiary may be deemed null and void under Spanish law in the event that all or part of the Issuers’ obligations under the Notes which are guaranteed or secured by virtue of such guarantees are null or void, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the Issuers’ obligations under the Notes. - Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate interest benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the interest of the group and, hence, the validity of upstream guarantees. - If the beneficiary of a guarantee adhered to or votes in favor of a debtor’s refinancing agreement or commencement agreement (which contains haircuts), the guarantor shall be able to reduce its liability to the same extent, unless otherwise expressly agreed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as described in the Notary Public Law of May 28, 1862 (Ley del Notariado de 28 de mayo de 1862) (the “Notarial Law”) was significantly amended by Law 15/2015 of July 2, 2015 on Voluntary Jurisdiction (Ley 15/2015, de 2 de _julio, de la Jurisdicción Voluntaria) (“Law 15/2015”). There is a high degree of uncertainty on this new legal_ framework given that some provisions of the Notarial Law seem to conflict with laws regarding the enforcement of pledges that were not expressly repealed by Law 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of these types of auctions are open to interpretation. Amendments to the Notarial Law brought about by Law 15/2015 entered into force on October 15, 2015 and there are no leading precedents as of the date hereof that clarify how Law 15/2015 should be applied in practice. Consequently, the clauses in the pledge agreements governing auctions organized by notaries may not be enforceable in accordance with their own terms. When enforcing security interests governed by Spanish law, the following particularities shall be taken into account: - if the principal obligation is to be complied with in a jurisdiction other than Spain, it may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that compliance therewith would be illegal under the laws of the primary jurisdiction, in which circumstances any collateral securing that principal obligation in Spain may also become unenforceable. - the term “enforceable” means that the obligations assumed by the parties are of a type that the Spanish courts enforce. It does not mean that those obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. - although Spanish law does not expressly recognize the existence of two or more pledges over the same asset, the existence of two or more pledges over the same assets has become a market practice in Spain and is accepted by the majority of legal scholars although no case law has supported the enforceability of such pledges and it cannot be disregarded that a court could take a different view and consider such pledges inefficient and not admissible in Spain. - a Spanish court or a Spanish notary may not accept an enforcement of security interests governed by Spanish law in respect of the secured documents based on the breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main payment undertakings. - Spanish law does not protect the abusive exercise of rights (i.e., against such an agreement’s purpose and prejudicing third parties) or arbitrary decisions or determinations by one of the parties. Accordingly, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold the termination of an agreement based on an unreasonable, inequitable or bad faith interpretation of one of its events of default or on the breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main payment undertakings of the secured documents. - enforceability of any Spanish security documents’ provisions relating to application of enforcement proceeds will be subject to mandatory Spanish law requirements on the order of distributions. - if a transaction is performed in formal compliance with a Spanish law requirement, but the actual intention is to cover another transaction, a Spanish court will apply the law governing the transaction that was meant to be covered. - under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim, abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress or error. - as regards ordinary pledges (as opposed to pledges without transfer of possession), the Spanish Civil Code requires that the pledgor is deprived of the possession of the pledged asset. Such transfer of possession is a requirement for the valid creation of the ordinary pledge. When the pledge is a pledge over credit rights, which is not regulated by the Spanish Civil Code but generally admitted by scholars and case law, the question is if the actual transfer of possession is substituted by the notice of the creation of the pledge to the debtor of the pledged credit right. article 271.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Act admits a special privilege to pledges over credit rights if such pledge is 374 ----- contained in a document with true date (fecha fehaciente)—normally notarial document—without making any reference about the need of the notice to the debtor for the valid creation of the pledge over credit rights. Notwithstanding this, the practical effect of not notifying the creation of the pledge to the debtor is that, if such debtor effectively pays the credit to its creditor ignoring the existence of the pledge over the credit right, any such payment will have release effects (efectos _liberatorios) for the debtor and the pledgee will not have recourse against it._ - Spanish law does not regulate expressly, with respect to claims deriving from proceeds obtained through a bond issuance, that security interests may be created only for the benefit of a secured notes trustee. Further, evidence of any potential replacement of the entity acting as secured notes trustee in its position as such will need to be recorded at the relevant Spanish public registry prior to the commencement of any enforcement proceedings if the security was registered at a Spanish public registry in favor of the secured notes trustee. - the enforcement by Spanish courts of any final judgement for a sum of money in relation to the secured documents obtained against the Spanish Guarantor in any court outside of Spain may be limited by the provisions of Spanish principles of public policy (“orden público”). Moreover, the Spanish courts may refuse to apply a provision of the law of the United States if application of that provision would be manifestly incompatible with Spanish public policy (“orden público”). - under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provisions whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (“fraude de ley”) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply. - in accordance with the general principles of Spanish Civil Procedural laws, the rules of evidence in any judicial proceeding cannot be modified by agreement of the parties. Accordingly, provisions in an agreement in which determinations by a party are to be deemed to be conclusive would not be upheld by a Spanish court. A determination, designation, calculation or certificate from one party as to any matter provided in the secured documents might, in certain circumstances, be held by a Spanish court not to be final, conclusive and binding, if it could be shown to have an unreasonable or arbitrary basis or in the event of manifest error despite any provision in the secured documents to the contrary. - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left to the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. - Spanish law limits the enforcement of fixed penalty provisions contained in agreements, allowing the courts to reduce the amount of the penalty payable. - it is not beyond doubt that the entity acting as secured notes trustee may validly establish a liquidated sum in respect of a claim in a proceeding for the enforcement of security interests governed by Spanish law in accordance with the procedure established in article 572.2 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act because the secured documentation does not qualify as self-executing documents under Spanish law and, to the best of our knowledge, the Spanish courts have not handed down a judgment in relation to the applicability of said article to agreements governed by a law other than the Spanish law. Therefore, it may not be disregarded that the enforcement of the Spanish security could require that a judgment be rendered in New York establishing the default in respect of the secured obligations and the liquid amount payable thereunder which would then be recognized and enforced in Spain over the assets subject to such Spanish security. - under Spanish law, nullity or termination of the principal obligation will entail nullity or termination of collateral obligations securing it. - it is not entirely clear whether RDL 5/2005, would apply to Spanish law security interest securing the Notes. In such case, the enforcement provisions contained therein referred to RDL 5/2005 would not be effective although such security interests could be enforced through any of the other enforcement proceedings permitted by the Spanish law and contemplated in the relevant provisions included in such security interests. - a certified translation into Spanish by an official translator of any document not executed in Spanish will be required to make such document admissible in evidence in Spain if a translation made by a private translator is challenged by the party not having filed it. 375 ----- In addition, it should be noted that when granting security for existing debt within the two year suspicious period set out in the Spanish Insolvency Act for example, on the basis of a promissory security given at the time of obtaining such debt, there is a risk that security interests governed by Spanish law may fall within the legal presumption of a harmful act to the debtor’s assets provided in article 226 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act and said security interests created may be challenged (please also refer to “—Insolvency and Bankruptcy” and “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer”). With regard to security interests governed by Spanish law that need to be registered within a Spanish public registry, in addition to the above it should be noted that: - such security interests are only duly created as valid security interests, constituting and effective security interest exercisable vis-à-vis third parties, when the notarial deed by which the security interest is granted has been recorded at the relevant Spanish registry. - the competent Spanish registrar may refuse to register events of default or early termination events stipulated in the secured documents thereunder (irrespective of their governing law) which may be deemed contrary to the principles of Spanish law applicable to rights in rem over assets located in Spain, such as events of default or early termination events based on the breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main payment undertakings of the secured documents. In such case, a Spanish court or a Spanish notary would not accept an enforcement of such security interest based on an event of default or early termination event which has not been registered in the relevant Spanish public registry.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,144,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,144.13,Spain,144.13.16,"Trust, Trustee and Security Agent under Spanish law","Spanish law security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the Secured Parties under the relevant security document and each secured party must accept said security interest either entering into the relevant security documents themselves or duly represented by a Security Agent with sufficient faculties to represent the secured creditors for such purposes. Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concepts of “trust”, “trustee” or “security agent” and there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a trustee or security agent (including the Security Agent), whether this would cause delays in enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation. If Spanish-law security documents are entered into only by the security agent and not also by the creditors on account of whom the security agent or trustee would be acting, it can be argued that the security agent would be the only party entitled to enforce the security interest in respect of those obligations, consequently, the security agent may only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if such creditors grant due and express powers of attorney in favor of the security agent duly notarized and legalized (and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in order to represent them in the enforcement proceedings (nonetheless, this may not be effective in the case of judicial enforcement proceedings, where one party cannot represent another by virtue of a power of attorney). The holders of the Notes, from time to time, shall be the beneficial holders of any Spanish law security interests. However, given that they will not be parties to the Spanish law security documents that will be executed by the Security Agent on their behalf, the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are the direct beneficiaries of the security interests). Although it could be argued that article 429 of the Spanish Companies Act (which allows the representative of the syndicate of the holders of the Notes (comisario) to enforce any security interest on behalf of all holders of the Notes under certain circumstances) could apply by analogy, it cannot be disregarded that, if enforcement of the security interest is carried out by the Security Agent, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the Secured Parties duly notarized and, if not granted in Spain, with the apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961 or legalized. In the absence of the above-mentioned power of attorney, the Security Agent and/or Trustee, acting as a security agent, may not be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security on behalf of all of the secured 376 ----- creditors (including the holders of the Notes). Furthermore, any beneficial holders of a security who have not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) a security agent to do so, may be treated as unsecured creditors under Spanish law, including, without limitation, in an insolvency scenario. In addition, the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced may request the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise and the notarization of each and every transfer certificate relating to each and every transfer of the Notes. Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Such guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. As mentioned above, if Spanish law security documents are entered into only by the Security Agent (and not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the Security Agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the guarantees or the security interest in respect of those obligations and it may only be able to do so in respect of the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent unless such creditors grant the formal powers of attorney in its favor (duly notarized and legalized or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in order for the Security Agent represent them in any enforcement proceedings related to Spanish law security documents. Given that parallel debt structures have not yet been tested under Spanish law and we cannot assure you that by creating any such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by such applicable law. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the securities were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce the security. Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the securities or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator, the obligor itself or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Spanish insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of ‘‘corporate benefit’’ expressly regulated under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, however, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company and/or other companies of its group for the purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (i.e. rescission or claw-back of these actions during the two year hardening period prior to the date of declaration of insolvency, irrespective of the existence of fraudulent intent), when the obligations guaranteed or secured does not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee or security interest. Some decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees and security interests to the extent proof can be given that amounts can be borrowed 377 ----- directly by the company granting the guarantee or security interest or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company under a intercompany loan agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees, indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and financial conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with Spanish case law existing as for the construction of the concept of ‘‘compensatory advantage’’ (ventaja compensatoria). However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency scenario where the claims of the holders of the Notes, particularly as ‘‘special privilege claims’’ may be challenged if the insolvency administrator or other creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In particular, as regards the scope ratione materiae of RDL 5/2005, the EU Court of Justice judgment dated November 10, 2016 (Case 156/15), upholds a broad interpretation of the terms “principal obligation” and “secured obligation” as used in Directive 2002/47, transposed into Spanish law under RDL 5/2005. Thus, the Court considers that these terms must be considered to cover any obligation granting a right to cash settlement. In Spain, to date, there has been no Supreme Court ruling in that regard.

Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “centre of main interests” are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the “centre of main interests” is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”). In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Act may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us 381 ----- consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including, potentially, the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes and would bear the costs deriving from a possible (total or partial) cancellation of the bond hedging swaps. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and parent companies may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/ or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among, inter alios, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 45 days after the date the Notes are issued, it will not, without having received prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or such Guarantor and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and any hedging arrangements relating to the Notes). Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not registered with the SEC as U.S. registered broker-dealers and will effect offers and sales solely outside of the United States or within the United States to the extent permitted by Rule 15a-6 through one or more U.S.-registered broker-dealers and as permitted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regulations. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Investors, members of the Group’s management and/or their respective affiliates may place a purchase order for and be allocated the Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes: (i) to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S; and (ii) in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering of the Notes may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions”. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof upon their issuance. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favorable to you. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover 379 ----- short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.

Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court should automatically be recognized in Italy provided that the following requirements are met: - the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court had appropriate jurisdiction to pass judgment upon the matter (in accordance with the Italian law principles of jurisdiction); - the defendant had received the summons in accordance with the laws of the state in which the proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived of his fundamental right to a defense; - the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the proceedings were conducted in absentia (in contumacia) in accordance with such local procedural law; - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court must be final and binding (passato in giudicato) according to the law of the state in which it was issued; - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in conflict with any earlier final and binding judgment issued by an Italian court; - there is not pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and between the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court; and - the judgment rendered by the U.S. general or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public policy. In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal to this end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above (including that requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy). 389 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.3,Mexico,145.3.1,,"_General_ Two of the Guarantors are Mexican companies. No treaty is currently in effect between the United States and Mexico that covers the reciprocal enforcement of judgments issued in the other country. Generally, Mexican courts would enforce final judgments rendered in the United States if, among other things: (a) such judgment is obtained in compliance with legal requirements of the jurisdiction of the court rendering such judgment; (b) all formalities set forth in treaties relating to foreign rogatory letters, to which Mexico is a party, have been complied with; (c) such judgment is not rendered in a real action (acción real); (d) the court was competent to resolve the relevant matter in accordance with the rules of international law compatible with those adopted by the Mexican Commerce Code (Código de _Comercio);_ (e) service of process was made personally on the applicable party or on an appropriate process agent thereof; (f) such judgment is final in the jurisdiction where obtained and there is no recourse against it; (g) such judgment and the obligation enforced through such judgment do not contravene Mexican public policy or laws; (h) the action in respect to which such judgment is rendered is not the subject matter of a lawsuit among the same parties pending before a Mexican court; (i) the applicable procedure under the laws of Mexico with respect to the enforcement of foreign judgments (including the issuance of a letter rogatory by the competent authority of such jurisdiction requesting enforcement of such judgment and the certification of such judgment as authentic by the corresponding authorities of such jurisdiction in accordance with the laws thereof) is complied with; and (j) the courts of such jurisdiction recognize the principles of reciprocity in connection with the enforcement of foreign judgments in such jurisdiction. All or a substantial portion of each of the Mexican Guarantors’ assets are located and a majority of its revenues are derived from sources outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for 390 ----- investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Mexican Guarantors or upon their directors and executive officers that reside outside the United States, or to enforce against any of them in U.S. courts judgments predicated upon the civil liabilities under the laws of jurisdictions other than Mexico, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States, judgments other than an obligation to pay money for a sum certain or judgments that may contravene any Mexican law or public policy. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Mexican courts, of liabilities predicated, in whole or in part, on U.S. federal securities laws and as to the enforceability in Mexican courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Further, any proceedings before Mexican courts are to be conducted in accordance with, and any enforcement of judgments or awards in Mexico is subject to, Mexican rules and Mexican procedural law. For instance: (a) in any insolvency, concurso mercantil or bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, labor claims, claims of tax authorities for unpaid taxes, social security quotas, workers’ housing fund quotas, retirement fund quotas, litigation costs, fees and expenses related to the management of the bankruptcy estate, creditors for the expenses incurred to cover ordinary protection expenses incurred for the conservation, management or safety of the bankruptcy estate, expenses incurred in connection with any judicial or extrajudicial procedure for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate, and other claims provided under Mexico’s Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, will have priority over claims of unsecured creditors; (b) in the event of legal proceedings in the courts of Mexico, a Spanish translation of any document not prepared or executed in the Spanish prepared by a court-appointed translator would have to be approved by the court after the defendant had been given an opportunity to be heard as to the accuracy of such translation, and proceedings would thereafter be based upon such translation; in addition, in case of foreign public documents, legalization before the appropriate Mexican consulate (or an apostille in lieu of such legalization) will be required; (c) claims may become barred under statute of limitation rules in Mexico or may become subject to defenses or set-off or counter claim; in any suit brought before Mexican courts, such courts will apply statute of limitation rules; (d) procedural rights and legal defense rights cannot be validly waived under Mexican law; and (e) there are no self-help remedies recognized by Mexican law; the taking of possession, entry, removal, sale, transfer or other disposition of property or similar action in Mexico may not be made without judicial intervention and only after the defendant is given the right to be heard in court and Mexican law provides that contractual obligations provided by the Mexican Guarantors may only exist to the extent that the obligations of the principal obligor(s) are valid. Therefore, upon the lack of genuineness, validity or enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the obligations of the Mexican Guarantors pursuant to its guarantee shall be equally affected and, in such circumstance, the obligations provided for thereunder may be unenforceable in Mexico. In addition, under Mexican law, the extension or the granting of grace periods to the principal obligor(s), any modification of guaranteed obligations that would increase any obligation of the Mexican Guarantors pursuant to its guarantee, or the novation (novación) of the principal obligation, would require the consent of the Mexican Guarantors. Therefore, the obligations of the Mexican Guarantors might not be enforced by Mexican courts if the guaranteed obligations are extended, increased or novated (novadas) without the consent of the Mexican Guarantors at that time. _Service of process_ The Mexican Guarantors have appointed an agent to receive service of process with respect to any action brought against any of them in any federal or state court in the State of New York arising from this offering. Personal service of process, including service of process on a process agent is considered to be a basic procedural requirement under Mexican law. Service of process in Mexico must be made in person to be valid. If, for purposes of proceedings outside of Mexico, service of process is made by mail or other method that is not personal, such service of process would not constitute personal service of process under Mexican law. The courts of Mexico would not enforce a final judgment based on any such process. There 391 ----- are several conflicting non-binding judicial precedents that have analyzed whether service of process made at the domicile of the agent for service of process should be considered as personal process on the party being served and, as a result, no definitive and binding criteria has been set by the Mexican judiciary on this issue. _Foreign currency_ In the event that proceedings are brought in Mexico seeking enforcement of the Mexican Guarantors’ obligations in Mexico, pursuant to article 8 of the Mexican Monetary Law (Ley Monetaria de los Estados _Unidos Mexicanos), each of the Mexican Guarantors may discharge its obligations by paying any sums due_ in a foreign currency in Mexican pesos at the exchange rate for Mexican pesos applicable on the date on which payment is made, as published by Mexico’s Central Bank (Banco de México). If the Mexican Guarantors elect to make payments due on the Notes in Mexican pesos in accordance with the Mexican Monetary Law, we can make no assurances that the amounts paid may be converted back by the payee into U.S. dollars or euros at the same exchange rate or that, if converted, such amounts would be sufficient to purchase U.S. dollars or euros equal to the amount of principal, interest or additional amounts due on the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.4,The Netherlands,145.4.1,,"There is no treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and The Netherlands. Therefore, an executable judgment rendered by any competent court of New York, the United States America based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment that is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court and the judgment rendered by the foreign court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case the Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what extent it, given the circumstances of the case, will recognize the foreign judgment. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation analysis on the merits if the final judgment obtained in a competent court of New York, the United States America, is not rendered by default, is not subject to appeal or other means of contestation and is enforceable in the United States of America with respect to the payment of obligations of a Dutch company (such as the Dutch Guarantor) under the documents expressed to be subject to the laws of the State of New York (such as, inter alia, the Notes and the Indenture) and if (i) that judgment has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the principles of due justice, its contents and enforcement does not conflict with Dutch public policy (openbare orde) and it has not been rendered in proceedings of a criminal law or revenue or other public law nature, (ii) the jurisdiction of the competent court has been based on grounds that are internationally acceptable, (iii) the judgment was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iv) the judgment is not incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in The Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from US federal or state courts. No assurance can be given, however, that these judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon US federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in The Netherlands will be subject to the applicable rules of civil procedure in The Netherlands. A Dutch court has the authority to make an award in a foreign currency. However, enforcement against assets in The Netherlands of a judgment for a sum of money expressed in foreign currency would be executed in Dutch legal tender and the applicable rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment. Enforcement of obligations before a Dutch court will be subject to the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable under their governing law, to the nature of the remedies available in Dutch courts, the acceptance by such courts of jurisdiction, the effect of provisions imposing prescription periods and to the availability of defenses such as set off (unless validly waived) and counter-claim; specific performance may not always be awarded. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. 392 ----- A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a US court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.5,Scotland,145.5.1,,"The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Scotland is based upon advice provided to us by our Scottish legal advisers. The United States and Scotland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Scotland. In such an action, a Scottish court would not generally re-examine the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below). An objection may be made against the recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Scottish court on the following grounds: - the U.S. court lacked jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Scottish conflicts of laws principles and rules of Scottish private international law; - the U.S. judgment was given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment is one to which section 32 of the Civil and Jurisdiction Judgments Act 1982 applies; - the U.S. judgment was not final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment contravened Scottish public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment is for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involves the enforcement of a non-Scottish penal or revenue judgment; - the U.S. judgment is one to which section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 applies; - the U.S. judgment was obtained in proceedings which displayed a substantial degree of unfairness or procedural irregularity, or was obtained by fraud or in breach of Scottish principles of natural justice; - there is a prior inconsistent decision of a Scottish court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; or - the U.S. judgment is no longer extant or enforceable in the U.S. for example by reason of prescription or limitation. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Scotland judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Scotland. In addition, it is questionable whether a Scottish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Such provisions set forth that any, in principle, final and conclusive judgment rendered outside Spain may be enforced in Spain: - in accordance with the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between Spain and the United States for these purposes); - in the absence of any treaty, in those cases in which the relevant court from a foreign country which is not a member bound by the provisions of the EU Regulation 1215/2012, if it meets the formal requirements of (i) the relevant law from said foreign country and (ii) Spanish law, to be considered authentic, i.e., enacted by an authorized court (in Spain it would be required, inter alia, that the judgement is duly legalized or apostilled and translated into Spanish) and enforceable; and - if it does not fall within the circumstances set forth in article 46 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, in particular: (a) that the judgment breaches Spanish public order (“orden público”)’ (b) that the judgement is not final (i.e., subject to further appeal) and therefore is not an enforceable nature (fuerza ejecutiva) in the foreign jurisdiction; (c) that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching and rights of defense of any of the parties (if a judgement has been rendered by default (“en rebeldía”) of the defendant it would be deemed to breach his rights of defense if the defendant has not been regularly and timely notified to enable him to defend himself properly); (d) that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute; (e) that the foreign judgment is incompatible with other Spanish judgements; (f) that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgement which meets the requirements to be enforceable in Spain; (g) that there is an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same subject which was opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings before the foreign court; and (h) the company is subject to an insolvency proceeding in Spain and the foreign judgment does not meet the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law. Article 48 of the Spanish Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revision del fondo) by the Spanish competent court. According to Article 3.2 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, the Spanish Government may establish that the Spanish authorities will not cooperate with other country’s authorities when there has been a reiteration refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other country’s authorities. Additionally, and according to Article 47 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be recognized and enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the conditions set forth therein. The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain, which would not directly be recognized or enforced in Spain, must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera _Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) for which purpose the abovementioned_ requirements must be met. 394 ----- The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros. A final and conclusive judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions of the EU Regulation 1215/2012 will be recognized and enforceable by the Spanish courts, without review of its merits, once the judgment has been recognized under the exequatur procedure. The enforcement of any judgments in Spain entails, among others, the following principal actions and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) payment of certain professional fees required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain (if needed); (c) certain court fees and or judicial taxes must be paid, (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); (e) original or authenticated copy of the judgment duly apostilled or legalized must be filed; (f) a document evidencing the service of process in the event that the judgment was rendered in default of appearance must be filed; and (g) evidence of the judgment being final and conclusive (firme) and executory must be filed. Under Spanish law, the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. In addition, in accordance with Article 1 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the relevant agreement. As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original action to Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish Courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil Procedure Act, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute); however, this article does not expressly cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts. If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law made by the parties may be rejected by Spanish courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public policy (orden público) or it may not grant enforcement in the event that they deem that a right has been exercised in such a manner to constitute an abuse of right (abuso de derecho). 395 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Its registered office is in via Rana 12, zona industriale D6, Spinetta Marengo (Alessandria). The Guala Closures Group’s main activities involve the design and manufacturing of closures for spirits, wine and non-alcoholic beverages such as water, olive oil and vinegar to be sold mainly on international markets. The group is also active in the production of PET plastic preforms and bottles. The group’s activities are separated into two divisions: - the Closures division, representing the group’s core business, specialised in the production of safety closures, customised luxury closures, aluminium closures for wine, standard roll-on closures and other closures; - the PET division, which produces PET bottles and miniatures. This division is no longer considered a core business. Currently, the group is the European and international leader in the production of safety closures for spirits bottles, with over 60 years’ experience in the sector. It is also the leading European producer of aluminium closures for spirits bottles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Except for that set out in the (3) “Changes to standards” section, the accounting policies applied to prepare the condensed interim consolidated financial statements by all the group companies are the same as those applied to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Guala Closures Group at December 31, 2020, to which reference should be made. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euros, rounding the amounts to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies between the condensed interim consolidated financial statements balances and those in the tables of these notes are due exclusively to the rounding and do not alter their reliability or substance. Figures are shown in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise stated. The condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivatives, market warrants and contingent consideration arising in a business combination (i.e., the non-controlling investors’ put options) which are measured at fair value and investments in associates which are measured using the equity method. They have been prepared on a going concern basis. There are no business risks and/or any identified uncertainties which may cast doubts on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed interim consolidated financial statements comprise the following schedules: - statement of profit or loss, whose captions are classified by nature; - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income ; - statement of financial position, whose asset and liability captions are classified as current or noncurrent; - statement of cash flows, prepared using the indirect method; - the statement of changes in equity, prepared to present changes in equity.

Comparative data for the same period of the previous year have been reclassified accordingly. For each asset and liability caption including amounts due within and after one year, the amount which is expected to be received or paid after one year is shown. Pursuant to Consob (the Italian commission for listed companies and the stock exchange) resolution no. 15519 of July 27, 2006 on financial statements, significant related party transactions and non-recurring items have been indicated separately in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements. In preparing the condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are used to recognise the loss allowance, the allowance for inventory writedown, current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale, depreciation/amortisation and impairment losses on non-current assets, employee benefits, taxes, provisions, measurement of derivatives, market warrants and measurement of the effects of business combinations. In accordance with IAS 34—Interim Financial Reporting, the interim measurement of the figures of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements may rely on a greater use on estimation methods than annual consolidated financial statements. The measurement procedures carried out to this end ensure the reliability of the information provided and that all material financial information necessary to understand the group’s financial position and financial performance is provided.

The amendments provide practical relief from certain requirements of IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to: changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities; and hedge accounting. The amendments will require an entity to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that is required by the interest rate benchmark reform by updating the effective interest rate of the financial asset or liability. At March 31, 2021, the group has a partly availed senior revolving credit facility in British pounds (of which it has availed £11 million), accruing interest at the LIBOR and which will be subject to IBOR reform. The group expects that no significant modification gains or losses will arise as a result of applying the amendments to these changes.

The financial expense related to their fair value refers to the change in the official price of these instruments set by Borsa Italiana during the reporting period. An increase in the official price generates financial expense (as in the first three months of 2021 while it was financial income in the corresponding period of 2020) since it results in an increase of the underlying financial liability. Financial expense (or financial income) on non-controlling investors’ put options refers to the recognition of the increase (or decrease) in the financial liabilities for these investors’ right to exercise a put option if certain conditions are met.

The reduction in current taxes in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, despite the increase in the pre-tax result, is mainly attributable to the reduction in taxes in the Group companies in Eastern Europe and India due to the lower profitability of the period, while the increase in the pre-tax result is attributable to some countries, including Italy, which benefit from the use of previous losses. The deferred tax assets recognized in the result for the period differ from the change in the corresponding balance sheet items for transactions directly attributed to the other components of the comprehensive income statement (OCI) (+€52 thousand).",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

In Italy, capex was mainly directed at increasing production capacity, new product development and extraordinary plant maintenance. In Poland, capex mainly consisted of increasing production capacity. In Ukraine, capex mainly consisted of increasing production capacity, plant safety and extraordinary plant maintenance. Furthermore, Europe saw capex for new product development at the facilities in Bulgaria and the research centre in Luxembourg and for significant maintenance on plants in the UK and Ukraine. In Asia, capex targeted, in particular, the Indian facilities for extraordinary plant maintenance and new product development. In Latam-US, the main capex focused on the Mexican facility with projects mainly for plant safety and extraordinary maintenance. Smaller investments were also made in all the other facilities across the region. In Africa, capex related to extraordinary maintenance on plants in South Africa and the increase in production capacity at the facility in Kenya. In Oceania, capex mainly focused on Australia where the group invested in making the production process more efficient. Property, plant and equipment include the cost of internal work capitalised. The exchange gains for the period reflect the partial but generalised appreciation of the foreign currencies with which the group operates against the Euro, which was the stronger currency in 2020.

Licences and patents mainly refer to the Guala Closures trademark and the group’s proprietary patents, and Other mostly refers to business relationships with customers. Goodwill arising on the PPA procedure for the business acquired in Germany is unchanged at March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment. Since its recognition on July 31, 2018, goodwill has never been impaired. The group checks the recoverability of goodwill at least once a year, or more frequently if specific events or circumstances indicate impairment, by testing each CGU (cash-generating unit). Reference should be made to the 2020 annual report for information on the previous impairment test. The main economic and financial indicators of the Group for the first quarter of the 2021 financial year show a positive quarter for the Group with a gross operating profit, net working capital and net financial position in line with or slightly better than the 2021 budget utilised for the purposes of the impairment test as at December 31, 2020. The level of net invested capital at March 31, 2021 is consistent and substantially in line with the most recent forecasts at that date and therefore there have been no changes in the value of the net invested capital that could affect the validity of the impairment test carried out with reference to December 31, 2020. With reference to the discount and inflation rate underlying the impairment test carried out with reference to December 31, 2020, there are no events that have substantially impacted them and, therefore, they are still applicable and reasonables with the reference date of this Report.

Reference should be made to note 30) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for further information on the group’s exposure to interest and currency risks. On July 20, 2018, the parent entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (“RCF”) governed by the laws of England and Wales with UniCredit Bank AG, Milan Branch, as agent, and the lenders (Credit Suisse International, Banco BPM S.p.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and Unicredit S.p.A.) for a maximum amount of €80 million at the 3M Euribor/GBP Libor + 2.5% (zero floor). The RCF will expire on February 28, 2024. On October 3, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. issued floating rate bonds of €445 million (3M Euribor + 3.5% - zero floor) due in 2024 (the “Bonds”) under an indenture contract governed by the laws of the State of New York. The contract was signed, inter alia, by Guala Closures S.p.A., as the issuer, The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c., as the senior secured notes trustee and Bondholders’ representative pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, Deutsche Bank AG, London branch, as the paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as the transfer agent and the registrar (the “Indenture”). The contract governing the RCF and the Indenture of the Bonds provide for change of control clauses. Specifically, the threshold that determines a change of control according to the RCF is 35% of voting rights at Guala Closures shareholders’ meetings, while the same threshold under the Bond regulation is 50% of voting rights. Due to the finalization, in March 2021, of the agreements indicated in the press release issued by Special Packaging Solutions Investments S.à r.l. (“SPSI”) on December 8, 2020 it should be noted that the condition envisaged by the “change of control” clause relating to the RCF was met and the right to request for early repayment and extinction of the RCF credit line was exercised by a only bank of the five banks making up the pool of lending banks. The other four banks issued specific waivers, confirming the credit lines in place and the amounts used which therefore remained classified as non-current liabilities. With reference to the portion attributable to the only bank that did not issue waivers (€13 million), it should be noted that the amount used as of March 31, 2021, equal to €2.7 million, was classified under current liabilities and in full repayment was made on April 26, 2021. Therefore, following the implementation of the “change of control” clause envisaged by the RCF, the available credit line was reduced from €80 million to €67 million. SPSI published the offering document on May 8, 2021 and it states that the offering period will open on May 18, 2021 and close on June 7, 2021. At the date of this Report, the condition provided for by the “change of control” clause with reference to the Indenture that regulates the Bonds has not been fulfilled. In consideration of the situation that could arise following the outcome of the mandatory bid on Guala Closures ordinary shares, the Company is monitoring the evolution of this scenario to take the appropriate measures where the circumstances provided for by the clauses of “change of control” should occur. The Parent Company is monitoring developments with respect to the outcome of the mandatory public tender offer for its ordinary shares to take the necessary measures should the conditions provided for in the change of control clause materialise. The Parent Company has, inter alia, a covenant on the RCF. Failure to comply with it may require the parent to repay the facility earlier, should the RCF be drawn by more than 40% of its total amount F-26 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Under this covenant, the ratio of the parent’s indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, both calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions of the RCF, shall not exceed 6.40x. Under this agreement, the parent’s Treasury department is required to constantly monitor the covenant and to regularly report to management and the lending bank to ensure compliance. At March 31, 2021, not more than 40% of the facility has been used, which is the trigger for the application of the covenant. In any case, the covenant is complied with. Financial liabilities at December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021 are shown below: The interest rates and maturity dates of the financial liabilities at December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021 are shown below: Based on the Market Warrant regulation, the Warrant holders may decide to exercise them in whole or in part at any time and to subscribe the exchange shares at the subscription price, as long as the average monthly price is higher than the strike price (€10 per share). The subscription price of €0.10 per exchange share was approved by the shareholders on September 26, 2017 based on the amendments introduced on October 26, 2017. The parent will publish the acceleration communication should the average monthly price be the same as or higher than €13 per share. As a result, the holders of the Market Warrants will be assigned exchange shares based on the following exchange ratio: _Average monthly price - Strike price Average monthly price - Subscription price_ Warrants not exercised by the expiry date are taken to have been extinguished and are no longer valid when by expiry date is meant the first of the following dates: (i) the first trading date after five years from the relevant transaction’s effective date and (ii) the first trading date after 60 calendar days from the date of publication of the acceleration communication. The caption “Non-controlling investors’ put options” it refers to the recognition of the right of some minorities to exercise a put option upon the occurrence of certain conditions. This liability was calculated as the discounting of the determined value of the put option at the estimated time of exercise of the same (refer to the note to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements no. 30b) for the assumptions underlying the calculation). This caption has been recognised using the present access method, whereby the financial liability was recognised as a reduction in equity in the first year. The fluctuation in each year, if any, is recognised under financial income (expense) in profit or loss and the non-controlling interests continue to be presented separately as, to all effects, the non-controlling investors have the right to access the profit or loss pertaining to their investment. Following the Guala Closures–Space4 PPA procedure, the financial liability was adjusted to reflect the allocation of the resulting gains attributable to non-controlling investors.

They can be exercised as of this date and will entitle holders to one Management Warrant share for every exchangeable management warrant, provided that the post-merger Guala Closures share’s official price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, and against payment of a subscription price per share of Euro 13. Warrants that have not been exercised at the end of this period irrevocably become ineffective and are taken to have been extinguished as explained in the related regulations to which reference is made. At March 31, 2021, equity comprises unavailable reserves for market warrants of €19,367 thousand, of which €6,000 thousand was recognised as a decrease in the share premium reserve following the capital increase which took place on December 21, 2017 and the concurrent allocation of 10,000 thousand market warrants, and €9,367 thousand was taken as a reduction of other reserves, following the allocation of the residual 9,367,393 market warrants upon listing and the concurrent merger on August 6, 2018. The group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the group’s future and to support its development. The group thus seeks to maintain a sufficient level of capitalisation, while giving shareholders satisfactory returns and ensuring the group has access to external sources of financing at acceptable terms, including by maintaining an adequate rating. The group monitors the debt/equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net indebtedness and cash flows generated by operating activities. The board of directors carefully monitors the balance between greater returns through the right level of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position. To achieve these objectives, the group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable. The board of directors monitors the return on capital, being total equity, excluding non-controlling interests, and the amount of dividends to be distributed to holders of ordinary shares.

These co-investment agreements also provide that certain of Guala Closures shareholders would reinvest part or all of the proceeds from the sale of their shares in SPSI; and 1 Based on the information released by SPSI, “fully diluted” refers to the percentage of voting rights and Guala Closures share capital calculated based on the number and categories of shares that would be issued in the event of the (i) complete conversion of class C shares into ordinary shares and (ii) non-conversion of class B shares into ordinary shares. F-33 ----- - signed commitments (the “commitments”) to accept the mandatory public tender offer that SPSI is required to make as a result of the execution of the co-investment agreements (the effectiveness of which is linked to the presentation of the bid) for 3,656,250 ordinary Guala Closures shares, equal to 5.2% of the parent’s fully diluted share capital and 4.6% of the fully diluted voting rights. On March 25, 2021, SPSI informed the market (as required by article 102.1 of Legislative decree no. 58 of February 24, 1998, the Consolidated finance act) that it had executed the co-investment agreements, which implies that the conditions for the presentation of the mandatory public tender offer for the parent’s remaining shares (the “mandatory bid”) had been met. It also noted that it intends to make a voluntary tender offer for the “Market Warrant Guala Closures S.p.A.” (the “voluntary offer”, together with the mandatory bid, the “offers”). On the same date, the commitments became effective. SPSI’s press release of March 25, 2021 stated that, after executing the co-investment agreements, it held 33,493,940 ordinary shares, equal to 49.9% of the parent’s share capital (at this date) and 44.6% of the voting rights that can be exercised at the parent’s shareholders’ meetings (again at the date of this press release). SPSI also confirmed that it intends to apply for the delisting of Guala Closure’s ordinary shares after the mandatory public tender offer. Should the outcome of such mandatory public tender offer not make it possible to delist the shares, SPSI noted in its press release that it reserves the right to request delisting using other methods, including the merger of Guala Closures into SPSI, an unlisted company, or another unlisted company controlled by it.

(the “company” or the “parent”) (formerly Space4 S.p.A.) was incorporated by Space Holding S.r.l. on September 19, 2017 with the name of Space4 S.p.A.. It was a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), set up under Italian law as an SIV (special investment vehicle) pursuant to the Italian stock exchange regulation. Trading began on December 21, 2017. On July 31, 2018, Space4 S.p.A. acquired Guala Closures S.p.A., the parent of Guala Closures Group. On August 6, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. was merged into Space4 S.p.A.. Following the above transaction, the latter company was renamed Guala Closures S.p.A. and the group headed by Space4 S.p.A. was renamed Guala Closures Group. Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares set up under Italian law and registered with the Alessandria company registrar. Its registered office is in via Rana 12, zona industriale D6, Spinetta Marengo (Alessandria). The Guala Closures Group’s main activities involve the design and manufacturing of closures for spirits, wine and non-alcoholic beverages such as water, olive oil and vinegar to be sold mainly on international markets. The group is also active in the production of PET plastic preforms and bottles. The group’s activities are separated into two divisions: - the Closures division, representing the group’s core business, specialised in the production of safety closures, customised luxury closures, aluminium closures for wine, standard roll-on closures other sectors; - the PET division, which produces PET bottles and miniatures. This division is no longer considered a core business and, as a result of the reorganisation which entailed the sale of part of the assets and the transfer of the residual ones from Spain to the United Kingdom in 2019, the division is now closely connected to the Closures division as its customers and those of the Closure division’s Spirit sector are the same and because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory market related to the sale of closures to group customers. Currently, the group is the European and international leader in the production of safety closures for spirits bottles, with over 60 years’ experience in the sector. It is also the leading European producer of aluminium closures for spirits bottles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Starting from the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020, the Group has changed the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income which has been divided into two statements: the statement of profit or loss and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The comparative data relating to the same period of the previous year have been reclassified accordingly. For each asset and liability caption including amounts due within and after one year, the amount which is expected to be received or paid after one year is shown. Pursuant to Consob resolution no. 15519 of July 27, 2006 on financial statements, significant related party transactions and non-recurring items have been indicated separately in the consolidated financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Any changes arising therefrom are recognised in the year in which the review takes place if this only affects that year. If the review relates to both current and future years, the change is recognised in the year in which the review takes place. Hyperinflationary economy: since 2018 Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy as defined by IFRS, specifically IAS 29. Consequently, following Argentina’s inclusion in the list of hyperinflationary economies, as of July 1, 2018 and effective from January 1, 2018, Guala Closures Group has applied IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. At December 31, 2020, the group’s operations in Argentina represented approximately 2% of its revenue, (0.6)% of its operating performance and 0.3% of its net assets. Exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity. However, if the operation is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reallocated to non-controlling interests. When the group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. The following exchange rates are applied to translate those financial statements presented in currencies that are not legal tender in Italy: The production cost of finished goods includes the portions of the costs of raw materials and external materials and processing, as well as all other direct and indirect production costs reasonably attributable to the products, excluding financial expense. Purchase or production cost is calculated on a weighted average cost basis. Obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories are written down on the basis of their estimated possibility of use or future realisable value, through an accrual to the specific allowance adjusting the value of inventories. The amount is reinstated if, in subsequent years, the reasons for the write-down no longer exist. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The depreciation periods are as follows: Useful life is checked annually and, where necessary, any changes are reflected on a prospective basis. The amortisation periods for intangible assets are as follows: In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the year that such a determination is made. Financial assets: business model assessment The group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes: - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group’s key managers; - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed; - how managers of the business are compensated—e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and - the frequency, value and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity. Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the group’s continuing recognition of the assets. Financial assets that are held for trading or whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets: assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding in a given period and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as for the profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the group considers: - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features; - prepayment and extension features; and - terms that limit the group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features). A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium on its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is immaterial at initial recognition. F-64 ----- Financial assets: subsequent measurement and gains and losses ## Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. See note (n) for derivatives designated as hedging instruments. ## Financial assets measured at These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the amortised cost effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. ## Debt investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. ## Equity investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Financial liabilities: classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. See note (n) for financial liabilities designated as hedging instruments. _Derecognition_ Financial assets The group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. F-65 ----- On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. _Offsetting_ Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. _Non-financial assets_ At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets, except for inventories and deferred tax assets, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefits that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. IFRIC 14 clarifies the provisions of IAS 19 “Employee benefits” with respect to the measurement of defined benefit plan assets when there is a minimum funding requirement. A defined benefit plan is in surplus when the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation. IFRIC 14/IAS 19 only permit the recognition of this surplus at the present value of the financial benefits available through refunds or reductions in future contributions. Moreover, disclosure is required when the plan requires a minimum contribution that could give rise to a liability. For the Italian companies, starting from January 1, 2007, the Finance Act (Law no. 296 of December 27, 2006, the “2006 Finance Act”) and the relevant implementation decrees introduced important changes in the rules governing post-employment benefits (“TFR”), including the need for employees to decide on the allocation of their future benefits. In particular, this reform established that employees had to transfer the new amounts of their benefits to established pension funds after January 1, 2007 or leave them with the company; in the latter case, the company would pay these amounts to a specific INPS (Italian social security institution) treasury account. Therefore, the post-employment benefits stated in the consolidated financial statements refer to the amount due to employees, not yet paid but vested up to December 31, 2006. Usually, no costs are incurred to obtain or perform contracts with customers. Several standards and disclosure requirements require the determination of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the group measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price—i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: - Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); - Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are categorised into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the level of the lowest level input that is significant to measurement. The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as that of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group’s incremental borrowing rate (i.e., the incremental borrowing rate of each Guala Closures Group company) or the Guala Closures Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price under a purchase option that the group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The group considered the renewal options when determining the lease term and, specifically, considered as reasonably certain the exercise of the first renewal option which may be included in the lease. With respect to leases that do not contain annual automatic renewal options, the group considered the lease term based on the time horizon of the business plan prepared by group management (five years), assuming that this time horizon properly reflects a period of time adequate to assess the lease term with a reasonable certainty. Assessment of the reasonable certainty of exercising the renewal option affects the lease term which, in turn, significantly affects the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The group presents right-of-use assets separately from property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and it recognises lease liabilities under ‘financial liabilities’. To classify each lease, the group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,148,AFRICA,148.174,a)** **Accounting for business combinations,148.174.1,,"The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs. The Group has an option to apply a ‘concentration test’ that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards), then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement awards compared with the market-based measure of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to pre-combination service. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: - the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus - the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less - the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the other income caption. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of preexisting relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Hyperinflationary economy: since 2018 Argentina has been considered an hyperinflationary economy as defined by IFRS, specifically IAS 29. Consequently, following Argentina’s inclusion in the list of hyperinflationary economies, as of July 1, 2018 and effective from January 1, 2018, Guala Closures Group has applied IAS 29: Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.

They are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income (OCI). Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends and any interest and penalties imposed by the tax authorities following their review of the tax position of previous years which found a difference in tax due. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured as 12-month ECLs: - debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and - other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due. The group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as enforcing a security (if any are held). Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive). Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is partially or fully impaired to the extent the group has no reasonable expectations of its recovery. For customers, the group individually makes an assessment of the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.

Specifically, IFRS 15 introduced a new model for revenue recognition based on the following five steps: - identify the contract(s) with a customer - identify the performance obligations in the contract; - determine the transaction price; - allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; - recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue is recognised, net of returns, discounts, rebates and bonuses, as well as taxes directly related to the sale of products and the provision of services. They are measured taking into account the consideration specified in the contract with the customer. The group, which generally operates as principal, recognises revenue when it transfers control of the goods or services (point in time).

A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements, given the expectation that they will not have a significant impact on the annual financial statements: - extension of the temporary extension of the application of IFRS 9 (amendments to IFRS 4); - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16). The amendments address issues that might affect financial reporting as a result of the reform of an interest rate benchmark, including the effects of changes to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate. The amendments provide practical relief from certain requirements in IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to: changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities; and hedge accounting. The amendments will require an entity to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that is required by interest rate benchmark reform by updating the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability. At December 31, 2020, the Group has a credit line Senior Revolving Credit Facility partially used for £11 million at LIBOR interest rate that will be subject to IBOR reform.

In addition to its enormous social impact, this ongoing public health emergency is also having direct and indirect effects on general economic performance and on consumption and investments, leading to general uncertainty. The Guala Closures Group acted immediately to implement all actions necessary to minimise the social and occupational health and safety and financial impacts by defining and implementing flexible and timely action plans. From the outset, the Guala Closures Group has worked tirelessly to ensure the utmost health and safety for its employees, customers and suppliers. The group immediately implemented a series of protective measures for its personnel, investing in personal protective equipment to ensure that activities are carried out in accordance with best practices in terms of occupational safety. China was the first to sound the alarm at the beginning of the year, and the virus is now present worldwide at differing levels of intensities in the various countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 after a steadily growing number of countries reported cases. To contain the spread, the governments of the various countries introduced increasingly restrictive measures aimed at limiting movement and contact between people, as well as shutting down— sometimes entirely—production activities in sectors classed as non-essential, allowing only essential activities and production to continue, including those of the food, drinks and pharmaceuticals sector in which the group operates, along with logistics services and transport. The Guala Closures Group’s priority is and will remain ensuring the safety of its employees and business continuity. The group quickly and responsibly took all steps and safety measures identified by the authorities in the various markets, introducing new protocols, work practices and safety precautions. To this end, the safety and prevention measures introduced at the onset of the emergency are still in place and are continuously updated to comply with the new directives issued by the competent authorities. Constant liaising with key business partners such as suppliers and customers has been further ramped up with the aim of ensuring business continuity. Specific business continuity plans have been prepared with the group’s key customers. In addition to the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as the distribution of disposable masks and gloves, social distancing between workers, measuring body temperature when entering the workplace and the sanitisation of all premises every two weeks, the group entered into a Covid-19 insurance policy with AON, a leading insurance company, covering all its workers worldwide. Furthermore, the group’s focus on the communities in which it operates has seen it begin production of polycarbonate face shields in Luxembourg which are sold to businesses in order to finance the free supply of such face shields to healthcare structures in Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg. All 30 group production facilities are operational at the date of this document. Most of them continued to operate during the entire lockdown—where imposed—in compliance with the regulations for each country, as the type of activity carried out was classified among those that, except for temporary bans imposed by local governments, could continue despite the restrictions. In particular, all the group’s European facilities are and have always been operational. In detail, the Italian facilities were operational throughout the lockdown as their business was part of the essential supply chain, as were the facilities in Spain and France. Those in the UK and the newly acquired facility in Germany also continued to operate throughout the lockdown, albeit at slower rates than expected due to Covid-19. The facilities in Eastern Europe, (Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Belarus) continued to operate at full capacity. The group’s Asian facilities are among those that were most affected by the policies implemented by their respective governments to contain the spread of the virus. Indeed, the Indian facilities stopped operations on March 22 because of the country’s total lockdown imposed by the local government and F-75 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The health emergency did not stop operations at the group’s American facilities, with the exception of Argentina where production was suspended for a limited period of time (March 20 to April 1), pending authorisation to continue activities necessary for the essential supply chain. The Californian (USA) and the Mexican facilities continued to operate as they are essential to the supply chain, and at sustained rates due to the growth in volumes for brands focused on off-premises and e-commerce sales, which spiked with Covid-19. The Chilean facility continued to operate at full capacity and, in Brazil, operations never stopped since the government authorities have not implemented any lockdown measures. In Colombia, during the lockdown period from March 20 to May 11, production was converted to produce closures for disinfectants. The production of closures for spirits subsequently resumed, although sales volumes were depressed by the closure of public places of business by local government order until September. In Oceania, the group’s facilities in Australia and New Zealand continued to operate as they are considered part of essential supply chains. The group’s African facilities recorded different trends. The facility in Kenya continued to operate and, locally, no lockdowns were imposed on manufacturing activities, while the facility in South Africa was partially operational and, during the lockdown period from March 26 to April 30, only produced for the Water & Beverage and Pharma markets, which the South African government had classified as part of the essential supply chain. Conversely, production was suspended for the spirits market during that period. The group’s business was only marginally impacted by Covid-19 starting in the first quarter of 2020, when the impact was limited to operations in India, China, Argentina and South Africa, where operations were ordered to temporarily shut down, as described above. In the second quarter of 2020, the impact of Covid-19 was significant, with a loss of sale volumes mainly in the group’s operations in: India, where the government imposed a full lockdown of the country between March 22 and April 27 and banned the sale of alcohol from the end of March to the start of May with the shuttering of bars and restaurants until September; the United Kingdom, where operations are mainly geared more towards global brands and the duty free market; South Africa, where the partial closure of the facilities between March 26 and April 30 meant that it was only possible to produce limited quantities for small niches of the mineral water and beverage markets and the pharmaceutical sector and the sale of alcohol was banned from March 27 to June 1 and from July 12 to August 17; Colombia, where production was converted during the March 20 to May 11 lockdown to produce closures for disinfectants and public places of business remained shuttered until September; Spain and Italy, which were the European countries hit the hardest by Covid-19. In the second half of 2020, Covid-19 continued to impact the group’s business, although with less force than in the second quarter and the effects remained mostly concentrated in India, Spain, Italy and Colombia. The impact of Covid-19 was felt most heavily in the spirits market, being the sector with the greatest exposure to consumption in the distribution channel represented by bars and restaurants, which generally led to the formation of groups of people, given their function as public places for socialising (revenue of €402.3 million in 2019, down by €31.5 million, or 7.8%, to €370.7 million in 2020 at constant exchange rates). The severe restrictions aimed at containing and slowing the spread of the virus by limiting social contact and social gatherings resulted in the almost complete closure of the on-premises channel in the second quarter of 2020 and, in certain countries, in the third quarter as well. The strict limits to travel also adversely affected sales through the duty free (“Global Travel Retail”) channel. As regards the business trend for this year, the restrictive measures were eased towards the end of the second quarter of 2020, with local governments gradually lifting shuttering orders on the HORECA sector in the third quarter of 2020, albeit with different dynamics and, in certain cases, with the reintroduction of restrictions in specific areas. Near the end of the year, the curve of infections rose again in Europe and local authorities ordered new containment measures, which included another round of restrictions on the HORECA sector and travel. F-76 ----- In 2020, the Guala Closures Group has felt the consequences of Covid-19 both in terms of decreased sales volumes and in terms of additional costs to ensure the safety of facilities and employees and lower production efficiency as a result of ensuring compliance with safety and social distancing requirements. These were partly offset by measures to contain personnel expense, lower travel expenses and government assistance. The costs directly attributable to Covid-19 mainly relate to personal protective equipment (PPE) for employees, sanitisation and the adaptation of work areas to comply with social distancing requirements. In response to the decrease in sales volumes, the group began introducing measures to contain personnel expense in the second quarter of 2020 in order to limit the effect on the profit margin. This resulted in a decrease in personnel expense, mainly in those European countries hit the hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the United Kingdom, where the social shock absorbers introduced by the UK government (furlough) meant production could be reduced commensurate with the lower sales volumes using this income support measure, and in Spain and in Italy, where production was optimised by scheduling holiday leave for employees, concentrating production on the weekdays, avoiding production during the weekend and curtailing bonuses. In India and South Africa, where the extremely severe April lockdowns imposed by the respective governments resulted in a shutdown of around one month, personnel expense did not decrease in proportion to the drop in volumes as the group also bore the personnel expense during the shutdown period, pursuant to local regulations. There were, however, some savings on personnel expense in these countries, mainly linked to the lower use of temporary workers in India and to the smaller number of overtime hours worked, the greater use of holiday leave and the decrease in employee numbers in South Africa. In China, where the group suspended production between January 24 and February 14, personnel expense fell as a result of the government’s reduction in social security contributions and the smaller workforce as seven employees left. Colombia was the country where group operations were impacted the most in the South American region, producing only disinfectant closures between March 20 and May 11. Personnel expense savings were achieved thanks to the use of holiday leave and the relief granted by the Colombian government which suspended social security contributions for two months. In the rest of South America, where the negative impact of Covid-19 was less extreme than in the areas of Europe and Asia where the group operates, personnel expense was substantially stable in all countries. The group received assistance to decrease personnel expense in the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Argentina, reductions in social security contributions in China and liquidity support measures, particularly the postponement of the deadline for payment of indirect taxes such as VAT in the United Kingdom and the reduction of the VAT rate from 19% to 16% in Germany from July to December 2020. In financial terms, the group’s liquidity, both current and prospective, is monitored constantly. At the preparation date of this document, there were no significant impacts on collection or payment activities directly or indirectly related to the Covid-19 health emergency. The available liquidity is adequate to cover current and prospective operating needs with ample headroom available in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Such agreements between the parties include, notably, the “Free Trade Agreement”, which provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, and therefore the group’s products. With respect to transport, the same agreement provides for continued and sustainable air, road, rail and maritime connectivity. Indeed, with the exception of a few customs delays in January due to the increased administrative burdens, which have now been resolved, the group has not seen a material impact on its operations. Furthermore, the UK has rolled out a simplified process for value-added tax on imports, and this has not created any changes to the group’s cash flows and administrative streams post-Brexit. However, Brexit has clearly complicated the administrative process for imports and exports from and to the EU, but the financial impact of these additional burdens is immaterial for the group.

The transaction entailed the acquisition of Closurelogic GmbH’s property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including the building in Worms, worth €7.2 million, inventories of approximately €5.0 million, in addition to advances to suppliers of roughly €0.3 million, i.e., all owned assets and personnel, except for the shares of the Turkish subsidiary, which was acquired in September 2020, following the completion of the step plan identified in the due diligence.

Following this acquisition, the group is also a major player in the world market of glass-bottle beverages and mineral water, opening up new horizons for growth in this sector. During the eleven month period ended on 31 December 2020, the subsidiary generated net revenue of Euro 30.9 million and a loss of Euro 2.4 million. According to management, had the acquisition taken place on January 1, 2020, consolidated revenue and the consolidated loss for the period would have amounted to approximately €576.4 million and about €6.0 million, respectively. In calculating the above amounts, management assumed that the provisionally-determined fair value adjustments at the acquisition date would have been the same even if the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2020. As the other non-controlling investors—Les Muselets du Val de Loire M.V.L. S.A.S. and SACI S.à r.l.—decided not to subscribe the capital increase, the latter was fully subscribed by Guala Closures International B.V., which, to this end, waived part of the amount due from the French company, converting the loan into share capital. The capital increase was completed in February 2020, resulting in the Dutch subsidiary owning Guala Closures France S.a.s. in full. Consequently, equity attributable to non-controlling interests recognised in accordance with the group’s accounting policies at December 31, 2019 (€783 thousand) was reclassified, increasing the group’s equity. their estimated realisable value, the adjustment of inventories to their market value, the impairment of the tax assets for VAT credits that the group does not believe will be recoverable and the accrual to the provisions for risks of liabilities assumed in connection with contractual charges.

The capital subscribed by converting the £250 thousand loan granted to the company in December 2019 and by paying another £750 thousand in 2020 comprises preference shares accounting for 20% of the company’s fully diluted share capital. Under the agreements reached, the Guala Closures Group can increase its investment by subscribing specific capital increases and can also recover its investment. The investment in the associate SharpEnd, with an initial carrying amount of €1.3 million, was impaired to reflect the company’s loss in 2020 between the capital subscription date and the reporting date.

Licences and patents mainly refer to the Guala Closures trademark and the group’s proprietary patents and Other mostly refers to business relationships with customers. Goodwill increased due to the goodwill arising on the purchase price allocation procedure for the business acquired by the group in Germany. Reference should be made to note 7.1 for further details. As indicated in Note (2) Accounting policies, goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment. Since its recognition on July 31, 2018, goodwill has never been impaired. The group checks the recoverability of goodwill at least once a year, or more frequently if specific events or circumstances indicate impairment, by testing each CGU (cash-generating unit). From an accounting point of view, the Covid-19 emergency, as also referred to by ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority), configures an impairment indicator and therefore the Group has carefully checked the potential impacts on the recoverability of the values recognized as intangible assets and start-up. As indicated in note 4) Covid-19, the current Covid-19 pandemic has affected sales volumes in 2020 due to the contagion containment policies and specifically plant closures, prohibitions on alcohol consumption, restrictions to the movement and temporary closure of the on-premises consumption channel and at the same time demonstrated a strong resilience of the off-premises channels with an increase in household consumption. Goodwill recoverability is tested at consolidated level, considering Guala Closures Group as a single CGU. Indeed: - Guala has a single, integrated investment strategy at group level, pursued on the basis of centralised cost/benefit analyses that maximise the return on investment for the entire Guala Closures Group, while taking into account the performance objectives of the individual legal entities; - by virtue of the centralised strategy described above, the investments of the individual legal entities are subject to the group approval in accordance with its strategy; - strategic guidance and coordination activities are carried out centrally by a single management team; - consistency with the representation of the group’s financial results provided to the market is ensured. In particular, the results and the KPIs are disclosed at consolidated level, while for the individual legal entities only the figures relating to revenue are shown. The CGU identified by the group to monitor goodwill coincides with the level of aggregation of operations set out in IFRS 8—Operating segments which, for the group, is the Closures division. Goodwill allocated to the Closures CGU was successfully tested for impairment at the reporting date. Consequently, no impairment loss was recognised on goodwill at December 31, 2020. The recoverability of the recognised amounts is tested by comparing the net invested capital (carrying amount) of the CGU with the related recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of goodwill is equal to value in use, i.e., the present value of the operating cash flows which arise from the forecasts included in the long-term plans approved by the group (budget 2021 and business plan 2022-2025), consistent with the Group’s business model and with the duration of its products and the normalised terminal value, used to express a summary estimate of future figures over the explicit given timeframe. These cash flows are subsequently discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the group asset or CGU. F-94 ----- The discounted cash flow model is based on the cash flow projections for five years based on the business plan approved by the board of directors on March 9, 2021 which envisages a CAGR of net revenue and EBITDA of 4.3% and 7.5%, respectively. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make. Such growth rate is consistent with the inflation expected in the countries in which the group operates weighted by revenue for the geographical segment. In the 2020 valuation, the following assumptions were used: - the WACC for the Closures division was weighted by the net revenue percentage by destination market of each country in respect of the consolidated net revenue, with a weighted average of 7.4%; - long-term growth rate “g”: a value of 2.5% was used calculated by weighting the estimated inflation rate for each country (source Economist-December 2020) by the impact of net revenue by destination market on total net revenue, in line with the terminal value calculation. The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the past history and the industry weighted-average cost of capital, with a possible percentage of indebtedness of 39% at a market interest rate of 2.6%. The division’s estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by €343 million (2019: €55 million). The positive change in the surplus value identified in the recoverable amount compared to the previous year derives from the general reduction in financial parameters while the net change in the other assumptions (such as cash flows deriving from the plan and the change in perimeter) does not have a significant effect. The estimates and plan figures to which the above parameters are applied are calculated by management based on past experience and the expected developments of the markets in which the group operates at the reporting date. To this end, the current international macro-economic situation, the possible economic-financial impacts and the current downturn due to the health emergency, may result in uncertain scenarios in terms of achieving the objectives and levels of activity set out in the plan. In particular, the current Covid-19 pandemic has affected sales volumes in 2020 due to the infection containment policies (specifically, the shuttering of facilities, bans on alcohol consumption, restricted travel and temporary block on on-premises consumption). Despite the expected easing of these measures by 2021 and a progressive improvement in market conditions given the containment measures of the pandemic in progress, the growing diffusion of the availability of vaccines (although still uncertain in its timing), the presence of Group differentiated in the various countries, the estimate of these effects over the plan years is subject to extreme uncertainty, especially in the time horizon in which it is realistic to return to pre-Covid cash flows. For this reason, given the positive recovery demonstrated in the second half of 2020 and the substantial resilience of the business model in the Group, the plan was drawn up on the assumption that the Covid-19 pandemic has no effects on the plan (Covid-19 free) and in continuity with the previous business plan, effectively sterilizing this effect and assuming cash flows determined on the basis of the Group’s supply capacity, its ability to absorb any drops in turnover through containment measures costs and investments, from the very close relationships with its customers and on the potential of the reference market historically characterized by constant and countercyclical organic growth rates. In addition to the recurrent sensitivity analysis, and in order to assess the effect of the Covid-19 impacts of 2020 on the entire plan period, a “stress test” was carried out which provides for a reduction in EBITDA over the entire period of the plan and on the terminal in the hypothesis, very conservative approach, that the effects of the pandemic could have permanent effects on the volumes of the group’s activities: the reduction in EBITDA that would make the recoverable value of the CGU equal to its carrying amount at 31 December 2020 is 15.69 %, a value higher than the negative change recorded in 2020 compared to 2019 (-12.3% on a like-for-like basis; -13.7% on a current basis). The group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis of changes in the WACC and ‘g’ rates. Specifically, the WACC and the ‘g’ rates which, individually, would make the CGU’s recoverable amount F-95 ----- equal to its carrying amount at December 31, 2020 are 8.4% and 0.7%, respectively. In addition, an increase in the WACC of 0.5% would lead to a reduction in headroom of €139 million, while a reduction in the growth rate of 0.5% would lead to a reduction in headroom of €118 million. These sensitivity analyzes highlighted the Group’s low vulnerability to the effects of the crisis in the medium term and resilience in the ability to generate income in the long term. This aspect highlights even more the weight of the TV (Terminal Value) in the estimate of the value in use carried out for the purposes of the impairment test; in fact, the incidence of TV on EV based on the impairment test carried out as at December 31, 2020 is 82% (80% the incidence of TV on EV as at 31 December 2019). It follows that potential impacts that make it necessary to recognize an impairment of the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets should derive from an expected reduction in long-term cash flows considered for the purposes of terminal value, a scenario not considered probable at the date today. However, the estimate of goodwill’s recoverable amount requires management’s discretion and use of estimates, and, therefore, goodwill may be impaired in the future due to presently-unforeseeable changes in the scenario. Group management constantly monitors the circumstances and events which may result in an additional impairment test.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Specifically, deferred tax liabilities were recognised on the revaluation of the group’s assets as part of the PPA procedure following their recognition at fair value. Indeed, these revaluations are neutral for tax purposes. The higher deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of the business combination of Guala Closures Group relates to the revaluation of the following assets: - intangible assets and, specifically, Trade relationships with customers, Guala Closures trademark and Patents; - property, plant and equipment and, specifically, plant and equipment. In the year, the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. recognised deferred tax assets of €3.5 million based on the most recent estimates of taxable income forecast in the 2021-2025 five-year plan, which will make it possible to use deferred tax assets on prior year tax losses. The parent’s deferred tax assets on tax losses that it may carry forward total €11.4 million and account for most of the consolidated deferred tax assets on tax losses. Tax losses that may be carried forward at December 31, 2020 amount to €192,176 thousand and may be used according to the legislation in the various countries where the reporting companies are based. The tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely amount to €173,493 thousand and refer to Guala Closures S.p.A., Guala Closures Chile S.p.A., Guala Closures France SAS, Guala Closures North America Inc., Guala Closures UK Ltd. and Guala Closures UCP Ltd. Based on the most recent estimates of future taxable income, the group recognised deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards of €16,410 thousand, corresponding to estimated future taxable income of €59,587 thousand, which is considered probable based on the group’s tax planning. Therefore, tax loss carryforwards not included in the calculation of deferred tax assets recognised in the group’s statement of financial position at December 31, 2020 total €132,589 thousand, corresponding to potential deferred tax assets of €31,518 thousand (including €29,001 in tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely) if they were recognised.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

On October 3, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. issued floating rate bonds of €445 million (3M Euribor + 3.5%—zero floor) due in 2024 (the “Bonds”) under an indenture contract governed by the laws of the State of New York. The contract was signed, inter alia, by Guala Closures S.p.A., as the issuer, The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c., as the senior secured notes trustee and Bondholders’ representative pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, Deutsche Bank AG, London branch, as the paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as the transfer agent and the registrar (the “Indenture”). The parent has, inter alia, a covenant on the New RCF. Failure to comply with it may require the parent to repay the facility earlier, should the New RCF be drawn by more than 40% of its total amount (€80 million). Under this covenant, the ratio of the parent’s indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, both calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions of the New RCF, shall not exceed 6.40x. Under this agreement, the parent’s Treasury department is required to constantly monitor the covenant and to regularly report to management and the lending bank in order to ensure compliance. At December 31, 2020, not more than 40% of the facility has been used, which is the trigger for the application of the covenant. In any case, the covenant is complied with. Lastly, the contract governing the New RCF and the terms of the Bonds provide for change of control clauses. Specifically, the threshold that determines a change of control according to the New RCF is 35% of voting rights at Guala Closures shareholders’ meetings, while the same threshold under the Bond regulation is 50% of voting rights. Considering the situation that could arise following (i) the potential finalisation of the agreements indicated in the information released by Special Packaging Solutions Investments S.à r.l. (“SPSI”) on December 8, 2020 and (ii) the outcome of the consequent mandatory public offer for Guala Closures ordinary shares, the parent is monitoring developments in the situation, so as to take the appropriate action if the circumstances envisaged by the change of control clause arise. Financial liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2020 are shown below: The interest rates and maturity dates of the financial liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2020 are shown below: Other financial liabilities include the fair value of the market warrants at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (€5,965 thousand and €3,873 thousand, respectively). The difference between the fair value at December 31, 2020 and that at December 31, 2019 was recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year, under financial expense (€2,092 thousand). The impact on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year is attributable to the increase in the market price of the market warrants, which went from €0.20 at December 31, 2019 to €0.31 at December 31, 2020. On the date of their first trading, the parent recognised 10,000,000 market warrants, traded separately to the shares, for an amount of €6,000,000, by setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount (described in note 35) Equity attributable to the owners of the parent). Furthermore, on August 6, 2018, the date the merger became effective, another 9,367,393 market warrants were assigned for €9,367,393, setting up a negative equity reserve of the same amount. The warrants were assigned free of charge in the ratio of four market warrants to every 10 ordinary shares. They can be exercised against payment as resolved by the shareholders in their extraordinary meetings of September 26, 2017 and November 16, 2017. Based on the market warrant regulation, the warrant holders may decide to exercise them in whole or in part at any time and to subscribe the exchange shares at the subscription price, as long as the average monthly price is higher than the strike price (€10 per share). The subscription price of €0.10 per exchange share was approved by the shareholders on September 26, 2017 based on the amendments introduced on October 26, 2017. The parent will publish the acceleration communication should the average monthly price be the same as or higher than €13 per share. As a result, the holders of the market warrants will be assigned exchange shares based on the following exchange ratio: _Average monthly price – Strike price Average monthly price – Subscription price_ Warrants not exercised by the expiry date are taken to have been extinguished and are no longer valid when by expiry date is meant the first of the following dates: (i) the first trading date after five years from the relevant transaction’s effective date and (ii) the first trading date after 60 calendar days from the date of publication of the acceleration communication. Financial liabilities—non-controlling investors relate to recognition of these investors’ right to exercise a put option if certain conditions are met. It represents the discounted estimated value of the put option at its expected time of exercise. This caption has been recognised using the present access method, whereby the financial liability was recognised as a reduction in equity in the first year. The fluctuation in each year, if any, is recognised under financial income (expense) in profit or loss and the non-controlling interests continue to be presented separately as, to all effects, the non-controlling investors have the right to access the profit or loss pertaining to their investment. Following the PPA procedure, the financial liability was adjusted to reflect the allocation of the resulting gains attributable to non-controlling investors. Reference should be made to note 38) Fair value of financial instruments and sensitivity analysis for further details.

Following the pension reform, from January 1, 2007, accruing benefits have been transferred to a pension fund or a treasury fund held by Italy’s social security institution (INPS). Companies with less than 50 employees, can continue the scheme as in previous years. Therefore, contributions of future TFR to pension funds or the INPS treasury fund entails that these amounts will be treated as a defined contribution plan.

This plan has a surplus at December 31, 2020 (i.e., the fair value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation). As required by IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus that can be recognised must be less than the benefits available in the form of reimbursements or the contribution holiday: following completion of the West Bromwich site restructuring plan in 2008, the amount of the contribution holiday is zero and, therefore, the English company has not recognised the fund surplus.

The sponsor warrants attached to the special shares and assigned free of charge in the ratio of two warrants for every special share subscribed are not traded on the Italian regulated stock market or abroad. Each sponsor warrant gives its holder the right to subscribe an exchange share if the share’s official price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, which is the period between the first trading date after the Relevant Transaction’s effective date and the tenth anniversary of this date. Furthermore, on 6 August 2018, 1,000,000 Management Warrants were issued. They can be exercised as of this date and will entitle holders to one Management Warrant share for every exchangeable management warrant, provided that the post-merger Guala Closures share’s official price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, and against payment of a subscription price per share of Euro 13. Warrants that have not been exercised at the end of this period irrevocably become ineffective and are taken to have been extinguished as explained in the related regulations to which reference is made. At December 31, 2020, equity comprises unavailable reserves for market warrants of €19,367 thousand, of which €6,000 thousand was recognised as a decrease in the share premium reserve following the capital increase which took place on December 21, 2017 and the concurrent allocation of 10,000 thousand market warrants, and €9,367 thousand was taken as a reduction of other reserves, following the allocation of the residual 9,367,393 market warrants upon listing and the concurrent merger on August 6, 2018. The group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the group’s future and to support its development. The group thus seeks to maintain a sufficient level of capitalisation, while giving shareholders satisfactory returns and ensuring the group has access to external sources of financing at acceptable terms, including by maintaining an adequate rating. The group monitors the debt/equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net indebtedness and cash flows generated by operating activities. The board of directors carefully monitors the balance between greater returns through the right level of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position. To achieve these objectives, the group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable. F-107 ----- The board of directors monitors the return on capital, being total equity, excluding non-controlling interests, and the amount of dividends to be distributed to holders of ordinary shares.

These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables and financial investments. The group’s exposure to credit risk depends largely on each customer’s specific characteristics. The demographics of the group’s customer portfolio, including the sector insolvency risk and the country risk, have an impact on the credit risk. The group accrues a loss allowance equal to the estimated losses on trade and other loans and receivables. It comprises both the recognition of impairment losses for material individual amounts and the recognition of collective impairment for similar groups of assets to cover losses already incurred but not yet identified. The collective impairment losses are calculated on the basis of historical payment statistics. Most of the group’s trade receivables are due from leading operators of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage segment. Most of its trading relationships are with longstanding customers. The group reduces its credit risk using supplier financing lines made available by the group’s main customers, factoring without recourse part of its trade receivables. The group’s historical figures indicate a modest amount of credit losses. The risk is fully covered by the corresponding loss allowance recognised in the consolidated financial statements. There are no cases of particularly concentrated credit risk in geographical terms. At December 31, 2019 and 2020, trade receivables may be analysed by geographical segment as follows: Other currencies include trade receivables in the following local currencies: - the individual cash flows are discounted using risk-free rates ruling on the measurement date. These rates are deducted from the swap rates using the bootstrap method for each expiry date of the corresponding cash flow based on the resulting time curve; - furthermore the individual cash flows are discounted using an additional rate, based on the group’s credit standing, calculated as the weighted average of the spreads applied to the different financing agreements. The spreads applied to the financing agreements are deemed to objectively represent the group’s credit standing and subsequent significant changes should not arise given its current financial position. The following table shows the sensitivity analysis for the cash flows from these financial liabilities and the related hedging derivatives at December 31, 2020: _Other price risk_ As a result of the nature of its activities, the group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of raw materials, particularly plastics and aluminium. The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of plastics has not been hedged as these raw materials were not listed on international markets. The risk of fluctuations in the purchase price of aluminium is partly hedged based on market needs and outlook through derivatives which set the forward purchase price. The following table shows the summary of the expirations of the aluminum derivatives contracts:",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The group’s approach to liquidity management is to ensure adequate funds are always available to meet its obligations at the expiry dates, both in normal conditions and at times of financial difficulty, without incurring borrowing expense at terms higher than market conditions. The group generally ensures there is sufficient cash and cash equivalents to cover forecast short-term operating expenses, including those related to financial liabilities. Contingent effects arising from extreme situations that cannot reasonably be forecast, such as natural disasters, are excluded from the above. The aim of Guala Closures Group’s financing strategy is to maintain a well-balanced maturity profile for liabilities to thereby reduce the refinancing risk. Historically, the group has always met its obligations on time and has been able to re-finance indebtedness before its expiry.

137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,148,AFRICA,148.507,"Notes to the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2019 GENERAL INFORMATION (1) General information",148.507.1,,"Guala Closures S.p.A. (the “company” or the “parent”) (formerly Space4 S.p.A.) was incorporated by Space Holding S.r.l. on September 19, 2017 with the name of Space4 S.p.A.. It was a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), set up under Italian law as an SIV (special investment vehicle) pursuant to the Italian stock exchange regulation. Trading began on December 21, 2017. On July 31, 2018, Space4 S.p.A. acquired Guala Closures S.p.A., the parent of Guala Closures Group (“pre-merger Guala Closures” or “pre-merger Guala Closures Group”, respectively). On August 6, 2018, Guala Closures S.p.A. was merged into Space4 S.p.A.. Following the above transaction, the latter company was renamed Guala Closures S.p.A. and the group headed by Space4 S.p.A. was renamed Guala Closures Group. Guala Closures S.p.A. is a company limited by shares set up under Italian law and registered with the Alessandria commercial register. Its registered office is in via Rana 12, zona industriale D6, Spinetta Marengo (Alessandria). Further to the acquisition of pre-merger Guala Closures Group completed by Space4 S.p.A. on July 31, 2018, the 2018 comparative figures included in these consolidated financial statements comprise those of just Space4 S.p.A. for the period from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018 and post-merger Guala Closures Group (i.e., consolidation scope including Space4 S.p.A. and pre-merger Guala Closures Group) for the period from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Therefore, they cannot be compared with 2019. These consolidated financial statements reflect the completion of the procedure to allocate the purchase prices to the identifiable assets acquired, the identifiable liabilities assumed and the non-controlling interests acquired by Guala Closures Group as part of the acquisition of pre-merger Guala Closures Group (note 6.1) and the acquisition of United Closures and Plastics (UCP). Consequently, the December 31, 2018 comparative figures have been restated in order to recognise the effects of the business combinations that took place on July 31, 2018 (Guala Closures Group) and UCP on December 12, 2018 as of such dates (note 6.2). Guala Closures Group’s main activities involve the design and manufacturing of closures for spirits, wine and non-alcoholic beverages such as water, olive oil and vinegar, as well as pharma products to be sold mainly on international markets. The group is also active in the production of PET plastic preforms and bottles. The group’s activities are separated into two divisions: - the Closures division, representing the group’s core business, specialised in the production of Safety closures (safety product line), customised closures (luxury product line), aluminium closures (wine product line), roll-on closures (standard product line) and closures for the pharmaceutical and other sectors; - the PET division, which produces PET bottles and miniatures. This division is no longer considered a core business and, as a result of the reorganisation which entailed the sale of part of the assets and the transfer of the residual ones from Spain to the United Kingdom during the year, the division is now closely connected to the Closures division as its customers and those of the Closure division’s Spirit sector are the same and because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory market related to the sale of closures to group customers. Currently, the group is the European and international leader in the production of safety closures for spirits bottles, with over 60 years’ experience in the sector. It is also the leading European producer of aluminium closures for spirits bottles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640
137_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,148,AFRICA,148.509,"Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued) at December 31, 2019 (2) Accounting policies (Continued)",148.509.1,,"The consolidated financial statements of Guala Closures S.p.A. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 are the first set of annual consolidated financial statements which cover the group’s 12-month operations after Guala Closures Group was acquired by Space4 S.p.A. on July 31, 2018. The comparative figures at December 31, 2018 include the 12-month operations of Space 4 S.p.A. and the 5-month operations of Guala Closures Group, i.e., between July 31, 2018 and December 31, 2018. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euros, rounding the amounts to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies between the consolidated financial statements balances and those in the tables of these notes are due exclusively to the rounding and do not alter their reliability or substance. Figures are shown in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivatives, market warrants and contingent consideration arising in a business combination (i.e., the put option on non-controlling interests) which are measured at fair value, and on a going concern basis. There are no business risks and/or any identified uncertainties which may cast doubts on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the following formats: - statement of financial position captions are classified by current and non-current assets and liabilities; - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) captions are classified by nature; - the statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method; - the statement of changes in equity has been prepared in accordance with the structure of changes in equity. For each asset and liability caption including amounts due within and after one year, the amount which is expected to be received or paid after one year is shown. Pursuant to Consob resolution no. 15519 of July 27, 2006 on financial statements, significant related party transactions and non-recurring items have been indicated separately in the consolidated financial statements. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement awards compared with the market-based measure of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service. Such estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Any changes arising therefrom are recognised in the year in which the review takes place if this only affects that year. If the review relates to both current and future years, the change is recognised in the year in which the review takes place. payments. Previously, the group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognised. Short-term leases, i.e., with a term of less than 12 months, and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, which have been excluded from the scope of IFRS 16 as per the practical expedient, are recognised as operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application, while the right-of-use asset is measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease. As a result of the simplifications and practical expedients adopted by the group, there are no effects of the FTA recognised in the reserves at January 1, 2019. The following exchange rates are applied to translate those financial statements presented in currencies that are not legal tender in Italy: Property, plant and equipment are shown net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses determined as set out later on. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The depreciation periods are as follows: Other intangible assets, which all have a finite useful life, are subsequently shown net of accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses, determined in the same way as described for property, plant and equipment. Useful life is checked annually and, where necessary, any changes are reflected on a prospective basis. The amortisation periods for intangible assets are as follows: In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the year that such a determination is made. Financial assets: business model assessment The group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes: - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group’s key managers; - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed; - how managers of the business are compensated—e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and - the frequency, value and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity. Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the group’s continuing recognition of the assets. Financial assets that are held for trading or whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets: assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding in a given period and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as for the profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the group considers: - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features; - prepayment and extension features; and - terms that limit the group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features). A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium on its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is immaterial at initial recognition. F-148 ----- Financial assets: subsequent measurement and gains and losses ## Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. See note (n) for derivatives designated as hedging instruments. ## Financial assets measured at These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the amortised cost effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. ## Debt investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. ## Equity investments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Financial liabilities: classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. See note (n) for financial liabilities designated as hedging instruments. _Derecognition_ Financial assets The group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged cancelled or expire. The group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. F-149 ----- On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. _Offsetting_ Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. Non-financial assets At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets, except for inventories and deferred tax assets, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefits that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. IFRIC 14 clarifies the provisions of IAS 19 “Employee benefits” with respect to the measurement of defined benefit plan assets when there is a minimum funding requirement. A defined benefit plan is in surplus when the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation. IFRIC 14/IAS 19 only permit the recognition of this surplus at the present value of the financial benefits available through refunds or reductions in future contributions. Moreover, disclosure is required when the plan requires a minimum contribution that could give rise to a liability. For Italian entities, starting from January 1, 2007, the Finance Act (Law no. 296 of December 27, 2006, the “2006 Finance Act”) and the relevant implementation decrees introduced important changes in the rules governing post-employment benefits (“TFR”), including the need for employees to decide on the allocation of their future benefits. In particular, this reform established that employees had to transfer the new amounts of their benefits to established pension funds after January 1, 2007 or leave them with the company; in the latter case, the company would pay these amounts to a specific INPS (Italian social security institution) treasury account. Therefore, the post-employment benefits stated in the consolidated financial statements at the end of the year refer to the amount due to employees, not yet paid but vested up to December 31, 2006. There are no significant discounts for final customers and there are no contracts which enable customers to return products (with the exception of faulty goods or replacements of damage goods that are accounting for in the Provision for returns) in exchange for new ones or cash reimbursements. Usually, no costs are incurred to obtain or perform contracts with customers. Several standards and disclosure requirements require the determination of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the group measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price—i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: - Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); - Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are categorised into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the level of the lowest level input that is significant to measurement. The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. - updates to the definition of assets and liabilities and the recognition of financial assets and liabilities; - greater clarity on the principles of prudence, uncertainties in assessments, substance over form and directors’ responsibility. - Definition of “material” (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8). As part of the Better Communication in Financial Reporting project, with which the IASB intends to improve the way financial information is communicated to users of the financial statements, the definition of “material” was amended. This is a pervasive principle in IFRS and affects not only the recognition, measurement and presentation of financial statements items, but also the selection of the disclosure in the notes thereto. Prior to the amendment, the definition of “material” was covered by both paragraph 7 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and paragraph 5 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Following the amendment, this definition was amended and extended only in the first standard, while the second standard only makes reference to the definition included in IAS 1.7. The aim of the amendment is to clarify that not all omitted information is material. Consequently, financial statements preparers are not obliged to provide mandatorily all disclosures required by the individual standards. Rather, they must provide only those that are material for financial statements users. Another amendment clarifies that information is material not only if it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make if omitted or misstated, but also if concealed. Indeed, the effect would be the same as an omission or misstatement. - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7). In this first phase of the project, the IASB amended IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 to enable entities not to terminate hedging transactions, until the interest rate benchmark reform is completed. Specifically, it provides temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements (IFRS 9 and IAS 39) to be mandatorily applied to all hedging transactions directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. At the reporting date, the European Union had not yet completed the endorsement process for the following standards and amendments: - IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts - IFRS 17—Insurance Contracts - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) - Definition of business (Amendments to IFRS 3) - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Recognition and measurement,148.524.1,,"The group recognises a right-of-use asset, separately from property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease, which is the date on which the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use to the lessee. The group initially measures the right-of-use asset at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation/amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. It depreciates/amortises the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the group uses the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee (the group company) or the group. The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and decreased to reflect the lease payments made. The group remeasures the lease liability to reflect changes in the in-substance fixed or variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate used to determine those payments, in any residual value guarantees provided to the lessor by the lessee or, if appropriate, there is a change in the assessment of whether the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise a purchase or extension option or it is reasonably certain it will not exercise a termination option. The lessee considered the renewal options when determining the lease term and, specifically, considered as reasonably certain the exercise of the first renewal option which may be included in the lease. With respect to leases that do not contain annual automatic renewal options, the group considered the lease term based on the time horizon of the business plan prepared by group management (five years), assuming that this time horizon properly reflects a period of time adequate to assess the lease term with a reasonable certainty.

They are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends and any interest and penalties imposed by the tax authorities following their review of the tax position of previous years which found a difference in tax due. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured as 12-month ECLs: - debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and - other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due. The group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as enforcing a security (if any is held). Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive). Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is partially or fully impaired to the extent the group has no reasonable expectations of its recovery.

The provisions are stated as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date or to transfer it to a third party at that date. If the impact of discounting the time value of money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money.

Specifically, IFRS 15 introduced a new model for revenue recognition based on the following five steps: - identify the contract(s) with a customer - identify the performance obligations in the contract; - determine the transaction price; - allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; - recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue is recognised, net of returns, discounts, rebates and bonuses, as well as taxes directly related to the sale of products and the provision of services. They are measured taking into account the consideration specified in the contract with the customer. The group, which generally operates as principal, recognises revenue when it transfers control of the goods or services (point in time). Control of the safety and standard closures is transferred to the customers when the goods are delivered to their premises, i.e., when the goods are taken over by the carrier selected by the customer if earlier and, accordingly, the group recognises the related revenue at such times.

It is a practical tool that helps the IASB to develop new standards, assists preparers of financial statements to develop consistent accounting policies when no standard applies and assists all parties to understand and interpret IFRS [CF.SP1.1].

The United Kingdom officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020, three and a half years after the referendum of June 23, 2016 which followed an extended and troubled internal Brexit review process. A formal transition period has now commenced, during which the status quo is expected to be maintained in the existing trade agreements between both parties, until a new trade deal is agreed by the parties before the end the negotiations. The duration of the transition period is uncertain, although the aim is to reach an agreement before the end of 2020.

If the negotiation fails and a trade deal is not reached, the risk is that customs duties will be applied on transactions between the United Kingdom and the European Union, significant fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Pound against the Euro and the possibility of even stricter regulations being applied. The Guala Closures Group has closely monitored the Brexit process and has deemed that there are no significant related risks that could materially affect the group’s assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The group does not expect that the future financial performance of its operations in the United Kingdom will be significantly impacted by Brexit due to a local presence with long established customer relationships and to a market which offers stable real growth in volumes and the possibility of hedging in order to maintain the assumptions on profit margins envisaged in the budget. The group has taken the following mitigating factors into account in evaluating the Brexit-related risks: - its consolidated relationships with its customers, which are mainly local companies belonging to large groups with which the Guala Closures Group has longstanding commercial relationships; - a stable market which is resilient to changes in socio-political conditions; - the group’s position as market leader of its sector; - most of the UK cross-border transactions are with the European Union and a trade deal between the parties is, at, present, likely; - the expectation that the market will absorb any customs duties through consumer prices and that they are recharged to the added value of the products sold; - financial liabilities are mostly in euros and only a small portion is in pounds sterling. There are no significant non-current financial assets and liabilities in pounds sterling; - the group’s local companies that operate in the United Kingdom do not have exposures to banks in the United Kingdom; - the human resources in the United Kingdom are local and there are no significant risks expected in relation to customs restrictions on the entrance of people into the United Kingdom; - no significant contractual risks have been identified. The group and, especially, Guala Closures UK and Guala Closures UCP are prepared for a hard Brexit outcome and have introduced new procedures for imports to manage the flow of goods from the EU and to the United Kingdom. While there is great uncertainty about future events, based on the above-mentioned internal assessments and supported by meetings with the customers of the local group companies, the group has not identified significant factors that would suggest that its production and sales will be greatly affected by Brexit. Although it is not currently expected to have a material impact on the group’s operations, the Brexit process remains uncertain and could give rise to restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the member states of the European Union, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the Euro and more stringent regulations which could negatively and significantly impact the group’s operations and financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

The group’s CEO (the chief operating decision maker) reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in this reportable segment. The Closures division represents the group’s core business. Other operations include the PET division which did not meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments under IFRS 8 in December 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, Guala Closures Group launched the reorganisation of the PET division, the activities of which were only performed by Guala Closures Iberica, up until the acquisition of the British UCP on December 12, 2018. After acquiring UCP, the group decided to reorganise the division by transferring part of the assets to a non-group operator in this sector and to concentrate the remaining ones with the newly acquired Guala Closures UCP. The reorganisation was undertaken to benefit from the sale of a non-strategic business to a third party and to concentrate production in a single group facility, thereby generating economies of scale. As a result of the reorganisation, the division is closely connected to the Closures division as its customers and those of the Closure division’s Spirit sector are the same and because the PET division’s activities are substantially an accessory market related to the sale of closures to group customers. Information regarding the results of the group’s reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment revenue, operating profit, amortisation and depreciation, trade receivables, inventories, trade payables, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and capital expenditure as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the CEO and by the board of directors. Management considers the above information as the most suitable to evaluate the results of the segment compared to other entities that operate in these industries.

The main assumptions applied to the trade relationships with customers are as follows: - Useful life: 25 years - Churn rate: 4% calculated as the average between the company’s churn rate and the churn rate embedded in the average useful life of the trade relationships with customers shown in the PPA procedures of comparable companies - Tax rate weighted by EBIT generated by the group’s divisions Patents** The fair value of patents was estimated using the relief from royalties method, whereby the intangible asset is measured at the present value of the consideration (royalty flows) to which the owner of the asset would be entitled as a right to use the asset over a period equal to the estimated residual useful life of the asset, assuming that it did not own the asset. The main assumptions applied to patents are as follows: - Specific useful life as per each patent registration document - Royalty rate: 4% as per the group’s policy and current market practices, net of the estimated maintenance costs - Specific tax rate of the country of registration F-165 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

This transaction enabled the Guala Closures Group to expand its footprint in the Scottish market, enhancing sales activities and its innovation and production processes. Indeed, the group will be able to consolidate its collaboration with the spirits multinationals in Scotland, particularly those of whisky, one of the most important segments in the spirits market. The transaction will also boost the industrial reorganisation process launched by the group in 2018 in the pursuit of greater production efficiency.

In Asia, substantial capital expenditure was undertaken at the group’s Indian facilities, particularly in relation to the expansion of the Dharwad production facility during the year. In the LATAM-USA area, capital expenditure mainly focussed on the group’s Mexican facility with projects to cut production costs and increase production capacity; smaller capital expenditure was also made in all the other facilities in the area. In Africa, most capital expenditure was directed at Guala Closures East Africa’s Kenyan facility, where production began in February 2019. In Oceania and, specifically, in Australia and New Zealand, only small investments of immaterial amounts were made for maintenance. The impairment losses of the year were recognised in connection with the reorganisation of the subsidiaries Guala Closures France and Beijing Guala Closures. The historical cost of property, plant and equipment was restated following the above-mentioned PPA procedure. Plant and machinery reflect the fair value calculated at cost, as described in note 6.1.4. As a result of the application of IFRS 16, the group reclassified finance leases recognised under IAS 17 in the 2018 consolidated financial statements (€12.2 million) to “Right-of-use assets” at January 1, 2019. Property, plant and equipment include the cost of internal work capitalised. Disposals mainly relate to the sale of the PET sector assets owned by Guala Closures Iberica (Spain).

The group checks the recoverability of goodwill at least once a year, or more frequently if specific events or circumstances indicate impairment, by testing each CGU (cash-generating unit). Goodwill is allocated entirely on Closures division and it is tested at consolidated level. Indeed: - the investment strategy is unique and integrated at group level, pursued on the basis of the central development of cost/benefit analyses that maximise the return on investment for the entire Guala Closures Group, while taking into account the performance objectives of the individual legal entities; - by virtue of the centralised strategy described above, the investments of the individual legal entities are subject to the group approval in accordance with its strategy; - strategic guidance and coordination activities are carried out centrally by a single management team; - consistency with the representation of the group’s financial results provided to the market is ensured. In particular, the results and the KPIs are disclosed at consolidated level, while for the individual legal entities only the figures relating to revenues are shown. The CGU identified by the group to monitor goodwill coincides with the level of aggregation of operations set out in IFRS 8—Operating Segments which, for the group, is the Closures division. Goodwill allocated to the Closures CGU was successfully tested for impairment at the reporting date. Consequently, no impairment loss was recognised on goodwill at December 31, 2019. The recoverability of the recognised amounts is tested by comparing the net invested capital (carrying amount) of the CGU with the related recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of goodwill is equal to value in use, i.e., the present value of the operating cash flows which arise from the forecasts included in the long-term plans approved by the group, and the normalised terminal value, used to express a summary estimate of future figures over the explicit given timeframe . These cash flows are subsequently discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the group asset or CGU. The discounted cash flow model is based on the cash flow projections for five years based on the business plan approved by the board of directors on March 9, 2020 which envisages a CAGR of net revenue and EBITDA of 4% and 6%, respectively. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make. Such growth rate is consistent with the expected inflation rate for the countries in which the Group operates weighted for revenue by geographical area. In the 2019 valuation, the following assumptions were used: - the WACC for the Closures division was weighted by the 2019 net revenue percentage of each destination market country in respect of the 2019 consolidated revenues, with a weighted average of 8.4%; - long-term growth rate “g”: a value equal to 2.7% was used, calculated by weighting the expected inflation rate for net revenue percentage of each destination market country in respect of the 2019 consolidated revenues, in line with the calculation for the terminal value. The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the past history and the industry average weighted-average cost of capital, with a possible debt leveraging of 40% at a market interest rate of 2.8%. The division’s estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by over €55 million. The estimates and plan figures to which the above parameters are applied are calculated by management based on past experience and the expected developments of the markets in which the group operates at the date of this consolidated financial statements. To this end, the current international macroeconomic situation and the possible financial impacts, the current context of contraction following the F-180 ----- health emergency, may result in uncertain scenarios in terms of achieving the objectives and levels of activity set out in the plan without, however, causing the impairment of recognised goodwill. However, the estimate of goodwill’s recoverable amount requires management’s discretion and the latter’s use of estimates, and although part of the forecast net revenue and gross operating profit of the Closures CGU may be delayed from one year to the following year, while nonetheless achieving the total growth expected by the plan, it cannot be excluded that goodwill will be impaired in the future due to presentlyunforeseeable changes in the scenario. The circumstances and events which may result in an additional impairment test are constantly monitored by the group’s management. Based on the above, management carried out a sensitivity analysis of changes in the WACC and ‘g’ rates. Specifically, the values of WACC and ‘g’ rate that individually would result in the CGU recoverably value equal to the carrying amount as at 31 December 2019 are respectively equal to 8.6% and 2.4%.

Deferred tax liabilities mainly relate to the business combination of Guala Closures Group which took place on July 31, 2018. Smaller deferred tax liabilities also refer to the business combination of UCP on December 12, 2018. Specifically, deferred tax liabilities were recognised on the revaluation of the group’s assets as part of the PPA procedure following their recognition at fair value. Indeed, these revaluations are neutral for tax purposes. The higher deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of the business combination of Guala Closures Group is recognised on the revaluation of the following assets: - intangible assets and, specifically, Trade relationships with customers, Guala Closures trademark and Patents; - property, plant and equipment and, specifically, plant and equipment During the year, the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. recognised deferred tax assets of €7.9 million based on the most recent estimates of the taxable income for the 2020-2024 five-year plan, which allows the offsetting of prior year tax losses. The changes of the year reflect the adjustment of deferred tax liabilities to the new tax rate in India and Italy. They may be analysed as follows: - €4.0 million was released in respect of the deferred tax liabilities recognised on the gains on the group’s PPA procedure allocated to Guala Closures India following the new tax rate approved by the Indian government in September and applicable retrospectively from April 1, 2019. Consequently, the new rate was essentially decreased from 35% to 25% of the taxable income; - the -€2.0 million adjustment of Guala Closures S.p.A.’s deferred taxes due to the new IRAP rate (5.57% compared to 3.90%) applicable in the years in which the temporary differences on which the deferred taxation is recognised will be reversed, as a result of Guala Closures S.p.A. becoming an “industrial holding company” and the related tax scheme that will be applicable from the date of approval of the 2019 financial statements. The tax losses that can be carried forward at year end total €180,986 thousand. They may be used in accordance with the legislation of the different countries in which the companies to which they relate are based. F-182 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,640

Failure to comply with it may require the parent to repay the facility earlier, should the New RCF be drawn by more than 40% of its total amount (€80 million). Under this covenant, the ratio of the parent’s indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, both calculated in accordance with the contractual provisions of the New RCF, shall not exceed 6.40x. Under this agreement, the parent’s Treasury department is required to constantly monitor the covenant and to regularly report to management and the lending bank in order to ensure compliance. At December 31, 2019, the facility has not been used for more than 40%, which is the triggering condition for the application of the covenant. In any case, the covenant is complied with.

The provision has been calculated considering the cost of terminating the existing agreements and the benefits due to employees under the related contracts. The provision is unchanged since the production site has not yet been definitively discontinued. - €288 thousand for the reorganisation of Guala Closures France, commenced in March 2019 and entailing investments at the Chambray facility for the production of small batches of closures for the wine sector with very short lead times to meet market requirements. As a result of this investment in the Chambray facility, assets (machinery and part of the workforce) will be transferred from the Saint Remy Sur Avre facility, which will be shut down. Part of the assets will go to the Chambray facility and part will go to other group companies. The Saint Remy Sur Avre facility was originally scheduled to close at the end of July, but this was postponed by about one year to meet the requirements of customers and distributors that are unable to independently support the taxation of closures. Therefore, limited operations continue at the facility with approximately 11 employees.

After acquiring UCP, the group decided to reorganise the division by transferring part of the activities carried out by Guala Closures Iberica to a non-group sector operator and to assign the remaining ones to Guala Closures UCP. Following the reorganisation, at the end of July, the Guala Closures Iberica’s PET facility in Alcalà De Henares (Madrid) was definitively closed, terminating the contracts with the employees working at the facility. The initial accrual of €1,630 thousand decreased to the current €13 thousand following the use of the provision for payments made. The provision for returns reflects the calculation for customer claims received based on the negotiations in place at the reporting date. The increase on the previous year is entirely due to the rise in provision for returns of the parent, Guala Closures S.p.A., due to one-off qualitative issues it encountered during the year. At December 31, 2019, the provision for contingencies and the other provisions are entirely related to the evaluations carried out during Guala Closures UCP’s PPA procedure whereby the estimated liabilities acquired as part of the business combination (€282 thousand) were allocated to these provisions.

All of the costs reinstated in the tax base were for services which the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. provided to the subsidiary and recharged under an agreement signed on September 15, 2014. The tax inspectors based their findings on a lack of documentation providing evidence that the parent effectively performed the services. At the date of this report, Guala Closures Group management is preparing a brief to send to the local tax authorities responsible for issuing the definitive tax assessment report, in the belief that they can document that the parent Guala Closures S.p.A. effectively performed the services for the subsidiary GCL Pharma S.r.l., therefore has not been recognized any provision in connection to this tax assessment, considering that GCL Pharma S.r.l. participates in the national tax consolidation scheme pursuant to articles 117-128 of Presidential decree no. 917 of December 22, 1986 with the parent Guala Closures S.p.A..

Guala Closures UK has a defined benefit pension plan under which the employees of the former Metalclosures Ltd have the right to a pension. This plan has a surplus at December 31, 2019 (i.e., the fair value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation). As required by IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus that can be recognised must be less than the benefits available in the form of reimbursements or the contribution holiday: following completion of the West Bromwich site restructuring plan in 2008, the amount of the contribution holiday is zero and, therefore, the English company has not recognised the fund surplus. In addition, the group did not have contingent liabilities at the reporting date as the fund covers the present value of its future obligations with its plan assets.

Guala Closures S.p.A. has subscribed and paid-in share capital of €68,907 thousand, consisting of 67,184,904 shares, of which 62,049,966 ordinary shares, 4,322,438 class B multiple-vote shares (Class B special shares entitle the holders to three votes per share and upon any transfer of the Class B special shares to a third-party, the Class B special shares voting rights will be reduced from three votes per share to one vote per share) and 812,500 class C shares with no voting rights. Similarly, 19,367,393 market warrants, 2,500,000 sponsor warrants and 1,000,000 management warrants are outstanding. The special shares Class C to which, upon issue, 2,500,000 sponsor warrants have been attached, have the same rights as the ordinary shares, with the sole exception of the following: - they do not have voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings; - they do not have the right to dividends approved as ordinary dividends; - they cannot be transferred until the last day of the twelfth month after the Relevant Transaction and, should the Relevant Transaction not take place, for the maximum duration of the company as established by article 4 of the by-laws except for (i) those transferred to the withdrawing shareholders of Space Holding after the liquidation procedure as payment in kind for the sale of their investment; and (ii) those transferred to the beneficiary of a proportionate demerger of Space Holding S.r.l.; - if the Company is dissolved, they give the right to their voters to be paid their stake of liquidation equity after the ordinary shareholders; - they give the right to receive two sponsor warrants for every special share issued; - when certain conditions are met, the special shares are automatically converted into ordinary shares, at the ratio of 4.5 ordinary shares for each special share, without the need for their holders to express their intention to convert and without any change to be made to the amount of share capital, provided that the conversion will decrease the implicit carrying amount of ordinary shares. The sponsor warrants attached to the special shares and assigned free of charge in the ratio of two warrants for every special share subscribed are not traded on the Italian regulated stock market or abroad. Each sponsor warrant gives its holder the right to subscribe an exchange share if the share’s official price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, which is the period between the first trading date after the Relevant Transaction’s effective date and the tenth anniversary of this date.

They can be exercised as of this date and will entitle holders to one Management Warrant share for every exchangeable management warrant, provided that the post-merger Guala Closures share’s official price is equal to or higher than Euro 13 for at least one day in the exercise period, and against payment of a subscription price per share of Euro 13. Warrants that have not been exercised at the end of this period irrevocably become ineffective and are taken to have been extinguished as explained in the related regulations to which reference is made. At December 31, 2019, equity comprises unavailable reserves for market warrants of €19,367 thousand, of which €6,000 thousand was recognised as a decrease in the share premium reserve following the capital increase which took place on December 21, 2017 and the concurrent allocation of 10,000 thousand market warrants, and €9,367 thousand was taken as a reduction of other reserves, following the allocation of the residual 9,367,393 market warrants upon listing and the concurrent merger on August 6, 2018. The group’s objectives in capital management are to create value for shareholders, safeguard the group’s future and to support its development. The group thus seeks to maintain a sufficient level of capitalisation, while giving shareholders satisfactory returns and ensuring the group has access to external sources of financing at acceptable terms, including by maintaining an adequate rating. The group monitors the debt/equity ratio on an ongoing basis, particularly in terms of net indebtedness and cash flows generated by operating activities. The board of directors carefully monitors the balance between greater returns through the right level of indebtedness and the advantages of a sound financial position. To achieve these objectives, the group strives to continuously make its operations more profitable. The board of directors monitors the return on capital, being total equity attributable to owners of the parent, excluding non-controlling interests, and the amount of dividends to be distributed to holders of ordinary shares. On the basis of available information published by Consob (the Italian Commission for listed companies and the stock exchange), updated to December 31, 2019, the parent’s main shareholders are as follows: - GCL Holdings S.C.A. holding 24.276% of the voting shares; - PII G S.à r.l. holding 8.816% of the voting shares; - GCL Holdings LP S.à r.l. holding 5.634% of the voting shares. treasury shares will be repurchased in accordance with the additional operating limits set by EU and national legislation, including regulations, ruling from time to time and applicable to purchases; ii. the purchases shall be made in compliance with article 132 of the Consolidated Finance Act, article 144-bis.1.b) of the Issuer Regulation and any other applicable legislation, including the market practices accepted and recognised by Consob; 2. authorise, pursuant to article 2357-ter of the Italian Civil Code, the repurchase, including in more than one tranche and without time limits, of ordinary Guala Closures S.p.A. shares in accordance with the above resolution, as follows: i. if carried out in cash, at a price not below 10% of the reference price on the MTA in the session prior to each transaction; ii. if carried out as part of extraordinary transactions, including, but not limited to, exchange, swap, contribution or any other non-cash disposal, in accordance with the financial terms set by the board of directors, based on the nature and the characteristics of the transaction, also considering the performance of the parent’s share; iii. with respect to the ordinary shares serving stock option plans, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the relevant plan regulations; iv. with respect to the activities falling under the so-called ‘accepted market practice’ covered by article 180.1.c) of the Consolidated Finance Act about operations to support market liquidity, in accordance with the criteria set by Consob from time to time and, in any case, in compliance with any terms, conditions and requirements set by EU and national legislation (including regulations) applicable from time to time, to grant the board of directors and/or through its chairperson and the CEO, Marco Giovannini, and the director, Anibal Diaz Diaz, the widest powers, including the power of sub-delegation or to engage external experts, to be exercised also separately and with the widest discretion, in order to implement the Programme and the relevant purchases and sales, however in full compliance with ruling legislation and the limitations of your authorisation as resolved above.

The finance department is responsible for the monitoring and, in carrying out such activities, it uses information generated by the internal control system. _Credit risk_ This is the risk that a customer or the counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to meet an obligation, leading to a financial loss. These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables and financial investments. The group’s exposure to credit risk depends largely on each customer’s specific characteristics. The demographics of the group’s customer portfolio, including the segment insolvency risk and the country risk, have an impact on the credit risk. The group accrues an allowance for impairment equal to the estimated losses on trade and other loans and receivables. It comprises both the recognition of impairment losses for material individual amounts and the recognition of collective impairment for similar groups of assets to cover losses already incurred but not yet identified. The collective impairment losses are calculated on the basis of historical payment statistics. Most of the group’s trade receivables are due from leading operators of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage segment. Most of its trading relationships are with longstanding customers. The Group reduces credit exposure by using supplier financing lines made available by the Group’s main customers, leading to factors part of its trade receivables without recourse. The group’s historical figures indicate a modest amount of credit losses. The risk is fully covered by the corresponding loss allowance recognised in the consolidated financial statements. There are no cases of particularly concentrated credit risk in geographical terms. At December 31, 2018 and 2019, trade receivables may be analysed by geographical segment as follows: At December 31, 2019, trade receivables may be analysed by original currency as follows: - the individual cash flows are discounted using risk-free rates ruling on the measurement date. These rates are deducted from the swap rates using the bootstrap method for each expiry date of the corresponding cash flow based on the resulting time curve; - furthermore the individual cash flows are discounted using an additional rate, based on the group’s credit standing, calculated as the weighted average of the spreads applied to the different financing agreements. The spreads applied to the financing agreements are deemed to objectively represent the group’s credit standing and subsequent significant changes should not arise given its current financial position.

Accordingly, negative amounts indicate an increase in the fair value of the liability and vice versa for positive amounts. _Currency risk_ This risk relates to the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on sales and purchases in currencies other than the functional currencies of the various group entities. The group is exposed to currency risk, particularly in relation to fluctuations of the US dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Ukrainian hryvnia and Polish zloty. Interest on loans is denominated in the currency of the cash flows generated by the group’s underlying transactions. The risk of exchange fluctuations was managed in the past using currency hedges when significant differences are noted between cost and revenue in foreign currency and such differences were hedged through currency swaps. These provided for the purchase/sale of agreed amounts in foreign currency at a set exchange rate against the Euro. At the reporting date, currency hedges were in place for Pounds.

However, this risk will be able to be hedged in the near future given current developments in the listing of plastics on the international market and corresponding hedging instruments.

GmbH, German manufacturer specializing in aluminum closures. The offer is part of the competitive process launched following the voluntary insolvency proceedings commenced by Closurelogic GmbH. Subsequently, on December 16, 2019, the subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. formalised its offer, through a notary, to be exercised directly or through the incorporation of a new company, requesting and obtaining a break-up fee letter, which provided for the payment of €2 million to the bidder, should the assets be sold to third parties. In December, the Luxembourg subsidiary GCL International S.à r.l. purchased a shelf-company, Waterside XLII, which subsequently took on the name of Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH. This company was subsequently identified as the purchaser of the assets of Closurelogic GmbH, availing itself of the express right reserved in the notarial offer made on December 16, 2019. On January 2, 2020, Closurelogic GMBH, under insolvency proceedings, formally accepted the proposal made on December 16, 2019. Consequently, on February 3, 2020, the German subsidiary, Guala Closures Deutschland GmbH, finalised the purchase of all the assets owned by Closurelogic GmbH, with the exception of the shares of the Turkish subsidiary, the purchase of which will take place after completion of the step-plan identified following the due diligence. Closurelogic Gmbh was founded in 1958 in Worms (Germany) and produces premium aluminium and composite closures, specialized in the beverage and water glass bottles market. The transaction involves the acquisition of the tangible and intangible assets of the Closurelogic GmbH business, including the property located in Worms, for a total value of €7.2 million, the purchase of the raw materials and finished products inventories for an amount of approximately €5 million, in addition to the payment to suppliers for approximately €0.3 million. In 2019, the activities acquired generated a turnover of approximately 45 million euros, with most sales made in the glass-bottled mineral-water market. About 50% of these sales were realised in Germany, with the remainder spread throughout Europe. The acquisition allows the Guala Closures Group to have a significant share in the German market, where the presence in terms of mineral water has been marginal until now.
