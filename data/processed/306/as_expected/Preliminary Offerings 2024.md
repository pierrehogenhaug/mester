## Amer Sports Company 


## $600,000,000 


## % Senior Secured Notes due 2031

Amer Sports Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), is offering $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the
“notes”). Interest on the notes will accrue from       , 2024, and will be payable on       and of each year, commencing on, 2024. The notes

will mature on   , 2031.


The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after        , 2027, at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum. In addition,
some or all of the notes may be redeemed prior to       , 2027 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. If we experience a Change of Control (as defined below) or, under certain circumstances, consummate
certain asset sales, the Issuer must offer to purchase the notes at an offer price of 101% or 100%, respectively, of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. At any time prior to, 2027, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed with

the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum. At any time prior to, 2027, the Issuer may redeem up

to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes during any 12-month period at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, in certain circumstances in which the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor, as the
case may be, would become obligated to pay additional amounts under the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes.”

The notes will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Amer Sports, Inc. (the “Company”), a Cayman Islands exempted
company and the Issuer’s ultimate parent company, and each of the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a borrower or a guarantor under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) (together, the “Note Guarantors”).


The notes and the guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by the same first priority liens that secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors
under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) as described under “Description of Notes.” The notes and the guarantees will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations
and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of
payment to all of the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective future subordinated indebtedness. The notes and the guarantees will be effectively pari passu with the
Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the Collateral (as defined below) and effectively senior to the Issuer’s and
the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured, or that is secured by junior liens, in each case, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral. In addition, the notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future obligations
secured by assets that are not Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, preferred stock
and other liabilities of each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes.

We are not obligated under any registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the notes for resale or to exchange the notes for notes registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any
securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated quotation system. The indenture that will govern the notes will not be subject to the provisions of the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”).


**See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 33 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in the notes.**

**Offering Price for the notes:         % plus accrued interest, if any, from      , 2024.**

institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the U.S. in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the notes may be relying on the exemption from the
provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The notes are not transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described herein under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Certain Definitions**

All references to “U.S. dollars,” “dollars” or “$” are to the U.S. dollar and all references to “EUR” or “€” are to

the euro. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “EMEA” refer to Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, all references to “Greater China” refer to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan
and all references to “Asia Pacific” exclude Greater China.

**Financial Statements**

Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information contained in this offering memorandum is prepared and

presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Certain differences exist between IFRS and generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which might be material to the financial information
herein. We have not prepared a reconciliation of our consolidated financial statements and related footnote
disclosures between IFRS and U.S. GAAP. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisers for an
understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how these differences might affect the financial
information herein.

The audited consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been restated due to

certain changes in accounting principles, classification and corrections of errors from previously published audited
consolidated financial statements. For further information on the restatements of our audited consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 3, “Changes in accounting principles and correction of
errors,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. However, solely for fiscal year 2020, our restated audited

consolidated statement of financial position is presented as of January 1, 2021, as a result of such restatement.

Our financial information should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the notes
thereto, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

We use constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted

EBITDA Margin, which are non-IFRS financial measures, in this offering memorandum. A non-IFRS financial
measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes
amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure.

We calculate constant currency revenue by translating the current period reported amounts using the actual

exchange rates in use during the comparative prior period, in place of the exchange rates in use during the current
period.

EBITDA is calculated as net loss plus income tax expense, finance cost, depreciation and amortization and

minus finance income, from both continuing and discontinued operations.

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA with adjustments to exclude results from discontinued operations,

restructuring expenses, impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets, expenses related to transaction
activities, expenses related to certain legal proceedings and share-based payments.

We calculated Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA less the right-of-use asset amortization

expense under IFRS 16.

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

We believe that constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and

Adjusted EBITDA Margin when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS,
provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal


-----

comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may
not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of constant
currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are
helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business and
evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.

You should not consider constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported
under IFRS. Constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and have limitations as an
analytical tool. For example, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Margin exclude certain tax payments that may reduce cash available to us, do not reflect any cash capital
expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future,
do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs and do not reflect the interest expense,
or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt.

Additionally, our calculations of constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may be different from the calculations used by other companies
for similarly titled measures, including our competitors, and therefore may not be comparable to those of other
companies. For reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly
comparable IFRS measure, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” and for a reconciliation of Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA to the most
directly comparable IFRS measure, see “Summary Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
Measures.”

Furthermore, investors should note that “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA”, as defined in the “Description of

Notes” and the indenture governing the notes, is not calculated in the same manner as Adjusted EBITDA or PreIFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Financial Information With Respect to Note Guarantors**

We have presented consolidated financial data for the Company in this offering memorandum and, in lieu of the

information that would be required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, we have included elsewhere certain quantitative
data in respect of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. For so long as any notes remain outstanding, we will make
available, upon request, to any holder and any prospective purchaser of notes the information required pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Market, Ranking, Industry Data and Forecasts**

Market data and certain industry forecast data used in this offering memorandum were obtained from internal

reports, where appropriate, as well as third-party sources, including independent industry publications, such as
Euromonitor International Limited (“Euromonitor International”) and Statista, Inc. (“Statista”), as well as other
publicly available information. Data regarding the industries in which we compete and our market position and
market share within these industries are inherently imprecise and are subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties beyond our control, but we believe they generally indicate size, position and market share.
In addition, assumptions and estimates of our and our industries’ future performance are necessarily subject to a
high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. These and other factors could cause our future
performance to differ materially from our assumptions and estimates. As a result, you should be aware that market,
ranking and other similar industry data included in this offering memorandum, and estimates and beliefs based on
that data, may not be reliable. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

**Trademarks, Service Marks and Copyrights**

We own various trademark registrations and applications, and unregistered trademarks, including Arc’teryx,
Salomon, Wilson, Peak Performance, Atomic, Armada, ENVE, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield and
ATEC, among others, and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks and service marks,
including our corporate logo. Solely for convenience, some of the trademarks, service marks and trade names
referred to in this offering memorandum are listed without the ® and ™ symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest
extent under applicable law, rights to such trademarks, service marks and trade names.

remains ahead. We are excited about our future and the opportunity to drive growth in each of our three reportable


-----

segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports. Our segments comprise our “brand
clusters,” which reflect both how our consumers engage with our products and how we manage our business.

Each segment is led by one of our core brands: Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson.

**_Arc’teryx_**

Arc’teryx is a technical outdoor apparel brand inspired by the Canadian Coast Mountains and built on the

principle of obsessive, precise design and production. Arc’teryx gear pushes the boundaries of performance and
enables adventurers to excel in their outdoor pursuits in the mountains, in the backcountry and on  some of the
world’s most technical climbs. The products are known for their minimalist design and sleek and streamlined
aesthetic, along with new, innovative features that continually advance outdoor activities.

Product quality, from the materials to the design, allows Arc’teryx to command premium pricing as evidenced

by its best-selling “hardshell” jacket in North America, the Alpha SV. Overall, Arc’teryx combines beautiful,
innovative products and an authentic brand experience that extends beyond apparel, fostering communities and
bringing people together across all regions of the world who share a passion for the outdoors.

**_Salomon_**

Born in the French Alps in 1947, Salomon creates premium innovative footwear, apparel, winter sports

equipment and accessories. Since its founding, Salomon has been fueled by a culture of design, craftsmanship,
continuous innovation, and performance inspired by progress, the outdoors and athletes. The brand first produced
metal ski edges and expanded into releasable ski bindings before launching industry changing rear- entry ski boots
and monocoque skis. The brand’s leadership in winter sports helped to propel it into a diverse portfolio of sports and
products including footwear and apparel. Today, Salomon is a market leader in global trail running footwear and
premium hiking footwear, with products recognized for their performance, style, durability and sustainability. Over
60% of Salomon’s revenue for 2022 came from footwear, while also having leading market positions in its legacy
winter sports equipment categories (skis, snowboards, boots, bindings, goggles, helmets, etc.), creating a 365-day,
year-round brand serving all seasons for mountain sport consumers.

**_Wilson Sporting Goods_**

Founded in 1914 in Chicago, Illinois, Wilson Sporting Goods is a leading manufacturer of high- performance

sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. The Wilson Sporting Goods portfolio is made up of the iconic
Wilson brand, as well as Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield and ATEC. Collectively, these brands bring more

Wilson drives innovation and product excellence by leveraging learnings across the brands’ various disciplines,
including tennis, baseball and basketball, among other sports. The Wilson brand has a legacy as the top-of-the-line
sports equipment and is associated with legendary athletes, including Roger Federer, Russell Wilson and Jamal


-----

Murray. In addition, Wilson is the official partner of professional sports leagues, including the NBA, WNBA, NFL,
the US Open and Roland Garros Grand Slam Tennis Championships, as well as the NCAA, making Wilson products
integral to performance in sport. These athletes and leagues are a testament to the credibility and reputation of
Wilson’s track record of innovation and superior products.

While Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson stand tall and lead our three segments, our other brands appropriately fit

our sports-oriented portfolio. Brands such as Atomic and Peak Performance enhance our scale, competitive
positioning and diversification across sports categories. Together, our brands enable us to lead and compete in
various sports segments and drive the continued success of our portfolio.

brands to autonomously connect with consumers and develop products to drive growth. Our platform supports the
brands via scaled infrastructure and financial controls to accelerate performance. Our operations are subject to
complexity and risk consistent with being a large global organization. We believe that the size and diversification of
our platform mitigates risks and provides financial flexibility to invest prudently to meet the continuously evolving
needs of consumers, to develop competitive advantages and to drive growth across the brands through a relentless
focus on innovation. We also believe that our platform enables efficient integration, scaling and optimization of
target opportunities that fit within our portfolio, as well as critical insight to inform divestiture decisions.

We govern our brands through management across the finance, supply chain, sustainability, communication,

legal and compliance functions, among other areas. At the same time, we enable our brands through our group’s
incubator model that provides shared learnings from data analytics across the platform as well as from the
economies of scale and synergies of shared resources, including supplier services, distribution and logistics, human
resources and enterprise IT infrastructure. We further serve our brands through access to shared, centralized business
services, including customer service and treasury management functions. All together, these resources empower our
brand leadership teams to focus on serving consumers through brand, product and go-to-market strategies that drive
performance, and our global and scaled operating model enables larger, robust brand organizations to independently
flourish.

**_Deeply Committed to Sustainability_**

As a global group of sports and outdoor brands, we believe we can foster more sustainable lifestyles, encourage

mindful consumption, and promote well-being. While the sports and outdoor industry connects us with nature, we
also understand it can consume our planet’s precious resources. Together with our brands, we are focused on
managing the complex and challenging supply chains in our industry to build a sustainability culture that positively
impacts our environment and the people whose lives we touch. As a participant of the UN Global Compact, Amer
Sports Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, aims to incorporate the Ten Principles of the Global Compact and
to support applicable UN Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, we have committed to set science-based
near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets at the group level, which we intend to submit to be validated by
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

At the brand level, we are focused on sustainable business practices. For example, Arc’teryx opened five new

ReBird™ Service Centers in the United States, Canada, Greater China and Japan. ReBird™ Service Centers offer
consumers complementary repair services for their Arc’teryx gear, connecting consumers to the brand’s ongoing
focus on improving circularity, including upcycling, resale, care and repair. Arc’teryx’s sustainability program,
ReCare™, provides consumers with information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™
program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program
accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform. Salomon and Peak Performance have
reduced the need for materials and transport by using 3D product samples for sales purposes and are looking to
expand the use of 3D in consumer experiences and e-commerce. Further, Arc’teryx and Salomon have each set
brand-level near-term science-based emission reduction targets for 2030 approved by the SBTi.


-----

Our management oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy. Cross-functional operational teams

drive our efforts on sustainable business practices, led by the Amer Sports platform with participation across key
brands and functions. Working groups plan and execute roadmaps on sustainability initiatives in key areas
identified, such as climate change, circular economy, responsible procurement and supply chain, human rights, and
diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also take our responsibility for the health and well-being of our own employees
as well as the employees of our partners along the value chain seriously. Our membership in the Fair Labor
Association highlights our commitment to working to uphold human rights in our global supply chain with
initiatives to protect workers’ rights globally and drive long-term improvements through training and education,
worker engagement, and integration into sourcing practices.

**Our Transformation**

In 2019, an international investment consortium consisting of ANTA Sports, FountainVest, Anamered

Investments (an entity affiliated with Dennis J. (Chip) Wilson) and Tencent (each as defined below) acquired Amer
Sports (the “Acquisition”) with the goal of unlocking substantial underlying brand growth potential by transforming
the business model, investing in the brands, expanding geographies and developing a multi- channel strategy.
Following the Acquisition, our revenue growth has accelerated, with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of
20.4% from 2020 to 2022, while gross margins have expanded from 47.0% to 49.7% over the same time period.

**_Brand-direct Operating Model Delivering a Tailored Consumer Experience_**

In 2019, we reorganized and simplified our corporate structure to reflect a brand-direct model within our three

core segments designed to empower our brands and drive accountability. Under this new structure, the leadership
team of each brand is responsible for developing its own brand strategy and executing it end- to-end throughout the
value chain. Our segments, Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports, each focus on
specific areas of strength within the group. Each segment is in turn led by one of our top three brands. This segment
focused brand-direct model provides each brand with significant autonomy over decisions across key approved
functional areas including product innovation, design and development, marketing and sourcing as well as channel
and geographic strategies.

At the same time, we have sharpened our strategic focus on the most attractive subsectors in outdoor and sports,

driving our multi-channel strategy and the dominance of our core brands in large markets. We mobilize global
resources of the Amer Sports platform to support our brands to create a differentiated and powerful growth engine.
Since our transition to our new group structure and operating model, our brands have demonstrated strong
momentum and accelerated growth.

**_Elevated Brand Positioning_**

In 2019, we conducted consumer insight studies to enhance our brands’ understanding of their target consumer

demographics across key geographies. We expect our target consumers to be highly focused on technical
performance and premium quality, and to aspire to own and utilize the best products regardless of whether engaging
in sporting activities or navigating everyday routines. We continue to advance our products to meet our consumers’
needs, while enhancing our marketing strategies to clarify the premium brand positioning and drive a deeper
emotional connection with consumers. We leverage creative product marketing, rich digital content, brand
ambassadors and community building activities centered around the brands to create an authentic connection with
the consumer that has resulted in stronger brand advocacy and loyalty. As our brands continue to grow, we will need
to balance the risk of brand dilution with greater brand awareness, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance
our brands, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, harm to our reputation
could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain consumers and wholesale partners, employees, brand
ambassadors, partners and other stakeholders.

**_Strategic Transformation of the Go-to-Market Strategy_**

Through our brand-direct model, we have developed a better understanding of each brand’s target consumers,

which has allowed us to elevate brand positioning and customize each brand’s go-to-market strategies to develop


-----

deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers. These tailored go-to- market strategies are designed to
effectively reach target consumers and drive traffic and conversion. For example, Arc’teryx is aligned with a DTC
channel strategy because of its technical apparel product portfolio where it can leverage a retail store base to deliver
an immersive experience to consumers. Salomon and Wilson are historically wholesale driven businesses but have
an equally strong drive to connect with consumers directly. Both brands have recently increased their presence
within the DTC channel while enhancing their wholesale partnerships to further brand equity and drive growth.
Across our three core brands, our global owned retail network includes 138 Arc’teryx owned retail stores, 114
Salomon owned retail stores and nine Wilson owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023.

**_Accelerated Brand Penetration in Greater China_**

We have leveraged key learnings from our long-term oriented owners to enhance our capabilities and

performance in Greater China. As a result, we have grown our Greater China business significantly at a time when
others were facing challenges or retrenching. We now have a deep understanding of the average consumer in
Greater China and are able to deliver authentic, technical and premium products that align with consumer
preferences. Our retail knowhow, including our ability to deliver a high-end, luxury oriented in- store presentation
and execution capabilities have been upgraded significantly, allowing us to quickly identify and secure highly
attractive store locations with desirable consumer foot traffic. For example, we have 63 Arc’teryx owned retail
stores in Greater China as of September 30, 2023. The stores combined with our brand connects well with both pure
outdoor adventurers and luxury consumers in Greater China. We also have 30 Salomon owned retail stores and a
total of 67 Salomon distribution points (including owned retail stores and partner stores) in Greater China as of
September 30, 2023, up from 13 in 2019. For Wilson, we recently became the exclusive NBA provider and licensee
of basketballs, which is driving growth in the region, and the rapid adoption of winter sports in Greater China is
driving Salomon and Atomic winter equipment sales.

Our execution in Greater China has successfully increased our percentage of total revenue derived from the

region from 8.3% in 2020 to 14.8%, or $523.8 million, in 2022, and up to 19.4% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and we believe there is significant runway for growth in the region as we continue to roll- out
retail locations across our brands and scale our e-commerce platform.

**_Assembled a Talented and Innovative Leadership Team to Execute the Transformation and Growth Strategy_**

In 2020, we appointed Jie (James) Zheng as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Zheng also served as President of

ANTA Sports until 2023 and, prior to that, had a successful career in senior executive and sales roles at companies
such as Adidas, Reebok and Procter & Gamble. We also attracted key senior management leaders including Michael
Hauge Sørensen as the Chief Operating Officer, Andrew E. Page as the Chief Financial Officer and Victor Chen as
the Chief Strategy Officer. These team members bring a wealth of corporate experience from global companies
including Adidas, Reebok, Procter & Gamble, Boston Consulting Group, ECCO, Footlocker, General Electric,
Pandora and Under Armour.

Importantly, we also reset the leadership in each of our segments and infused the organization with a deep

bench of talent with experience growing global brands. We appointed Stuart C. Haselden to lead Arc’teryx and Peak
Performance. Mr. Haselden has experience with fast growing brands having previously served as the Chief
Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer at Lululemon Athletica as well other senior executive roles at brands
such as J.Crew. We appointed Franco Fogliato to lead Salomon. Mr. Fogliato has extensive outdoor experience with
large global portfolios, having previously served as an Executive Vice President of Global Omnichannel at
Columbia Sportswear with additional experience at The North Face and Billabong. We promoted Joseph Dudy to
lead Wilson. Mr. Dudy has worked at Wilson for more than 28 years and has a deep understanding of the brand
having previously served as Wilson’s Chief Financial Officer. Under his leadership, Wilson has experienced strong
growth in racquet sports, including new racquet categories such as padel and pickleball, won a contract with the
NBA to once again be its exclusive basketball provider and licensee, and deepened its relationship with the NFL.
Lastly, we appointed John Yao as General Manager of Amer Sports Greater China to closely coordinate brand
success with global teams in this important region. John previously helped lead Nike’s business in Greater China for
over 17 years.


-----

In addition to resetting our leaderships teams, we have made considerable investments to attract top- tier

industry talent across the Amer Sports group. We have attracted highly experienced and successful talent from some
of the world’s leading brands. These talented individuals bring deep industry knowledge and capabilities in key
areas such as brand marketing, product design, merchandising and DTC go-to- market strategies.

**_Rationalized Brand Portfolio_**

As part of our transformation, we performed a detailed evaluation of our brand portfolio to determine which

brands are core to our strategic initiatives. We identified opportunities to rationalize our portfolio and divested
Mavic in 2019, Precor in 2021 and Suunto in 2022. We are focused on core brands within our segments which have
large market opportunities and significant upside potential, and we have allocated our capital and resources
accordingly to achieve our strategic growth plan.

**Recent Financial Performance**

Our transformation has resulted in strong revenue growth, gross margin improvement and an increase in

operating profitability. Comparing 2022 and 2020, we achieved the following results:

  - increase in revenue from $2.4 billion to $3.5 billion, representing a CAGR of 20.4%

  - increase in gross margin from 47.0% to 49.7%

  - increase in net loss from $237.2 million to $252.7 million

  - increase in Adjusted EBITDA from $311.4 million to $453.0 million, representing a CAGR of 20.6%

Comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we achieved the following

results:

  - increase in revenue from $2.4 billion to $3.1 billion, representing a growth rate of 29.9%

  - increase in gross margin from 49.4% to 52.2%

  - increase in net loss from $104.4 million to $113.9 million

  - increase in Adjusted EBITDA from $261.8 million to $422.1 million, representing a growth rate of 61.3%

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following competitive strengths have been key drivers of our success to date and

strategically position us for continued success. Although we believe these competitive strengths will contribute to
the growth and success of our company, our business is subject to risks that may prevent us from achieving our
business objectives or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk


-----

Factors” for a discussion of these risks, which you should consider carefully before making an investment decision
to purchase the notes.

**_Iconic Leading Brands in Attractive Diversified Categories_**

Our dynamic portfolio of iconic brands is featured at the pinnacle of sports and power “winning moments” for

professional athletes and amateurs alike. Our brands are defined by innovative, excellent products with superior
quality, sustainability and thoughtful design, enabling them to be “market shapers” and leaders in intensely
competitive markets for products, services and experiences. For example, Arc’teryx produces specialty climbing and
mountain apparel worn from the foot to the peak of the Canadian Rockies, Salomon attracts the best athletes with its
footwear and winter sports equipment from the French Alps to trails across the world and Wilson Sporting Goods is
a market leader for tennis equipment, baseball gloves, baseball and softball bats, basketballs and footballs. With
multiple brands that are market leaders in their respective categories, we have a diversified, resilient portfolio. The
consistency and profitability of our hard goods categories are complemented by multiple forward growth levers,
including double digit, profitable growth in soft goods across large markets.

As a group, our brands are complementary to one another while also geographically and seasonally diversified.

We serve a wide range of global athletic and outdoor activities year-round. The relationship among our brands
positions us to outfit the outdoor athlete from head to toe. For example, an outdoor athlete can ski on Atomic in the
winter, wear an Arc’teryx jacket when rock climbing in the fall and run with Salomon shoes year round. Our market
leadership in numerous categories, combined with the diversification of our portfolio, allows us to serve consumers
around the world at all times of the year and reduces the aggregate level of seasonality across our business.
Nevertheless, changes in market trends and consumer preferences could adversely affect our results of operations.

**_Authentic Brand Connection with Consumers across Performance Levels_**

We believe our brands are individually and collectively genuine, true to the aligned group and brand values and

purposeful in delivering on promises to our communities. The authenticity of our brands connects us to sports and
outdoor enthusiasts who associate our brands with quality craftsmanship, leading innovation and a passion for
athletics and the outdoors. An Arc’teryx consumer sees a high-end climbing and ski brand while a Wilson consumer
sees it as a leader in tennis. Our credibility is supported by strong brand heritage along with professional athletes
across sports leagues and activities choosing to use our brands’ products. At the same time, our products fit and
appeal to consumers of all skill levels. This genuine brand equity helps us drive attention and traffic to our brands,
with everyday consumers seeking to align themselves with the carefully crafted brand images we have curated over
time.

Core to the identity of each of our brands is our mission to enhance consumer experiences. In doing so, our

brands foster a sense of belonging. We create thriving communities that are passionate about the sports and activities
we support and are loyal to our brands. Arc’teryx hosts community events at retail locations and in the outdoors that
bring thousands of people together in an authentic way. At ski resorts globally, Salomon, Atomic, Armada and
Arc’teryx brand awareness grows naturally as millions of outdoor enthusiasts see some of the most skilled athletes
using our brands. We believe the authenticity of our brands attracts consumers, drives brand affinity and builds a
growing loyal following.

**_Performance Products Driven by Consumer-Focused Innovation_**

Our products are rooted in innovation and technical excellence, and set the standard for quality, function and

style across their respective categories. Through a consumer-focused, design-led mindset, we emphasize
understanding and meeting the evolving needs and demands of athletes and consumers. Our innovation processes
are institutionalized through continued investment in research and development at our innovation centers. These
include the Wilson Innovation Center in Chicago, Arc’teryx design centers in North Vancouver, Portland and Tokyo
and Salomon’s Annecy Design Center in France. Our teams are constantly testing new ideas to improve our current
offering and to be the first to commercialize new products, while balancing the potential lack of receptivity of new
products, as well as shifting consumer preferences.


-----

Our brands are supported by former competitive athletes who enjoy an active lifestyle and have a desire to lean

into hard problems and apply design to create possibility. We have an expansive network of hundreds of
professional athletes and ambassadors across our brands who we actively collaborate with. We gather feedback,
insights and ideas from them to incorporate into our designs. This direct feedback drives our product innovation
engine and results in high-end products that are trusted by our consumers. We leverage advanced technologies to
constantly improve our products and reaffirm the pricing power our brands command. For example, Wilson has
driven innovation across sports including football, baseball, tennis and golf for over a century. Today, that culture of
innovation is present in each of our brands as we are using artificial intelligence to design a baseball bat with a
larger sweet spot, we have used 3D printing to create an airless basketball, and we use sensors and cameras on skiers
to improve ski edge designs. Design features across our brands include Arc’teryx and Salomon developing new,
greener membranes with Gore-Tex for their jackets and shoes, improving the waterproofing and breathability,
Salomon’s patented Sensifit footwear technology providing precise and comfortable fit in combination with the
differentiated Quicklace system and Wilson’s cushion core carcass in its basketballs designed to ensure an easy grip
for players. In recent years, design teams at our brands have also invested in the development of products, packaging
and services with a sustainability focus, such as Wilson’s Triniti™ tennis balls made of certain materials that
enhance product longevity and using recyclable packaging and Salomon’s MTN Summit alpine boot with ecodesigned features. Our products’ shape their respective categories with innovative technologies fueled by our deep
commitment to rigorous research and development.

**_Global Market Access with Scale and Global Points of Presence_**

Collectively, we are a scaled global business with diverse geographic reach and distribution. In 2022, 42% of

our revenue was from the Americas, 36% from EMEA, 7% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 15%
from Greater China. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 40% of our revenue was from the Americas,
33% from EMEA, 8% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 19% from Greater China. All around the
globe, our brands are guided by a consumer-first mindset and meet consumers exactly where they shop, in both
digital and physical spaces. Each brand boasts a multi-channel distribution strategy that is tailored to the brand’s
product assortment. For example, Salomon has strong access to key specialty retailers in remote mountain locations
where consumers buy trail running and winter sports equipment, where the customer base differs significantly from
sporting good chains. Arc’teryx is oriented towards a DTC model with next generation retail locations that
illuminate the brand identity and resonate with consumers, tailored to consumer preferences by region.

As a group, we deploy a vertically integrated, DTC mindset, while leveraging our network of strong wholesale

relationships. We are increasingly emphasizing our owned e-commerce and building out our owned retail
distribution around the world. As of September 30, 2023, we have over 330 owned retail stores and growing. Our
owned retail stores serve as attractive marketing tools that elevate the consumer experience, and, with the help of instore activations and events, enhance brand loyalty, build communities and generate a strong return-on-investment.
Our owned retail benefits our global e-commerce business, which has grown significantly across all brands, up 88%
from 2020 to 2022. The combination of our wholesale and DTC channels, along with our global infrastructure allow
our brands to connect with consumers conveniently and seamlessly around the world.

While our business and revenues are geographically diverse, this is the aggregate result of an extensive global

footprint built and expanded at the local level and fostered over decades. Today we have owned retail stores in 24
countries representing generations of investment in local communities, which allows us the flexibility to tailor our
approach to best meet the needs of local markets. We are nimble across markets and able to replicate success of new
product launches in one region globally in a short period of time given our investments in our growing worldwide
network.

**_Differentiated Operating Model Supporting Our Brands_**

Our global platform supports the brands in key functional areas such as financial controls, capital allocation,

compliance and sustainability. IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, vendor administration and communication functions
are areas in which we seek to ensure the ongoing protection of shared assets. We also serve the brands in areas such
as human resources, financial reporting, automation and continuous technological improvement. Across these
functional areas, our brands benefit from infrastructure that they would not be able to build cost efficiently as stand

-----

alone entities. The scale advantages of our platform can be observed in the over $1.4 billion in annual procurement
spend we undertake across 176 suppliers in 32 countries as well as 19 distribution centers, of which we operate 9,
globally as of September 30, 2023. In essence, our brands enjoy the benefits of access to a high-quality global
supply chain commensurate with a greater than $3 billion revenue platform. The shared resources not only create
synergies for the brands across each of our segments, but also empower them to prioritize and optimize brand
strategy and performance.

**_Proven Ability to Win in Greater China_**

Since 2018, our capabilities in Greater China have expanded as our group headcount in the region has increased

from approximately 450 to 800 employees as of September 30, 2023. We have realized significant success in the
region through a commercialization strategy specific to the Chinese market. Our leaders are empowered to make
decisions quickly so that we can compete to win in a dynamic and evolving Chinese retail landscape. While the
brand experience for consumers is consistent with each brand’s global ethos, we employ localization strategies that
resonate with Chinese consumers. For example, Arc’teryx’s loyalty program includes over 1.7 million members in
Greater China as of September 30, 2023, having grown from only fourteen thousand in 2018 due to the brand’s
ability to leverage tools such as WeChat to accelerate loyalty member enrollment.

Our strategy in Greater China also leverages a precise retail rollout combined with operational excellence. Store

locations are selected using detailed data analysis, and we are keenly focused on optimizing store size and storelevel productivity. Each location seeks to bring to life our authentic brand stories. Our operational excellence allows
us to refresh retail inventory on a regular cadence, helping to drive consistent traffic and excitement in our stores
and facilitating a luxury experience. We have already demonstrated success in Greater China, having grown our
revenue from $202.3 million in 2020 to $523.8 million in 2022, representing a 60.9% CAGR, and operating margins
in the region exceeds the margins of the business overall. Our revenue from Greater China has continued to grow in
2023, with $593.0 million revenue derived from the region for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, up from
$353.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing a growth rate of 67.6%. In addition,
while our initial success in Greater China was largely related to growth of Arc’teryx, we have developed a
repeatable playbook with Salomon, which grew its revenue in Greater China by 72% from 2021 to 2022.

We believe we are in the preliminary stages of addressing our growth opportunity in Greater China as our

brands continue to be recognized and appreciated by consumers in Greater China, while our proven ability to tailor
and execute a regional strategy highlights our global potential.

**_Highly Experienced Management Team with Deep Bench of Talent_**

Our strategic vision, operational execution and company culture are driven by our executive leadership team,

which has a proven track record in developing sportswear brands on a global scale. At the brand level, we have a
deep bench of leaders that have significant experience building DTC retail strategies and unrivaled expertise in
accessing fast growing markets. Our brand CEOs operate with a high degree of autonomy and support from group
management. Within each brand organization, we have highly talented individuals executing key functionalities,
including brand marketing, product development and operations. Across the organization, one third of employees at
the top two leadership tiers of the company are individuals hired within the last two years, allowing for fresh
perspectives to partner with experienced talent driving strong execution.

**Our Growth Strategies**

We have established comprehensive growth strategies across each of our brands, founded on the pillars of

product innovation, geographic expansion, channel mix optimization and increased brand awareness. We intend to
leverage both the intrinsic strengths of our brands and the synergistic benefits of our platform to pursue the
following growth strategies:

**_Leverage Innovation Leadership to Strengthen Core Categories and Scale Newer Categories_**

The foundation of our brands’ success comes from an ability to innovate and create products that appeal to both

elite athletes and everyday consumers. We believe our innovation model, which has been institutionalized across


-----

brands in each of our three segments, will allow us to expand our market shares within core categories, as well as
tactically scale in newer categories.

Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx employs a hands-on, iterative product development process that begins

with innovative ideas in the North Vancouver design center. These product innovations come to life via on-site
prototyping at the nearby ARC’One facility. Further, the team rigorously tests the product in the Canadian Coast
Mountains with world-class mountain athletes. This results in a product that meets our  high quality standards and
drives continuous innovation. Core innovation enables products like the Alpha SV waterproof breathable
“hardshell” jacket to consistently be among Arc’teryx’s top selling products, supporting the brand’s market
leadership within outdoor technical apparel and driving continued topline growth. Along with core outdoor category
growth, Arc’teryx plans to grow its women’s category, where it has invested in new design leadership, including an
expanded assortment, color palette and updated fits, along with rigorous engagement with female athletes to further
expand market share with female consumers. For new product development, Arc’teryx recently opened a footwear
development office in Portland, Oregon to be able to provide a more comprehensive offering to the outdoor
consumer, while also further diversifying product line seasonality. Arc’teryx is also expanding its product portfolio
through its popular contemporary urban lifestyle line, Veilance. These new categories are supplemented by
sustainability programs, including ReCare™, ReCut™ and ReGear™. ReCare™ provides consumers with
information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that
are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for
sale on the ReGear™ platform.

Within Outdoor Performance, Salomon is deeply committed to innovation in footwear, reflected by its world
class design center in Annecy, France, along with a professional athlete collaboration program to design nextgeneration products. Through trail running, Salomon has been influential in shaping the modern outdoor footwear
industry, rich in heritage of the French Alps. These innovations fuel the future of the sport, recently being worn by
Courtney Dauwalter as she set back-to-back records at the Western States Endurance Race 100-mile run, and three
weeks later, in the Hardrock 100 with the same pair of S/LAB Genesis shoes. S/LAB is the brand’s halo collection
of specialty running and Nordic ski systems which have won races from the UTMB in Chamonix France to the 2022
Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, China.

The brand’s ADDIKT PRO on-piste ski line is made with recycled ABS sidewalls, demonstrating Salomon’s

leading innovation.

Historically, innovation has supported the evolution of Salomon’s iconic products like the XT-6, which was

launched in 2013 and originally designed for ultra-distance trail runners under harsh conditions. This silhouette now
creates the foundation of Salomon’s rapidly growing Sportstyle line, which creates a blend between function and
fashion that is loved by athletes and consumers alike and represents a significant opportunity for the brand. Salomon
Sportstyle footwear has become so culturally relevant that the MM6 Maison Margiela x Salomon Cross Low shoes
have been worn by global superstars, including during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show, which was viewed by
more than 115 million people globally. Sportstyle is the fastest growing collection in the Salomon brand with
revenue over $80 million in 2022, and over $165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Salomon also demonstrates an unwavering commitment to producing high-quality equipment for winter sports.

During the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, athletes using Salomon products went on to win 28 Olympic
medals, showcasing the technical excellence of the brand’s winter sports equipment from skis, ski boots, ski
bindings, snowboards, snowboard boots and bindings. Two-time World Cup Overall Alpine ski racer Marco
Odermatt has relied exclusively on Salomon ski boots and bindings in his wins.

Salomon intends to continue leveraging its premier innovation capabilities to improve existing product lines as

well as develop new products to drive growth and increase market share.

In Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson’s in-house innovation capabilities, anchored by its innovation center located

in Chicago, provide a competitive advantage and an engine for continuous growth. The brand’s significant scale,
particularly compared to mono-sport competitors, allows Wilson to make significant investments in research and
development. The innovation process leverages key insights from technical scientists, engineers and designers who


-----

have a deep understanding of sports and the technical needs of athletes who use Wilson products. For example, as of
September 1, 2023, 27% of the top 100 men’s tennis players and 42% of the top 100 women’s players in the world
use Wilson rackets.

Other recent innovation examples include a Louisville Slugger baseball bat that uses simulation software

combined with artificial intelligence, first utilized in the golf space and then expanded to baseball, to enhance the
contact sweet spot, or the Evo NXT basketball that redistributes the weight of the ball with an advanced internal
construction, making the ball easier to shoot from long range. New product introductions accounted for
approximately 21% to 22% of revenue each year from 2020 to 2022 for Wilson, and accounted for approximately
21% of the brand’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These product innovations drive market
share growth in core sports as well as adjacent categories such as the increasingly popular games of padel in Europe
and pickleball in the United States.

As a new growth lever, Wilson is expanding its reach in soft goods categories in addition to sports equipment.

Wilson is already experiencing success with its Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy, which involves launching tennis
footwear and increasing exposure to apparel and represented 3.7% of total Wilson sales during the year ended
December 31, 2022 and 5.1% of total Wilson sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We believe
this category will continue to grow as a larger contributor to the Wilson business and help fuel broader brand
engagement.

Across segments, our plans to innovate, expand our product offering and successfully implement our growth

strategy may not be successful, and implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and
administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.

**_Further Penetrate Key Markets and Strategically Broaden Our Geographic Footprint_**

While our brands across each of our three segments have achieved global recognition, there are specific markets

where they enjoy greater prominence: Arc’teryx in North America and Greater China, Salomon in Europe and
Wilson in North America. By capitalizing on our existing global presence and leveraging our brands’ strengths, we
have a significant opportunity to strategically increase our presence in existing and new geographies by cultivating
new customer bases where there is promising market demand and ample room for growth.

Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx’s future geographic growth will be grounded in its historical momentum

in North America and Greater China, with considerable opportunity in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. In North
America and Greater China, the brand operates 48 and 63 owned retail stores, including seven and 21 factory
outlets, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. During the period from 2019 to September 30, 2023, the brand has
opened a net total of 30 new stores in Greater China, as well as a net total of 20 new stores in North America, with a
net total of three additional stores opened during the fourth quarter of 2023. In Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific,
Arc’teryx operates six and 21 owned retail stores, including two and five factory outlets, respectively, as of
September 30, 2023. The brand intends to continue developing its retail real estate portfolio in these markets to drive
brand awareness and growth. In Europe, there are retail opportunities in large metro areas such as Paris, as well as
iconic, outdoor locations across the Alps, including Chamonix, France, Zermatt, Switzerland and St. Anton, Austria,
where important community-building “mountain stores” are targeted to create authentic brand positioning.

Within Outdoor Performance, while Salomon is relatively well known in Europe, we believe brand awareness is

significantly lower in Greater China and the United States. These markets represent strong growth opportunities as
the technical performance, innovative design and premium nature of the brand’s products, especially within
footwear, align well with consumer preferences in these markets. In Greater China, Salomon has successfully
opened 30 owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023 and has plans to accelerate its retail rollout in this market.
Despite still emerging brand awareness, Salomon enjoys specialty niche market positioning in the United States,
including being well known for its winter sports equipment.

According to the Circana/Retail Tracking Service, it is the number two outdoor footwear brand in the United

States for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on dollar sales.

Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has a compelling opportunity to leverage its reputation for technical

excellence in various sports activities, stemming from its historical success in the North American market. Wilson
plans to expand its market leadership in North America while driving growth in both Greater China and Europe. In
these newer markets, Wilson plans to leverage its partnership with the NBA as well as capitalize on increasing
participation in sports and outdoor activities such as tennis. In Greater China, we believe that higher levels of
participation in sports by children, young adults and women provide an opportunity to leverage the Tennis 360
Softgoods strategy to drive apparel and footwear growth while also developing a strong brand relationship with a
large and dynamic consumer base. In Europe, Wilson plans to leverage its product authority in racquet sports to
drive market share gains in padel, which is a popular fast-growing sport in the region. Fast growing sports like padel
and pickleball are also fragmented and provide Wilson an opportunity to innovate on currently relatively
standardized equipment.

**_Optimize Go-to-market Strategies to Conveniently Engage Consumers_**

Each of our brands employs a customized go-to-market strategy that is tailored specifically to the brand’s

attributes and designed to effectively reach and captivate consumers. We remain committed to further refining and
enhancing our go-to-market strategies with the goal of expanding our market presence, fostering customer loyalty
and driving growth. Our DTC strategy will continue to require significant investment and management focus and
may present risks and challenges, while our wholesale strategy may be impacted by the strength of our relationships
with our wholesale partners.

Within Technical Apparel, for Arc’teryx, the DTC channel is the primary vehicle to engage consumers and

drives both online and offline conversions. The DTC channel allows Arc’teryx to seamlessly leverage grassroots
community marketing strategies and provides for a more agile inventory management model focused on consistent
flow of fresh product. While Arc’teryx has a selective wholesale footprint that will remain an important element in
its distribution strategy, we expect owned retail and e-commerce to continue to enable DTC to be the brand’s fastest
growing channel.

  - _Retail Brand Stores: Elevated brand stores provide a critical space for Arc’teryx to engage directly with_
consumers, showcase products and build community. Its retail store strategy has evolved to include three
differentiated store formats with square footage generally ranging from 1,000–10,000 sq. ft. With multiple
store formats, the brand has expanded its retail store network, with a focus on global retail hubs like
Shanghai and New York. The brand stores are highly productive with an average global sales per square
foot of approximately $1,474 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Brand stores generally
have been profitable with a target payback period of 24 months, with actual performance generally
exceeding targets based on our global brand store openings for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023. The ReBird™ Care and Repair centers, incorporated in several new stores opened since 2022, have
been an important element of the brand’s immersive store experience, not only to enhance our efforts in
improving the circularity and reusability of our products, but also to drive traffic and consumer
engagement.

  - _E-commerce: Arc’teryx’s digital platform is a catalyst for the business across all channels by growing_
brand awareness and serving as a global “storefront” for products and brand identity. We believe the
Arc’teryx e-commerce platform will continue to grow as brand awareness accelerates through brand and
community marketing investments, which contribute to Arc’teryx’s ability to adapt its business based on
consumer data received from this platform.

Within Outdoor Performance, we have optimized Salomon’s go-to-market strategy from a traditional wholesale

model to a modern and balanced consumer-centric retail strategy. The strategy is designed to elevate the brand by
selectively choosing premium wholesale partners, curating and segmenting the inventory assortment with them,
while also reaching more consumers on a direct basis through owned retail and e-commerce and providing engaging
consumer experiences. While the channel mix remains primarily wholesale, DTC has grown significantly from 18%
of brand revenue in 2020 to 21% in 2022 in an effort to drive penetration globally.


-----

  - _Direct-to-Consumer: The brand has a strategic retail expansion plan, focusing on the development of_
multi-sport, experiential store formats in select major global cities, such as Paris and Milan, as well as
increasing the number of Sportstyle focused stores in Greater China. For e-commerce, Salomon recently
redesigned its website with a vision to inspire, guide and equip new and returning consumers to unleash
their potential through mountain sports. We believe the platform provides an immersive and frictionless
brand experience which has led to increased traffic and conversion. We expect growth on the e-commerce
platform to scale with retail expansion as brand awareness increases and Salomon builds larger brand
communities.

  - _Wholesale: Salomon targets high-quality wholesale partners, including specialty retailers, globally to_
attract new consumers. The brand collaborates with partners to drive higher per door productivity.

Many of the brand’s specialty retailer partners focus directly on Salomon’s core competencies, including

product expertise in hiking and trail running. Within outdoor and trail running shoes, Salomon is focused on
consolidating the number of accounts and improving productivity. Within the Sportstyle category, Salomon is
similarly focused on improving productivity while expanding the number of retail partners carrying the brand’s
products. Salomon intends to further increase its number of strategic wholesale accounts in Europe, especially in
underpenetrated areas of Western Europe, as well as the United States where Salomon seeks to target top-tier
sporting goods retailers.

Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson Sporting Goods’ go-to-market strategy revolves around highly

productive wholesale relationships complemented by owned retail stores and an e-commerce platform that create
excitement around Wilson’s categories and elevate Wilson’s brand. The wholesale channel is pivotal for Wilson as
we believe many consumers prefer to shop in stores where expert recommendations are available and can be critical
to driving the point-of-sale for sporting goods. Approximately 50% of Wilson’s wholesale revenue in 2022 and in
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 came from differentiated specialty retailers. Through strong wholesale
relationships and a complementary DTC strategy, Wilson aims to continue increasing consumer engagement in the
appropriate channels. Importantly, while Wilson’s owned store footprint is expected to remain relatively small and
targeted, these stores serve as important consumer touchpoints to build engagement with the brand in high-quality,
immersive retail environments.

  - _Wholesale: Wilson’s wholesale channel comprises more than 15,000 wholesale partners globally for the_
year ended December 31, 2022, balanced between traditional and specialty retailers and smaller pro shops
and country clubs. Through internal, specialized sales teams, Wilson closely collaborates with its wholesale
partners to deliver a premium and educational consumer experience that drives brand productivity. From
2020 to 2022, Wilson meaningfully increased wholesale productivity with two of its top wholesale
partners, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy, each increasing revenue by 101% and 73%, respectively.
As Wilson continues to deliver superior products, it intends to continue increasing productivity and shelf
space with strategic wholesale partners.

  - _Direct-to-Consumer: Wilson leverages DTC channels to complement its wholesale strategy by increasing_
brand awareness and elevating the brand. Wilson has owned retail stores in strategic locations, such as New
York City and Chicago, which provide an immersive consumer experience and illuminate Wilson’s
leadership across categories. The brand’s retail strategy is complemented by a global e-commerce platform
with innovative digital capabilities, such as a direct-to-team baseball offering that leverages Wilson’s
dynamic portfolio of brands and connections with baseball academies, clubs and organizations. Overall, we
believe DTC will continue to play a critical role in driving traffic and conversion for Wilson in both the
DTC and wholesale channels as brand equity and awareness grow.

**_Grow Brand Awareness, Expand Our Communities and Increase Customer Loyalty_**

We believe efforts to drive higher levels of brand awareness and increased customer loyalty across key markets

are critical for each of our brands to achieve their commercial potential. As such, each brand has developed robust
global marketing programs that build on the authenticity of each brand through strategies ranging from “grass roots”


-----

local community activities, to large scale global on-mountain events, to sophisticated original content and social
media campaigns that leverage digital marketing.

Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx has created a reputation of authenticity and an uncompromising standard

of excellence. The result has created a passionate, loyal following for the brand. However, Arc’teryx global brand
awareness levels are relatively low when compared to more established premium outerwear brands. The brand plans
to tactically increase brand awareness and curate more passionate communities through the following global
strategies:

  - _Arc’teryx Academies: Each year, Arc’teryx hosts several global events in some of the most iconic alpine_
destinations around the world such as Chamonix, France; St. Anton, Austria and Whistler, British
Columbia. Each Academy focuses on a different mountain sport discipline and is open to the public. In
2022, these events saw over 17,500 attendees and generated 76.5 million media impressions.

  - _Store-Driven Events: Arc’teryx’s events enable the brand to connect to the communities surrounding the_
brand’s stores. These events range from design discussions, music performances, to speaker series hosted
both in-store and online.

  - _Original Content + Digital and Social Media: In 2022, Arc’teryx has produced 15 original content films_
with talented filmmakers that featured sponsored athletes. These films included examples such as
Unfinished Business, a documentary about Greg Hill summiting all 20 peaks of the Spearhead Traverse in
one day and Keep It Real, a video on the underground UK bouldering scene that provided original content
to enable authentic brand storytelling across social media channels. We believe original content combined
with digital marketing strategies will increase Arc’teryx brand awareness globally.

Within Outdoor Performance, while the Salomon brand has existed for more than 75 years, we believe there is

an opportunity to grow brand awareness globally, particularly in North America and Greater China. To drive brand
awareness, Salomon plans to use the following integrated, brand-first marketing strategy to communicate key
product stories:

  - _Television, Digital and Social Media: Using television, digital and social media, Salomon plans to_
effectively communicate its brand story to a large audience of consumers and form a deeper connection.
For example, in 2022, Salomon unveiled the new “Tomorrow is Yours” campaign aimed at inspiring a
wider, younger and more diverse audience to connect with the outdoors. We believe this comprehensive
global campaign increased brand awareness and perception globally.

  - _Brand Ambassadors: Professional athletes trust Salomon in the most demanding competitive environments,_
which is the greatest form of product validation. In total, more than 600 professional athletes across trail
running, snowboarding and alpine and Nordic skiing actively use Salomon products. These athletes provide
individual product and brand storytelling opportunities to drive awareness.

  - _Loyalty Program: In 2022, Salomon launched its loyalty program, S/Plus which allows consumers to earn_
points for each purchase, access exclusive products and receive other members only benefits. The S/Plus
program had over 1.2 million members as of December 31, 2022, the first year of its existence, and over
1.5 million members as of September 30, 2023.

  - _[Original Content: Salomon.tv originated in 2009 as the original branded content platform in sports. As of](https://salomon.tv/)_
September 30, 2023, more than 245,000 subscribers view 6-10 original and authentic stories per year
highlighting athletes, sports, products and community.

  - _Events: Salomon has developed a leading series of running events in some of the most iconic outdoor_
destinations around the world called The Golden Trail Series (“GTS”). These events are the only running
events in the world designed and developed for a global television audience. In 2023, GTS events will be
broadcasted on Eurosport across 53 countries. Salomon plans to further increase spending to add events in


-----

Japan and Greater China to complement the United States and European races, entrenching Salomon as the
leading global brand powering the sport of trail running.

Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has recently elevated its brand through consistent, cohesive brand

messaging across sports categories. Today Wilson is thoughtfully balancing product marketing and brand marketing
to engage consumers, and it intends to continue growing its brand awareness in key global markets through the
following strategies:

  - _Professional Partnerships: For more than 110 years, Wilson has been and continues to be a part of_
championship-level performance for some of the world’s best athletes and iconic sports leagues. These
endorsements and partnerships serve as a competitive advantage, providing a differentiated opportunity to
convey a story around “Play What the Pros Play.” Wilson plans to continue leveraging these partnerships
with both professional leagues and young aspiring talent across sport activities to build brand awareness
globally.

  - _Strategic Marketing: Known for product excellence across sport categories, Wilson is establishing a_
cohesive brand identity that sources and amplifies brand equity from each categories’ leadership and
authenticity, effectively shifting from category marketing to brand marketing. Wilson leverages digital
marketing, social media platforms, experiential concepts and collaborations with brands such as KITH to
deliver authentic brand and product messaging to consumers. The digital marketing strategy combines
personalized targeting, engaging content and data-driven optimization to build brand awareness and drive
consumer engagement. In 2022, the brand launched a marketing program for everyone to “Live Like an
Athlete,” which immediately increased the brand’s social media engagement. Wilson continues to build on
this brand momentum through the Wilson Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy and a comprehensive brand
campaign delivered in 2023.

**_Leverage the Amer Sports Platform to Scale All of Our Brands_**

We have laid the foundation and infrastructure to enable premium brands to thrive and scale on the Amer Sports

platform. The ability for brands to chart their own consumer-centric strategies while leveraging the global scale and
capabilities of our platform provides an opportunity for all our brands across each of our three segments to
accelerate their growth in a profitable manner. For example, Atomic and Peak Performance have an opportunity to
leverage our platform to increase their presence globally. Atomic is a leading player in winter sports as validated
through the use of Atomic equipment by some of the world’s best alpine athletes, including Mikaela Shiffrin. We
intend to leverage this professional brand halo to capture additional market share in the global winter sports
equipment industry and further extend the Atomic brand to apparel and accessories. Given its Nordic roots, Peak
Performance has a strong following within EMEA; however, there is an opportunity to expand the brand globally in
the Americas, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific.

**Our Market Opportunity**

Our brands operate across several markets, including the athletic apparel, athletic footwear and sports

equipment markets. These are global markets and form a collective market opportunity of approximately $522
billion as of 2022.

  - _Global Athletic Apparel Market: According to Euromonitor International, the global athletic apparel market_
represented $220 billion in annual spending in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.4% CAGR through
2027.

  - _Global Athletic Footwear Market: According to Euromonitor International, the global athletic footwear_
market represented $152 billion in annual spending in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.8% CAGR
through 2027.

We believe our global capabilities and presence, especially within Greater China, positions us well to drive

growth in the athletic apparel and athletic footwear markets globally.


-----

  - _Global Sports Equipment Market:  According to Statista, the global sports equipment market, which_
includes golf, outdoor, racquet, team sports and winter sports, represented $75 billion in annual spend in
2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR through 2027.

We believe the following trends influence the industries within which we operate and how consumers make

their purchase decisions:

  - _Health & Longevity: We believe one of the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is an increased focus_
on health and longevity, resulting in increased participation in sports across genders, ages and geographies.
For example, according to a survey conducted by a third-party research consulting group, approximately
50% of US consumers reported wellness as a top priority in their daily lives in 2022, an increase from 42%
in 2020. We believe this increased focus on health and longevity is a trend that will continue and will drive
consumers to purchase sports apparel, footwear and equipment to facilitate a healthy lifestyle through
sports and outdoor recreation.

  - _Increased Casualization: There has been a shift towards more casual apparel and footwear options for daily_
use, a trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. This casualization trend drives the need for products
that can offer versatility across of a variety of use cases, whether in the office, or participating in outdoor
activities. We believe our premium apparel and footwear products provide the necessary style, comfort and
technical performance to allow consumers to seamlessly transition from one activity to the next while
feeling confident throughout the day.

  - _Growth in the Premium Consumer Segment: Our brands target consumers who seek high-quality, premium_
performance products to help them perform at their best and feel confident on-and-off the court. According
to the Credit Suisse 2022 Global Wealth Report, the number of adults globally with a net worth of
$100,000 or more, which we define as the premium consumer segment, has increased from 358 million in
2010 to 689 million in 2021, representing a CAGR of 6.1%. We believe our brands and products are
positioned as premium products and enable us to capitalize on growth in the number of premium
consumers.

  - _Sustainable Consumption: We believe sustainable consumption is at the forefront of many consumers’_
decision whether to engage or transact with a brand. According to a recent third-party survey of U.S.
consumers, sustainability is increasingly influencing consumer behavior. We believe the consumer’s focus
on sustainable consumption will be a continued trend and that consumers will seek out sustainability
minded companies when making purchases.

**History**

Amer Sports Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was founded in Helsinki, Finland, in 1950, and was

listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki in 1977. In 2019, Amer Sports Corporation was acquired by an investor group
consisting of ANTA Sports, FountainVest Partners (“FountainVest”), Anamered, an entity affiliated with Chip
Wilson and Tencent and our principal shareholder, and Amer Sports Corporation was delisted from the Nasdaq
Helsinki.

(9) Includes expenses related to (1) a certain patent infringement litigation and (2) certain litigation in connection

with the divestiture of a business unit. While we face such patent litigation from time to time, the magnitude of
costs is rarely significant and this litigation expense is substantially higher than all but one other patent
litigation expense in the last 10 years. We view expenses related to these matters as outside our normal course
of operations and not representative of our expected and recurring expenses. Legal expenses for other normal,
recurring legal proceedings and other legal matters are not included in this adjustment.

(10) We granted share-based compensation to employees under our equity compensation plans during the years

ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, but did not incur any expenses related to share-based payments in periods
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, as options granted under our equity compensation plans only vest
once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the occurrence of an exit event, such
as an initial public offering, and we did not believe an exit event was probable during such time. We started
recognizing expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31,
2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based payments in our calculations of
Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that such expenses are not
representative of our ongoing expenses as they relate to recognition in a single period of incentive compensation
granted over a period of several fiscal years.

We estimate that cash and cash equivalents were $483.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $402.0

million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that loans from financial institutions were $1,863.4 million as of
December 31, 2023, compared to $1,792.2 million as of December 31, 2022, loans from related parties were
$4,186.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $4,039.0 million as of December 31, 2022, and other

interest-bearing liabilities were $381.0 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $208.3 million as of
December 31, 2022.

**_Discussion of Preliminary Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023_**

_Revenue_

We estimate that our revenue will be between $4,353.4 million and $4,363.4 million for the year ended

December 31, 2023, compared to $3,548.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue increased across
all operating segments, geographic regions and channels. Revenue was positively affected by strong growth in the
Technical Apparel segment, which was driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth, e-commerce
expansion, as well as a rebound in Greater China following the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2022. The Outdoor
Performance segment also experienced healthy growth driven by footwear, our performance in Greater China, and
the benefit of product supply normalizing following the pandemic. Ball & Racquet Sports rose more moderately as
growth in basketball and sportswear offset softer baseball and team sports sales which led to targeted promotional
actions in these categories to clear excess inventory in the fourth quarter.

_Net Loss_

We estimate that our net loss will be between $(234.0) million and $(204.0) million for the year ended

December 31, 2023, compared to $(252.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss was positively
affected by an increase in revenue and improvements in gross margin, which was partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses, higher finance costs due to increased interest rates, recognition of share- based compensation
expense and transaction costs relating to the Amer Sports IPO.

_Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA_

We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA will be between $597.0 million and $607.0 million for the year ended

December 31, 2023, compared to $453.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our Pre-IFRS 16
Adjusted EBITDA will be between $510.6 million and $515.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,
compared to $379.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted
EBITDA were positively affected by an increase in revenue and improvements in gross margin and was partially
offset by an increase in operating expenses.

**Initial Public Offering**

On January 31, 2024, our initial public offering priced and our ordinary shares began trading on the New York

Stock Exchange under the ticker “AS” on February 1, 2024 (including the proceeds from the partial exercise of the
overallotment option described below, together with the use of proceeds therefrom, the “Amer Sports IPO”). The
Amer Sports IPO closed on February 5, 2024, raising $1.37 billion in gross proceeds, and the underwriters
subsequently exercised a portion of their overallotment option to purchase additional shares, raising $102.4 million
in additional gross proceeds on February 6, 2024.

Immediately prior to the completion of the Amer Sports IPO, a portion of certain existing shareholder loans

were cancelled in connection with certain pre-IPO recapitalization transactions. The net proceeds of the Amer Sports
IPO were used to repay certain of our existing shareholder loans, after giving effect to such cancellation, and the
additional net proceeds from the underwriters’ exercise of a portion of their overallotment option to purchase
additional shares, together with cash on hand of approximately $27.4 million, is expected to be used to repay the
outstanding borrowings under the shareholder loans. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023 and after giving effect
to the closing of the Amer Sports IPO, we had $2.1 billion of outstanding debt under our existing credit facilities and
$50.0 million of outstanding borrowings under a bilateral facility.

**Concurrent Refinancing Transactions**

Concurrently with this offering, the Issuer and certain of the Note Guarantors expects to enter into a new senior

secured credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for (i) a 7-year $600 million term loan facility (the

“New USD Term Loan Facility”), (ii) a 7-year EUR 600 million term loan facility (the “New EUR Term Loan
Facility,” together with the New USD Term Loan Facility, the “New Term Loan Facilities”) and (iii) a 5-year
revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the New Term Loan Facility, the
“New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), which will initially be a $710 million revolving credit facility established
under the Credit Agreement, as we will maintain an existing $90 million bilateral credit facility entered into with
Standard Chartered Bank initially entered into on January 15, 2021. The bilateral facility is expected to ultimately be
consolidated into a single revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness” for a description of the bilateral facility (as defined therein). The New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will be guaranteed by the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that are also
guarantors of the notes offered hereby and include certain restrictive covenants, financial maintenance ratios and
customary events of defaults. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. We intend to use the borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and proceeds of
this offering to repay and terminate the outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit facilities.

In this offering memorandum, we refer to (i) the offering of the notes hereunder, (ii) the entry into the Credit

Agreement and the use of borrowing thereunder and (iii) the application of the net proceeds from this offering as
described in “Use of Proceeds,” collectively, as the “Offering Transactions.”

if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.”


-----

Note Guarantees ................................................ The notes will be jointly and severally, unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and
each of the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer)
that is a borrower under or guarantees the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. If any such subsidiary that is
organized outside of the United States is not able to enter
into such guarantee on the Issue Date, we intend to cause
such subsidiary to provide such guarantee as promptly as
practicable thereafter, and the indenture will require us to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
guarantees to be issued within 120 days after the Issue
Date. Under certain circumstances, our subsidiary
guarantors may be released from their guarantees without
the consent of the holders of the notes. See “Description of
Notes—Note Guarantees.”

Certain guarantees may be subject to certain limitations.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Collateral—Each guarantee of the notes
will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and
may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain
defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.
Applicable U.S. laws allow courts, under certain
circumstances, to avoid the notes or the guarantees and any
related security or take other actions detrimental to the
holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer
and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make
payments in respect of the notes.” See also “Annex A—
Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Security Interests.”

Collateral ........................................................... The Issuer and the Note Guarantors will, subject to certain
exceptions, grant liens on a first-priority basis on
substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets, now
owned or hereafter acquired, that secure borrowings under
the Credit Agreement, in favor of the Notes Collateral
Agent (as defined below), pursuant to certain security
documents (the “Collateral Documents”). The Collateral
will exclude certain Excluded Assets (as defined under
“Description of Notes”).

We expect to grant liens on substantially all of the
Collateral provided by the Issuer and the U.S. guarantors
(excluding immaterial real estate and real estate located in a
flood hazard area) and located in the United States on or
prior to the Issue Date, subject to certain exceptions, and to
perfect such liens by Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”)
filing on or prior to the Issue Date, in each case to the
extent perfection may be achieved thereby (subject to a
post-closing period for certain Collateral).

After the Issue Date, we will use commercially reasonable
efforts to create and perfect liens on the Collateral not
perfected on or prior to the Issue Date within 120 days after


-----

the Issue Date. See “Description of Notes—Security for the
Notes—Perfection and Non-Perfection of Security Interests
in Collateral” and “Annex A—Certain Insolvency
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests.” For more information on the security granted,
see “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.”

Certain Collateral may be subject to certain limitations. See
also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and
Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

Intercreditor Agreement .................................... The collateral agent for the notes (the “Notes Collateral
Agent”) will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the
same may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement”) with Wilmington Trust (London)
Limited (the “Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”), setting
forth therein the relative rights with respect to the Shared
Collateral (as defined under “Description of Notes”) and
covering certain other matters relating to the administration
of security interests. Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will
generally (subject to a 180-day “standstill period”) control
substantially all matters related to the Shared Collateral,
including with respect to decisions, or enforcement, and
may take actions that the holders of the notes may disagree
with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders
of the notes. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will
also include waivers of certain important rights that holders
of the notes would otherwise have. See “Description of
Notes—Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Ranking ............................................................. The notes and the guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the
Note Guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will be
subject to local law limitations:

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the

Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing
and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness
under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities;

                         - be senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and

the Note Guarantors’ respective future subordinated
indebtedness;

                         - be effectively pari passu with the Issuer’s and the Note

Guarantors’ respective indebtedness secured by a first
priority lien on the Collateral;

                         - be effectively senior to the Issuer’s and the Note

Guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness


-----

that is unsecured, or that is secured by junior liens, in
each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

                         - be structurally subordinated to the Issuer’s and the Note

Guarantors’ respective existing and future obligations
secured by assets that are not Collateral to the extent of
the value of such assets; and

                         - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future

indebtedness, preferred stock and other liabilities of
each of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the notes.

As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Amer
Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, the Issuer and
the Note Guarantors would have had $1.991 billion
aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness,
$1.941 billion of which would have been secured
indebtedness, and approximately $604 million would have
been available for borrowing under the New Revolving
Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we had no
subordinated indebtedness outstanding.

In addition, the notes and the guarantees will be structurally
junior in right of payment to all liabilities and preferred
stock of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of December
31, 2022, on a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented 19.4% of assets and 23.0% of
liabilities, to which the notes will be structurally
subordinated. For the year ended December 31, 2022, on a
non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
represented 41.6% of our net sales and 48.4% of our
EBITDA.

Certain Covenants ............................................. The indenture that will govern the notes will, among other
things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted
subsidiaries to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue

certain preferred stock;

                         - make certain investments and other restricted payments;

                         - create liens;

                         - enter into transactions with affiliates;

                         - engage in mergers, consolidations or amalgamations;

and

                         - transfer and sell assets.

These covenants will be subject to a number of important
exceptions and qualifications. In addition, at any time the
notes are rated investment grade, certain covenants will no


-----

longer be in effect for the remaining term of the notes. For
more details, see “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

Additional Amounts ......................................... In the event that certain taxes are payable in respect of
payments under or with respect to the notes or the
guarantees of the notes (excluding any taxes imposed by
the taxing authorities in the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia), the Company or the applicable
Note Guarantor, as the case may be, will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay such additional amounts as will result, after
deduction or withholding of such taxes, in holders or
beneficial owners of notes receiving the amounts which
such holder or beneficial owners of notes would have
received in respect of the notes and the guarantees thereof,
respectively, had no such withholding or deduction been
required. See “Description of Notes—Payment of
Additional Amounts.”

Optional Tax Redemption ................................. The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, in
whole but not in part, at the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
redemption date, in certain circumstances in which the
Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor, as the case may
be, would become obligated to pay additional amounts
under the indenture that will govern the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional
Redemption due to Tax Reasons.”

Governing Law ................................................. The notes, the guarantees and the indenture that will govern
the notes will be governed by the law of the State of New
York.

Transfer Restrictions ......................................... The Issuer has not registered the notes under the Securities
Act, and the notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. The Issuer does not intend to
issue registered notes in exchange for the notes to be
privately placed in this offering and the absence of
registration rights may adversely impact the transferability
of the notes. For more information, see “Transfer
Restrictions.”

Absence of Public Market for the Notes ............ The notes are a new issue of securities and there is
currently no established trading market for the notes. The
Issuer does not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on
any securities exchange or an automated dealer quotation
system. Accordingly, a liquid market for the notes may not
develop. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they
currently intend to make a market in the notes. However,
they are not obligated to do so, and any market making
with respect to the notes may be discontinued without
notice.

No Registration Rights ...................................... We will not be required to, nor do we intend to, register the
notes for resale under the Securities Act or the securities


-----

laws of any other jurisdiction or to offer to exchange the
notes for registered notes under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

Use of Proceeds ................................................. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, after
commissions and discounts and fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this offering, and proceeds from the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities to repay the
outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit
facilities. See “Use of Proceeds.”

Trustee, Registrar and Paying Agent ................ Bank of New York Mellon

Notes Collateral Agent ..................................... Wilmington Trust (London) Limited

Other Relationships ........................................... Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are
lenders or agents under our existing credit facilities and
therefore will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this
offering upon repayment of amounts outstanding under our
existing credit facilities. See “Plan of Distribution” for
more information.

Risk Factors ....................................................... In evaluating an investment in the notes, prospective
investors should carefully consider, along with the other
information in this offering memorandum, the specific
factors set forth under “Risk factors” for risks involved
with an investment in the notes.

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

The summary of loss and other comprehensive income and loss data for the years ended December 31, 2022,

2021 and 2020, and summary balance statement of financial position data as of December 31, 2022, have been
derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The summary of loss and other comprehensive income and loss data for the nine months ended September 30,

2023 and 2022, and summary balance statement of financial position data as of September 30, 2023, have been
derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, which in the opinion of our management, include all adjustments necessary to present fairly our
results of operations and financial conditions at the date and for the periods presented.

The summary of loss and other comprehensive income and loss data for the twelve months ended September 30,

2023, have been derived by adding our restated audited consolidated financial data for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 and our unaudited consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
and subtracting our unaudited consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Historical

results for any prior period are not necessarily indicative of results expected in any future period. The results for any
interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.

The audited consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been restated due to

certain changes in accounting principles, classification and corrections of errors from previously published audited
consolidated financial statements. For further information on the restatements of our audited consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 3, “Changes in accounting principles and correction of
errors,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

not incur any expenses related to share-based payments in such periods as options granted under our equity
compensation plans only vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the
occurrence of an exit event, such as an initial public offering, and we did not believe an exit event was probable
during such time. We expect to recognize expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of
the year ended December 31, 2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based
payments in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

**RISK FACTORS**

An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,

together with other information provided to you in this offering memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the
notes. If any of the following risks actually materializes or occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition or
operating results would likely suffer. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial
may also harm us and affect your investment.

This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our

actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that
might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_Our business depends on the strength of our brands, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our_**
**_brands, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected._**

Our iconic sports and outdoor brands, including Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson, Atomic and Peak Performance,

are integral to our business and to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. We believe that
the brand images we have cultivated have significantly contributed to the success of our business and are critical to
maintaining and expanding our consumer base. Maintaining and enhancing our premium brands may require us to
make substantial investments in areas such as product design, intellectual property, operations, marketing, supply
chain (including raw materials, manufacturing and distribution), sustainability, environmental, social and
governance (“ESG”), community relations, employee training and our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) and wholesale
distribution channels, including investments in additional distribution partnerships, the opening of new owned retail
stores and new owned e-commerce websites, the inclusion of products on third-party e-commerce platforms, and
other e-commerce projects, and these investments may not be successful.

We anticipate that, as our business continues to expand into new markets and new product categories,

maintaining and enhancing our brands may become difficult and require expending significant resources. If these or
similar efforts in the future are not successful, our brands may be adversely impacted. Even if such efforts are
commercially successful, they may dilute our image in our brands’ respective core markets, including apparel,
footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories. In addition, our brands may be adversely affected if our
public image or reputation is tarnished by negative publicity. Our brands currently have significant autonomy within
the structure of the Amer group with respect to the implementation of their strategic goals. Decision makers at our
respective brands could take actions that harm our overall reputation or lead to the loss of goodwill by wholesale
partners and consumers. Likewise, the reputation of our brands could be damaged by adverse publicity regarding
Amer Sports and if decision-makers of Amer Sports take actions that would be viewed negatively by our wholesale
partners, consumers or the general public. Furthermore, our exposure to social media platforms may accelerate and
aggravate such negative publicity. In addition, ineffective marketing, product diversion to unauthorized distribution
channels, product defects, counterfeit products and failure or legal limitations to obtain, maintain, protect and
enforce the intellectual property rights in our brands may threaten the strength of our brands, and those and other
factors could diminish consumer confidence in us. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our
ability to remain a leader in premium performance in the sports and outdoor industry and to continue to offer a range
of high-quality products to our consumers, which we may not execute successfully. Any of these factors could harm
our business, reputation, prospects, financial condition or operating results.

**_Changes in market trends and consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results._**

We are a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and outdoor activities and

changing design trends affect the demand for our products. Consumer preferences and, as a result, the popularity of
particular designs and categories of apparel, footwear and accessories, generally change over time. Similarly,
consumer preferences may also change as it relates to sporting equipment and protective gear, as interest in certain
sports and outdoor activities may wane over time. Our success depends in part on our ability to promptly anticipate,
understand and respond to changing apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories trends,
popularity in sports or outdoor activities and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our efforts to maintain and


-----

improve our competitive position by monitoring and timely and appropriately responding to changes in consumer
preferences, increasing brand awareness and enhancing the style, comfort, performance and/or perceived value of
our products may not be successful. If we are unable to maintain or enhance the images of our brands or if we are
unable to timely and appropriately respond to new competition, changing consumer preferences and evolving trends
and interests (including due to product lead times which make it difficult to rapidly shift sourcing and manufacturing
to align with such changes), consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated and associate our brands
with styles and activities that are no longer popular, which would decrease demand for our products. In addition, we
market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns,
including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or
if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business. Such
failures could result in loss of market share, reduced sales, excess inventory, trade name impairments, lower gross
margin and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.

**_Our products, services and experiences face intense competition._**

The sports and outdoor industry is highly competitive and fragmented both in the United States and worldwide.

We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure apparel and footwear companies and
sports equipment companies, including both private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic
and leisure apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories, some of which have more resources
or broader products lines. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of third-party
manufacturers that produce certain of our products. In addition, we and our third-party manufacturers compete with
other companies and industries for raw materials used in our products. Our DTC brand platforms, both through our
e-commerce operations and owned retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers, which sell our products
through their digital platforms and physical stores. Furthermore, we believe that our wholesale partners face intense
competition from other department stores, sporting goods stores, retail specialty stores, and online retailers, among
others, which could negatively impact the financial stability of their businesses and their ability to conduct business
with us.

Brand image and recognition, product offerings and quality, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for

advertising and endorsements), innovation and design, sustainability, distribution, pricing, costs of production,
customer service, e-commerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of
intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology, a reduction in barriers to the
creation of new apparel and footwear companies and consumer preferences in the markets for apparel, footwear,
sports equipment, protective gear and accessories constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the
competitive nature of retail, including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop, and the continued proliferation of
e-commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our DTC and wholesale operations. Some of our competitors have
significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader consumer bases, more
established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition, and greater financial, research
and development, store development, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do. If we do not
adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competition, our costs may increase, demand for our products
may decline, possibly significantly, or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products.

**_Failure to continue to obtain or retain high-quality brand partners and ambassadors of our products could_**
**_harm our business._**

We establish relationships with professional and collegiate sports organizations, athletes, influencers and other

brand ambassadors to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with
consumers. However, as competition in the sports and outdoor industry has increased, the costs associated with
establishing and retaining such sponsorships, partnerships and other relationships also have increased. If we are
unable to maintain our current associations with such organizations or our brand ambassadors or to do so at a
reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may
be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. Additionally, certain of our agreements
with such organizations are subject to renewal in the near term, and there is no assurance we will renew such
agreements on the same terms or at all. As a result, our brands, revenue, expenses and profitability could be harmed.

Furthermore, if certain brand ambassadors were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement

agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken or statements made by athletes,
teams or leagues, or other brand ambassadors, associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of


-----

those brand ambassadors, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an
adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor or non-performance by our brand ambassadors,
a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations to use and
endorse our products and brand, or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent
athletes, public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.

**_Harm to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain consumers and wholesale_**
**_partners, employees, brand ambassadors, partners, and other stakeholders._**

Negative publicity or perceptions involving us and our brands, products, vendors, brand ambassadors, principal

shareholders or marketing and other partners, or failure to detect, prevent, mitigate or address issues giving rise to
reputational risk could adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition, and
may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees, brand ambassadors, consumers and wholesale
partners, sponsorships, partnerships, relationships with professional and collegiate sports leagues and other
stakeholders. Issues that might pose a reputational risk include:

  - product liability, product recalls, and product boycotts including due to failure to obtain any applicable
professional organization or safety or performance certifications;

  - product sponsorship and brand ambassador relationships, including those with athletes and celebrity brand
ambassadors, professional and collegiate sports leagues, influencers or group affiliations;

  - public stances on controversial social or political issues;

  - our handling of issues relating to sustainability and ESG matters, including the transparency of setting or
our progress toward sustainability and ESG expectations, goals and initiatives;

  - perceptions of our or our affiliates’ supply chain and sourcing practices, including due to geopolitical
tensions;

  - perceptions of our principal shareholders;

  - our social media activity;

  - failure of our cybersecurity measures to protect against data breaches;

  - failure to comply with applicable laws, sanctions, trade or other regulations;

  - issues with management or other key personnel, as well as labor issues; and

  - any of the other risks enumerated in these risk factors.

Furthermore, the prevalence of social media and a constant, on-demand news cycle may accelerate and in the

short-term increase the potential scope of any negative publicity we or others might receive and could increase the
negative impact of these issues on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products._**

Technical innovation and quality management in the design and manufacturing processes of apparel, footwear,

sports equipment, protective gear and accessories are essential to the commercial success of our products and
development of new products. We must continue to invest in research and development in connection with the
innovation and design of our products in order to attract and retain consumers. If we are unable to anticipate
consumer preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to introduce new products or modify our existing
products on a timely basis, we may lose wholesale partners and consumers or become subject to greater pricing
pressures. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations and designs do not respond to the needs and
demands of our wholesale partners and consumers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not
effectively brought to market. Any failure on our part to innovate and design new products or modify existing
products may harm our brand image and consumer demand for our products could decline and could result in a
decrease in our revenue and an increase in our inventory levels.


-----

In addition, we believe our wholesale partners and consumers view many of our products as premium quality. If

we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems
along with a loss of consumer confidence and loyalty, and consumers may also be unwilling to pay premium prices
for such products. Additionally, if the quality of certain of our brands and/or certain of our brands’ products does not
meet expectations, that could negatively impact consumer views about our other brands and/or such brands’
products as well. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Economic uncertainty in our key markets may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which may_**
**_adversely affect demand for our products._**

Our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer

spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions and other factors such as consumer
confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession and trade wars, political turmoil, the availability and
cost of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, levels of unemployment, inflationary pressures, lower
corporate earnings and fluctuating interest, foreign currency exchange rates and tax rates.

The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in

emerging markets and developing economies. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic
uncertainty remains, including in light of the conflict in Ukraine, and with increasing inflation, trends in consumer
discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions as a result of significant increases in
employment, financial market instability, and uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions may
lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products. Consumer demand for our products may decline as a
result of store closures, an economic downturn, or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North
America, Europe, and Asia, which in turn may result in reduced orders from wholesale partners and consumers for
our products, order cancellations, lower revenue, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.
Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Inflationary pressures have and may continue to hamper our business._**

Inflationary pressures, shortages in the labor market, and increased competition within and outside the sports

and outdoor industry for talented employees may increase our labor costs, which could negatively impact our
profitability. Labor shortages may also negatively impact us from servicing any demand that exists for our products
or operating our manufacturing facilities efficiently. Further, inflationary pressures could increase other key costs,
such as the cost of raw materials, operational expenses and costs of labor, which would make it harder to operate our
business and maintain current profit margins.

**_Our financial success may be impacted by the strength of our relationships with our wholesale partners._**

Our financial success is partially dependent on our wholesale partners continuing to carry our products and the

success of these partners. A substantial amount of our sales are made through our wholesale partners, either directly
or indirectly, who may decide to emphasize products from our competitors, to redeploy their retail floor space to
other product categories, or to take other actions that reduce or discontinue their purchases of our products.
Although we believe that our business relationships with our wholesale partners are positive, we cannot assure you
that these business relationships will continue to generate satisfactory sales in the future. If any of our major
wholesale partners fails to remain committed to our products or brand, then these partners may reduce or discontinue
purchases from us, which could adversely impact our business.

If we face supply chain difficulties or other delays in our manufacturing and distribution channels and if we

cannot fill our wholesale partners’ orders in a timely manner, the sales of our products and our relationships with
those partners may suffer, and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our product lines and
our results of operations. Many of our wholesale partners also compete with each other, and if they perceive that we
are offering their competitors better pricing and support, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products.
In addition, we compete directly with our wholesale partners by selling our products to consumers through our DTC
channel. If our wholesale partners believe that our DTC channel diverts sales from their stores, this may weaken our
relationships with our partners and cause them to reduce or discontinue purchases of our products. In addition, if we
fail to accurately identify the needs of our partners, our partners fail to accept new products or product line


-----

expansions or attribute premium value to our new or existing products or product line expansions relative to
competing products or if we fail to obtain shelf space from our wholesale partners (whether by our competitors
introducing new products or otherwise), our sales, business, results of operations and financial condition may be
adversely impacted.

**_We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale partners and consumers._**

We generally do not have long-term contracts with our wholesale partners, and sales to our wholesale partners

are generally on a per-purchase basis. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we
offer the majority of our wholesale partners the opportunity to place orders several months ahead of delivery under
our pre-order program. Sales to our wholesale partners are generally on an order-by-order basis and these advance
orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with
financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. We also extend credit to our
wholesale partners based on an assessment of such retailer’s financial condition, generally without requiring
collateral. While we do not have significant concentration among our wholesale partners as of September 30, 2023,
our largest single customer accounted for 2.9% of total accounts receivable and our 20 largest wholesale partners
accounted for 27.4% of total accounts receivable. Some of our retailers have in the past, and may in the future,
experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, which have had and could have an adverse effect on our
sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.

In addition, we and our wholesale partners could face risks from a decline in the overall level of consumer retail

spending, and a weak retail environment could impact consumer traffic in the stores of our wholesale partners and
also adversely affect our revenue. Moreover, traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels have experienced low
growth or declines in recent years and recent trends have increased permanent and temporary store closures. Recent
years have also seen shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices, which may increase the difficulty for
us to retain and grow our consumer base through our wholesale partners. If and when the retail economy weakens or
as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key
markets could adversely affect the financial health of our wholesale partners, which in turn could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on highquality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing
investments by retailers.

Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in

lower sales and orders for our products. These and other risks could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our growth strategy involves the continued expansion of our DTC channel, including our owned retail stores_**
**_and e-commerce platform, which may present risks and challenges._**

Our business involves distributing products on a wholesale basis for resale through our wholesale partners and

also includes a multi-channel experience, including owned retail stores, which we operate in 24 countries, and ecommerce websites that are owned and operated by us. Growing our e-commerce platforms and the number of
physical stores we operate is essential to our growth strategy, as is innovating and expanding our product offerings
available through these channels. Sales in our DTC channel continue to grow, which may expose us to other risks,
including those relating to continuing to grow brand awareness. This strategy has, and will continue to require
significant investment in cross-functional operations and management focus, along with investment in supporting
technologies and retail store spaces. If we are unable to provide a convenient and consistent experience for our
consumers, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if our ecommerce platform design does not appeal to our consumers, function reliably and conveniently, or maintain the
privacy and security of consumer data, or if we are unable to consistently meet our brand promise to our consumers,
we may experience a loss of consumer confidence or sales, including as a result of losing repeat consumers, or be
exposed to fraudulent purchases, cyberattacks or other issues which could adversely affect our reputation and results
of operations. Our growth in the DTC channel may also negatively impact our relationships with existing wholesale
partners.

As of September 30, 2023, we operate our e-commerce digital platforms in approximately 20 countries, where

we generally also operate in through our wholesale channel, and we are planning to expand our e-c ommerce
platform to other geographies. Existing and additional countries may impose different and evolving laws governing


-----

the operation and marketing of e-commerce websites, as well as the collection, storage and use of information on
consumers interacting with those websites. We may incur additional costs and operational challenges in complying
with these laws, and differences in these laws may cause us to operate our businesses differently in different
territories. If so, we may incur additional costs and may not realize benefits from our investment in our international
expansion. We are also exposed to the risk of fraudulent domains or websites pretending to sell our products, when
they are in reality phishing websites or imitator domains, and we might be unable to stop those websites from
operating in due time, or permanently due to regulatory or factual constraints.

**_Our revenues depend in part on the success of our retail stores, including related to volume of traffic to its_**
**_stores and the availability of suitable lease space._**

A portion of our revenues are DTC sales through stores operated by our brands. In order to generate consumer

traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations generally within successful retail shopping centers or in
fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area
to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our
ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to
earn a reasonable return. We cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or
cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with other retailers for
prominent locations; or the success of individual shopping centers or districts. As we seek to expand the number of
our brands’ retail stores, we may spend significant time and resources exploring locations that are not suitable or that
we are unable to secure, whether due to financing, political constraints, or other factors. We may be unable to
successfully open new store locations in existing or new geographies in a timely manner, if at all, which could harm
our results of operations. Existing store locations may also become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume,
consumer traffic and profitability generally may be harmed by, among other things: economic downturns in a
particular area, competition from nearby retailers, changing consumer demographics in a particular market,
changing lifestyle choices of consumers in a particular market, and the closing or decline in popularity of other
businesses located near our stores. Changes in areas around our store locations that result in reductions in consumer
foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales, business and results of operations to
be less than expected. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for
new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability could be
harmed.

Additionally, as we grow our retail store footprint, there is a risk that we will increase sales in retail stores at the

expense of our wholesale business and/or our e-commerce DTC sales. All of these factors may impact our ability to
meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

**_We face risks associated with the acquisition and divesture of businesses._**

We have expanded our products and markets in part through strategic acquisitions and may continue to do so in

the future, depending on our ability to identify and successfully pursue suitable acquisition candidates. Acquisitions
involve numerous risks, including risks inherent in entering new markets in which we may not have prior
experience; potential loss of significant customers or key personnel of the acquired business; not obtaining the
expected benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis or at all; managing operations in new geographies; and
potential diversion of management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Acquisitions may also
cause us to incur debt or result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, write-offs of goodwill and substantial
amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. We may not be able to obtain financing for future
acquisitions on favorable terms, making any such acquisitions more expensive. Any such financing may have terms
that restrict our operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired businesses
into our operations and achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions, and certain acquisitions or divestitures
may not have the desired effect of enhancing the status of our portfolio of brands. Our acquisitions and our
divestitures have in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, exposure to contingent or unexpected
liabilities, such as litigation, indemnification claims, regulatory claims and earn-out obligations.

We may not consummate a potential acquisition for a variety of reasons, but still incur material costs in

connection with an acquisition that we cannot recover. The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired
businesses or achieve the expected benefits of strategic acquisitions in the future, or consummate a potential
acquisition after incurring material costs, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position.


-----

In addition, we have divested, and may divest in the future, businesses, brands and assets as part of ongoing

efforts to refine our portfolio and redefine our strategic priorities. These divestitures may adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of
revenue associated with the divested businesses, brands or assets or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or
cost savings from the divestitures. Furthermore, businesses, brands or assets under consideration for, or otherwise
subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to completion of the divestiture, which could adversely affect
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our plans to innovate, expand our product offerings and successfully implement our growth strategies may not_**
**_be successful, and implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative_**
**_resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability._**

Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our growth strategies, including

expanding our brands’ product offerings to capture additional market share, continuing to engage in consumer
acquisition and retention efforts that drive long-term consumer and wholesale partner relationships and continuing to
grow our business. Our ability to implement these growth strategies depends, among other things, on our ability to:

  - expand our product offerings;

  - increase our brand recognition by effectively implementing our multi-channel strategy alongside our
network of wholesale partner relationships without compromising our premium consumer experience;

  - expand the geographic reach of our brands;

  - increase consumer engagement with our digital platforms;

  - leverage our investments in our human capital and operational infrastructure to drive traffic and consumer
acquisition;

  - expand and diversify our wholesale channel while continuing to expand our DTC channel, including
increasing our number of retail stores;

  - enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with potential distributors of our products in order
to better influence consumer experience at better cost efficiency and manage risks associated with thirdparty distributors; and

  - develop and grow our own manufacturing facilities, third-party sourcing and logistics footprint.

  - The principal risks to our ability to successfully carry out our plans to expand our product offering include:

  - if our expanded product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our distinctive brand identities and premium
quality, our brand images may be diminished, and our sales may decrease;

  - our innovations in apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories may fail to be
financially viable or may not be well received by our consumers or the market;

  - implementation of our plans may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business and
place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems;

  - entrance into joint ventures may face risks related to governance of the venture, strategic misalignment,
termination or exit, among others; and

  - incorporation of novel materials or features into our apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear
and accessories may not be accepted by our consumers or may be considered inferior to similar products
offered by our competitors.

Moreover, our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies and carry out our plans to expand our

product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns
and changes in consumer preferences and styles. We may invest in technology, infrastructure, new businesses,


-----

product offerings and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing business, such as our DTC operations,
and such significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business
or expanding an existing business. These plans could be abandoned, could cost more than anticipated, could impact
the quality of our products and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could
negatively impact our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.

Expanding our product offerings may also require that we develop additional in-house manufacturing

capability, either by expanding our existing manufacturing facilities or building new facilities. There is a risk that we
will be unable to develop and maintain the capacity or other capabilities necessary for us to implement our business
plan. Additionally, we may need to hire additional employees as we scale our operations or increase the size of our
retail footprint and otherwise pursue our growth strategies. We may face difficulties and added expenses increasing
the number of employees in the current market, due to factors such as wage inflation and a limited labor market,
among others. If we are unable to scale our manufacturing capability and increase the number of employees to meet
our expected growth, we may be unable to provide for appropriate supply of products in a timely manner and on a
cost-effective basis and meet consumer demand for customer service, and as a result, our revenue and results of
operations would be affected adversely.

**_Counterfeit or “knock-off” products may siphon off demand we have created for our brands’ products, and_**
**_may result in consumer confusion, harm to our brands, a loss of our market share, and/or a decrease in our_**
**_results of operations._**

We face competition from counterfeit or “knock-off” products manufactured and sold by third parties that

infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights, as well as from products that are
inspired by our brands’ products in terms of design and style, including private label offerings by retailers. In the
past, third parties have established websites to target users on social media platforms with “look alike” websites
intended to trick users into believing that they were purchasing our brands’ products at a steep discount. Some
individuals who actually made purchases from such “look alike” websites believed they had purchased from our
actual website and subsequently submitted complaints to us.

These activities of third parties may result in consumer confusion, require us to incur additional administrative

costs to manage consumer complaints related to counterfeit goods, divert consumers from us, cause us to miss out
on sales opportunities, and result in a loss of our market share. We could also be required to increase our marketing
and advertising spend. If consumers are confused by these other products and believe them to be actual products
sold by our brands, we could be forced to deal with dissatisfied consumers who mistakenly blame us for poor
service or poor-quality goods.

In addressing these or similar issues in the future, we may also be required to incur substantial expense to

protect our brands and enforce our intellectual property rights, including through legal action in the United States or
in foreign countries, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

These and similar “counterfeit” issues could reoccur and could again result in consumer confusion, harm to our

brands, a loss of our market share, and/or a decrease in our results of operations.

**_Certain of our brands’ products carry warranties, which may result in an increase to our expenses in the event_**
**_of warranty claims._**

Many of our brands’ products are generally used in outdoor activities, sometimes in severe conditions. Product

recalls or product liability claims resulting from the failure, or alleged failure, of our brands’ products could have a
material adverse effect on the reputation of our brands and result in additional expenses.

Many of our brands’ products also carry warranties for defects in quality or workmanship. The Company

provides product warranties on many products. Many of these product warranties are limited in time to one to two
years, but certain of our brands issue longer warranties on specific products. For example, Arc’teryx provides
warranties on its packs, accessories and apparel for the “Practical Product Lifespan” which can be an extended
period, such that warranty claims for such products may be brought many years after the product was sold. We
maintain a warranty reserve for estimated future warranty claims, but the actual costs of servicing future warranty
claims may exceed the reserve which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business._**

The majority of our products are sourced from a network of suppliers, predominantly in the Asia Pacific region,

including Greater China, with the remaining from EMEA, and the Americas, and our products are sold around the
world. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad,
which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political
unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which
our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the changes to the legal and
regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom (the “UK”) and its relationship with the European Union
(the “EU”), as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the United States and
elsewhere, as further described below under “—Risks Related to Our Financial, Accounting and Tax Matters—We
could be subject to changes in tax laws, tax regulations and tax treaties, including their interpretation and
application, in the Cayman Islands, Finland, Germany, the United States, the PRC, or any other country in which we
operate, which could result in additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate” and “—Risks
Related to Litigation and Regulation—Changes to trade policies, tariffs, import/export regulations and anticompetition regulations in the United States, EU, PRC and other jurisdictions, or our failure to comply with such
regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of
operations.” We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales in the People’s Republic of China (the
“PRC” and only in the context of describing PRC laws, regulations and other legal or tax matters in this offering
memorandum, excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). See “—We face risks associated with our business in the
PRC.” There could be legislative actions limiting outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign
jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States, which may
require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our ability to sell products in certain markets, demand for our products in certain markets, our ability to collect

accounts receivable, our or our third-party manufacturers’ ability to procure raw materials or manufacture products,
distribution and logistics providers’ ability to operate, our ability to operate brick and mortar stores, our workforce,
and our cost of doing business (including the cost of freight and logistics) may be impacted by these events should
they occur and changing laws and regulations. Our exposure to these risks is heightened in the PRC, where a
significant portion of our third-party manufacturing is located. Should certain of these events occur in the PRC, they
could cause a substantial disruption to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics and public health crises,

terrorist acts and political or military conflict, such as the conflict in Ukraine, have increased the risks of doing
business abroad. Such political and economic instability, and any resulting negative sentiment toward the countries
where we operate, sell or have our products manufactured, could interrupt our ability to operate internationally.
These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to
import finished products, our ability to move and store products, our ability to sell products in international markets
and our cost of doing business.

**_We face risks associated with our business in the PRC._**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, 14.1% of our revenue was derived from sales in the PRC. In addition to

our sales activity, we have key suppliers and manufacturing facilities in the PRC, and approximately 33% of our
products sourced from third-party suppliers were manufactured in the PRC in 2022. Additionally, ANTA Sports, our
largest shareholder, has significant operations in the PRC and has a principal place of business in the PRC, as well
as management and directors that are PRC citizens or domiciled in the PRC. As a result, our business is subject to
risks associated with doing business in the PRC, including but not limited to, a general climate of economic,
political and social conditions, including with respect to future regulatory, policy and legislative developments,
increased costs and uncertainties associated with enforcing contractual obligations in the PRC and increasingly
strengthening intellectual property protection system in the PRC, each of which could adversely impact our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

The PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic

reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate
governance in business enterprises, and such measures and policies relating to such measures are evolving and


-----

subject to change. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of companies with
Chinese operations to conduct their business. The PRC government has recently published new policies that
significantly affected certain industries and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release
additional regulations or policies that directly or indirectly affect the sports and outdoor industry or require us to
seek additional permission to continue our operations, which could result in a material adverse change in our
operation.

The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, where prior court decisions have limited

precedential value. The PRC legal system is evolving rapidly, and the interpretations and enforcement of many laws,
regulations and rules involves uncertainties. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage
economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese
economy but may have a negative effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies in
the PRC governing the regulation of our products, tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental
regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property or financial regulation may have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

More broadly, while the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has

been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic
conditions in the PRC, in the policies of the PRC government or in the laws and regulations in the PRC could have
an adverse effect on the overall economic growth of the PRC. Such changes could also adversely affect our business
and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our competitive position. In
addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of any other countries or regions, such as increased duties or
tariffs on imports from the PRC, may adversely affect our business. For more discussion of the risks related to our
Chinese operations, see “—Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation—There remain some uncertainties as to
whether we will be required to obtain approvals from PRC authorities to list on the U.S. exchanges and offer
securities in the future, and if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval.”

**Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers**

**_Our business or our results of operations could be harmed if we or our wholesale partners are unable to_**
**_accurately forecast demand for our products or if we are unsuccessful at managing product manufacturing_**
**_decisions._**

To ensure adequate inventory supply, we and our wholesale partners forecast inventory demand, which is

subject to many factors, including seasonal and quarterly variations, changing consumer preferences or product
trends, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, declines in overall
consumer spending, and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
Like our competitors, we have an extended design, development, manufacturing and logistics process, which
involves the initial design and development of our products, the purchase of raw materials, the production of
finished goods, the accumulation and subsequent sale of inventories, and the collection of the resulting accounts
receivable. This production cycle requires us to incur significant expenses relating to the design, development,
manufacturing, distributing and marketing of our products, including product development costs for new products,
in advance of the realization of any revenue from the sale of our products, and results in significant liquidity
requirements and working capital fluctuations throughout our fiscal year. Because the production cycle typically
involves long lead times, which requires us to make manufacturing decisions several months in advance of an
anticipated purchasing decision by the consumer, it is challenging for us to estimate and manage our inventory and
working capital requirements, and as such challenges have been, and could in the future be, exacerbated by global
supply chain issues. If we fail to accurately forecast demand or our inventory and working capital requirements, we
may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver through our DTC channel and to our
wholesale partners. In addition, our wholesale partners may fail to accurately forecast the demand for our products
and may purchase an insufficient amount of our products or may accumulate excess inventory, each of which could
negatively impact our business, brand and results of operations.

If we underestimate the demand for our products, we may not allocate sufficient budgetary resources and may

not be able to produce or source products to meet our wholesale partner requirements, and this could result in delays
in the shipment of our products and our failure to satisfy demand, as well as damage to our reputation and wholesale
partner relationships. If our wholesale partners underestimate the demand for our products, they may not have
enough products on hand to satisfy demand in a timely fashion and sales opportunities may be lost. If we or our


-----

wholesale partners overestimate the demand for our products, we or our wholesale partners could face inventory
levels in excess of demand, which could result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess
inventory at discounted prices, which would harm our gross margins and our brand management efforts. The
difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows from period
to period, which could result in the misallocation of our resources. In addition, these and other factors, including
failures to accurately predict the level of demand for our products and future revenue, costs and cash flows, could
cause a decline in revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

**_The operations of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond_**
**_our control, including those that may result in significant disruptions in supply, and that could harm our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We rely on our suppliers and, while we have multiple suppliers available for the majority of our product

components, certain of our suppliers are the sole source for specific components of our apparel, footwear, sports
equipment, protective gear and accessories. For example, Gore-Tex is used in certain Arc’teryx, Salomon, Peak
Performance and Atomic products, with Arc’teryx products representing 90.4% of our total spend on Gore-Tex and
Salomon, Peak Performance and Atomic products representing 3.8%, 5.4% and 0.4%, respectively for the year
ended December 31, 2022. We have in the past experienced significant disruptions as a result of global supply chain
issues and there can be no assurance that there will not be a further disruption in the supply of raw materials or other
products from current suppliers or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers
of materials or products of comparable quality at an acceptable price, in a timely manner or at all. Identifying a
suitable supplier is a resource-intensive process that requires us to become satisfied with their technical capabilities,
quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance and labor and other ethical
practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or component sources, we may
encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and
manufacturers in our methods, products, and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also
arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other
participants in our supply chain. In addition, freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide as there is much
greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment.

The majority of our manufacturing and finished goods as well as raw material suppliers are located outside the

United States. In addition, we work with select third-party distributors, especially in the initial stages of expansion
for highly complicated products and in new markets, and because we ultimately do not control those third parties,
we are subject to additional risks as a result of such relationships. Moreover, in 2022 approximately 33% of our
apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories products sourced from third-party suppliers
were manufactured in the PRC, with the remainder being produced in other Asian countries, North America and
Europe. We experienced disruptions to our footwear business due to COVID-19 lockdowns adversely affecting
certain of our suppliers in Asia. Many of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers. As a result of
our international suppliers and third-party manufacturers, we are subject to risks associated with doing business in
multiple jurisdictions, including:

  - political unrest, terrorism, labor disputes and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from
foreign countries in which our products are manufactured;

  - wholesale partner or consumer boycotts due to ethical, environmental or political issues in certain countries
we do business with, such as for example, human rights and labor concerns in Asia, or product-related
environmental concerns;

  - compliance with existing and new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions and
workplace safety, environmental protection, chemical regulation, quality and safety standards,
sustainability, ESG, transparency (the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and other related
EU directives or regulations), imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade
restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds;

  - risks associated with doing business in or with the PRC, including as a result of the trade conflict, or other
conflicts, between the United States and the PRC;


-----

  - reduced protection for intellectual property rights, including patent and trademark protection, in some
countries;

  - disruptions or delays in shipments and supply chains globally; and

  - changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers, wholesale partners
or consumers are located.

In particular, compliance with the sanctions and customs trade orders could affect the sourcing and availability

of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Our ability to successfully
import such materials may be adversely affected by changes in jurisdictions’ laws. See “—Increasing restrictions or
additional requirements on products from certain areas, such as the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, may
require us to incur additional costs, disrupt our value chain, or otherwise adversely impact our operations and
financial condition.” There are also increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies proactively
monitor the environmental and social performance of their value chain, including compliance with a variety of labor
practices and human rights considerations, as well as consideration of a wider range of potential environmental and
social matters, including the end-of-life considerations for products. For example, various jurisdictions have
adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that would require organizations to, among other things, conduct
due diligence to identify certain environmental and human rights risks in their supply chains and take steps to
mitigate any such risks identified. We have been and may continue to be subject to costs associated with such
regulations, as well as any future regulations on the provenance of products or their component parts or materials,
including for the diligence pertaining to these matters and the cost of remediation and other changes to products,
processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The impact of such regulations may
result in a limited pool of acceptable suppliers, and we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain products in
sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Additionally, because our supply chain is complex, we may face
regulatory challenges in complying with applicable sanctions and trade regulations and reputational challenges with
our consumers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the materials used in the
products we sell. Even if we comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to additional expectations and
scrutiny from investors, business partners, wholesale partners, consumers or other stakeholders on our
environmental and human rights practices. These expectations are evolving quickly, and their application can
involve substantial subjective determinations based on the context of specific circumstances. As such, certain of our
actions or decisions, either currently or in the future, may be perceived to not align with best practices or stakeholder
expectations, which could damage our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business.

We also face risks from potential employment shortages for our supply operations as potential employees in

certain geographies pursue opportunities outside of our and our suppliers’ industries. Any potential employment
shortages may increase costs for our supplier and manufacturing partners and may limit our ability to scale our
warehouse and factory operations efficiently. Increased costs in production may limit our profitability and may
adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

These and other factors beyond our control could interrupt our suppliers’ production in offshore facilities,

influence the ability of our suppliers to export our products cost-effectively or at all and inhibit our suppliers’ ability
to procure certain materials, along with delays, interruptions or increased costs in supply or manufacturing of our
goods, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Increasing restrictions or additional requirements on products from certain areas, such as the U.S. Uyghur_**
**_Forced Labor Prevention Act, may require us to incur additional costs, disrupt our value chain, or otherwise_**
**_adversely impact our operations and financial condition._**

Various jurisdictions where we import or sell our products have imposed restrictions on, or additional

requirements for, products based on their provenance or the origins of certain of their component parts. For
example, in December 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (the “UFLPA”),
which act imposes a presumptive ban on the import of goods to the United States that are made, wholly or in part, in
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the “XUAR”) or by certain other designated persons and entities. The
XUAR is the source of large amounts of cotton and textiles for the global apparel and footwear supply chain.
Although our policy is to prohibit the use of forced labor in our supply chain, we have previously been and may in
the future be subject to allegations that our products contain components or raw materials from the XUAR and we
cannot assure you that our affiliates may not also be subject to similar allegations. Furthermore, the U.S. Customs


-----

and Border Protection (the “CBP”) issued a region-wide withhold release order (“WRO”) in January 2021, imposing
import restrictions on cotton products produced in the XUAR. As a result of the UFLPA and WRO, materials we
import into the United States have in the past been, and could in the future be, held by the CBP based on a suspicion
that they originated from the XUAR or that they may have been produced by suppliers accused of participating in
forced labor, pending our providing clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. While the UFLPA has not had a
material impact on our results of operations, overcoming the presumptive ban in the UFLPA can be a time- and
information-intensive process, which may require additional costs and can ultimately be unsuccessful. Even if such
costs are incurred, we may not always be able to obtain sufficient information.

Such a process could result in a delay or complete inability to import such materials (including potentially non
cotton materials), which could result in inventory shortages or greater supply chain compliance costs. We could also
be subject to penalties or fines if our imports are found to have been in violation of the UFLPA or other customsrelated laws and regulations. Even if we are not subject to any fines or penalties, any perceived link between our or
our principal shareholder’s products and the XUAR, designated entities, or labor practices not in keeping with
industry expectations may result in increased costs, affect our business and damage our reputation. Moreover,
compliance with the UFLPA or other similar current or proposed requirements, including the European Union
Forced Labor Ban Proposal, may have other effects on the global supply chain, the price and scarcity of traceable
cotton or other materials of focus, and could lead to increases in our cost of goods sold, which may adversely impact
our profitability.

**_The cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and cause our results of operations and_**
**_financial condition to suffer._**

The raw materials used in our supply chain include synthetic fabrics and natural products, including blend

fabrics, nylon, polyester, down and cotton, as well as plastics, rubber, carbon and metals. Significant price
fluctuations, including as a result of inflation, or shortages or the cost of these raw materials may increase our cost
of goods sold and cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.

Additionally, increasing costs of labor, freight and energy could increase our and our suppliers’ cost of goods. If

our suppliers are affected by increases in their costs of labor, freight and energy (for example, because of rising
global energy prices, increased global worker shortages impacting shipping and ports, truck driver shortages,
increased congestion or other disruptions affecting the global distribution chain), they may attempt to pass these cost
increases on to us. If we pay such increases, we may not be able to offset them through increases in our pricing,
which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.

**_Our business is subject to risks due to our reliance on third-party manufacturers._**

We rely upon third-party manufacturers, which we do not own or operate, for the sourcing of certain of our

products, including apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories including helmets, goggles,
poles, tennis rackets, baseball bats, boots and balls, among others. Our ability to meet our wholesale partners’ and
our consumers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our third-party
manufacturers. While our agreements with our suppliers are generally fixed price arrangements on a purchase order
basis that renew annually, if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or
significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, or be unable to
perform, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have an adverse effect
on our business operations, sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our third-party
manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us
product in accordance with our plans, it could result in lost sales, added costs and distribution delays that could harm
our business and wholesale partner and consumer relationships.

Certain of our third-party manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product.

Such third-party manufacturers may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such
that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce. If, in the future, the relevant
products are again in demand and the specialized third-party manufacturers no longer exist, we may not be able to
locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all, which could have an
adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations.


-----

**_If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our brands’ products to the market_**
**_could be adversely affected._**

We rely on leased and owned Amer Sports-operated distribution facilities, as well as an ANTA Sports

distribution facility in the PRC and certain third-party facilities, to warehouse and ship product to our wholesale
partners and consumers. Our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which
may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and
hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of our brands’ products are
distributed from a relatively small number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes,
floods, fires or other natural disasters or other events outside our control affecting our warehouses or distribution
centers, including political or labor instability. Additionally, since we share distribution warehouses among brands, a
disruption at one distribution center may impact deliveries and shipments for numerous brands. We maintain
business interruption insurance under our property insurance policies, but it may not adequately protect us from the
adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. In addition, our
distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation
of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to
meet consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be
materially adversely affected.

We distribute our products to our wholesale partners and consumers directly from the factory and through

distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet consumer expectations, manage inventory,
complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, depends on the proper operation of our
distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely
performance of services by third parties, including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution
facilities. In addition, our property damage, business interruption and other insurance policies may not adequately
protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions to our distribution facilities. Any negative impacts
to our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_The success of our business depends, in part, on competent employees including key personnel as well as our_**
**_ability to maintain our workplace culture and values._**

Our success depends in part on the continued service of competent employees, including key executive officers

and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these
individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to
recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our
strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in the sports and outdoor industry is intense and we may not be
successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or
adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some
flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be
perceived as favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract,
hire and retain our employees. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and
we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to
preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit
employees.

Some employees at our own manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are subject to collective bargaining

agreements. For example, the employees at our Wilson brand Ohio manufacturing facility as well as the employees
at our facilities in Austria, France and Germany, are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Labor disputes
with these employees may have a material adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by
wholesale partners or consumers, inability to fulfill potential e-commerce demand, unanticipated inventory
accumulation and reduced revenue and net income. In addition, if we fail to mitigate labor disputes, fail to properly
hire and dismiss employees as needed or fail to comply with labor laws, which differ by location and jurisdiction
and are rapidly changing, our risk of litigation may increase, which would cause us to incur additional costs.

We have not obtained key person life insurance policies on any members of our senior management team. As a

result, we would not be protected against the associated financial loss if we were to lose the services of members of
our senior management team.

**_Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business_**
**_and results of operations._**

A significant majority of the scientific community has concluded that increased levels of carbon dioxide and

other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, potentially at a
growing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather (including precipitation and temperature) patterns
and increasingly frequent, prolonged, and/or more intense extreme weather and climate events. For more
information, see “—Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results
and financial condition.” Climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of
water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in
regulations or consumer preferences, or changes in the availability and/or cost of capital and insurance, which could
in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, governmental authorities in various
countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislation and regulation to reduce or mitigate the
impacts of climate change. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of
climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such
regulations. Failure to monitor, adapt, build resilience and develop solutions against the physical and transitional
impacts from climate change, including any differences between what climate impacts we believe may occur and
ultimately come to pass (including the timeframes associated with same), may negatively impact our brand and
reputation, sales of our products and our results of operations.

**_Sustainability- or ESG-related matters, climate change, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may_**
**_have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations._**

There has been increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, wholesale partners and

consumers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability- and
ESG-related matters, including climate change, responsible sourcing, animal welfare, deforestation, the use of
plastic, energy and water, biodiversity and other natural capital impacts, human rights, ethics, the recyclability or
recoverability of packaging, circular economy and pollution prevention considerations, materials transparency and
banning of certain chemicals and product subcomponents, and employee and director diversity, any of which may
require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence, recruiting and reporting. Further, some
investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders,
current and prospective employees, and consumers have focused increasingly on sustainability- and ESG-related
practices. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the environmental and social cost
and related risks of their investments. Certain of these parties also use certain ESG ratings in their assessment of
organizations, and unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to negative sentiment towards us. If our ESG practices do not
meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand,
reputation, share price, access to and cost of capital, and employee, wholesale partner, consumer, and/or business
partner retention may be negatively impacted.

In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to

continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the management of sustainability- or ESGrelated topics, or disclosures on such matters. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to
the regulation of climate change and other ESG matters and disclosure of related information, which could increase
the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. For example, we may be subject to
the disclosure requirements of the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (and its implementing laws
and regulations) and other EU directives or EU and EU member state regulations, the International Sustainability
Standards Board’s sustainability and climate disclosure standards, various disclosure requirements (such as
greenhouse gas metrics, climate risks, use of offsets, and emissions reduction claims) from the State of California as
well as the SEC’s climate disclosure proposal, if finalized, among other regulations or requirements; these
regulations and requirements may not entirely align and thus require us to duplicate certain or make different efforts
or use different reporting methodologies in order to comply with each jurisdictions’ requirements. Separately,
various regulators have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations on environmental marketing claims,
including but not limited to the use of “sustainable,” “eco-friendly,” “organic,” “recyclable” or similar language in
product marketing. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment,
may require us to incur additional costs for the collection of data and/or preparation of disclosures and associated
internal controls for same, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our
products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and
financial condition.

We also may at times engage in certain voluntary initiatives or commitments (such as voluntary disclosures,

certifications, or targets, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products. However, such
initiatives or commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, execution of these
strategies and achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our
control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to set relevant, achievable and
credible goals, execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected
timeframes; the availability and cost of raw materials and renewable energy; unforeseen production, design,
operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments,
including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon
sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional
regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon costs or climaterelated goals, or to other sustainability or ESG matters; adapting products to consumer preferences and consumer
acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. As a
result, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our sustainability
and ESG-related goals, which could damage our reputation and wholesale partner, consumer and other stakeholder
relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover,
actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, other methodological considerations, or
third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous
or be subject to misinterpretation. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our
strategies, and any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to act responsibly with respect
to, such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate
change, sustainability or ESG matters could result in adverse publicity or potential regulatory/investor engagement
or litigation and adversely affect our business and reputation. For example, there have been increasing allegations of
greenwashing against companies making significant ESG claims due to, among other things, allegations of
incomplete disclosures, as well as to variety of perceived deficiencies in performance, including as stakeholder
perceptions of sustainability continue to evolve. Additionally, many of our wholesale partners, consumers, business
parties, and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks,
including risks that may not be known to us.

**_Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial_**
**_condition._**

Given the broad and global scope of our operations, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of

climate change, such as shifts in weather patterns. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores,
suppliers, manufacturers, factories, wholesale partners, consumers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and
vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters
such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their
related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily
disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers, wholesale
partners and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that
may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe
weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, employees, wholesale partners,
consumers, distribution centers and vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety
and availability of the relevant personnel, raw materials, and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties’
computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe
weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an
adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our
merchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions
and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as
the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers, wholesale partners and consumers. In
particular, our brands and products that cater to winter sports may be impacted by climate change, including due to
seasonal shifts and rising temperatures. We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate, our operational
size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks (“IT
Systems”), including the Internet and third-party services position us well, but may not be sufficient for all or for
concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or
concurrent events, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or
regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our
operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers,


-----

replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our IT Systems or supply
systems, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our wholesale partners and consumers.
For more information regarding risks related to our IT Systems, see “—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property
and Information Technology—We rely on a large number of complex IT Systems. Any failure to operate, maintain
and upgrade our IT Systems may materially and adversely affect our operations.” These events could result in
reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, to the extent catastrophic events become more
frequent or intense, it may adversely impact the availability or cost of insurance.

**_Political uncertainty or geopolitical tensions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operation and financial condition._**

As a multinational company, geopolitical events could have an impact on our business. Changes, potential

changes or uncertainties in regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade,
manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we operate or sell our
products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

For example, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has significantly amplified existing geopolitical

tensions among Russia, Ukraine, Europe, the PRC and the United States. We cannot predict how the conflict in
Ukraine will evolve, but any escalation or expansion into other countries, particularly in Europe, would exacerbate
geopolitical tensions and could lead to political and/or economic response from the United States, the EU and other
countries, which may adversely impact economic conditions. While we suspended all significant commercial
activities in Russia by the end of 2022, and our revenue in Russia represented 1.8% and 0.5% of our revenue in 2021
and 2022, respectively, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect global energy
and financial markets and thus could adversely impact our operations. In addition, any escalation or expansion into
neighboring countries where we have significant operations could adversely impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global
community, and counteractive measures may be taken by the Russian government, other entities in Russia or
governments or other entities outside of Russia. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, an
increased risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or
others at its direction. Although, to date, our IT Systems have not been compromised by these incidents, it is
possible that future information security or cybersecurity incidents involving our wholesale partners, consumers,
manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could successfully compromise our IT Systems, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, actions by the United States and other governments, including the Russian government, may limit

or prevent our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce any patent, trademark or other intellectual property
rights in Russia. These actions could result in partial or complete loss of such intellectual property rights in Russia.
For example, in March 2022, the Russian government adopted a decree allowing Russian companies and individuals
to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or
compensation. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our patented inventions in
Russia or from selling or importing products made using our patented inventions in and into Russia. It is possible
that the Russian government will adopt similar measures with regard to other types of intellectual property,
including trademarks, or that Russian courts, even absent any additional decrees, will refuse to enforce existing
intellectual property rights. Moreover, any prolonged non-use of our trademarks in Russia could result in the
cancellation of such trademarks. Any counterfeit activity, grey imports, intellectual property infringement,
misappropriation, dilution or other violation or the sale of unauthorized versions of our products that emerge in
response to these actions could damage our reputation and our brands and otherwise adversely affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition. For more information regarding risks related to our intellectual property,
see “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology.”

The extent and duration of the military action, the response thereto, including resulting sanctions, and resulting

future market disruptions, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Additionally, any such disruptions,
resulting sanctions or other actions (including cyberattacks) may magnify the impact of other risks factors discussed
in this offering memorandum.


-----

**Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation**

**_Changes to trade policies, tariffs, import/export regulations and anti-competition regulations in the United_**
**_States, EU, PRC and other jurisdictions, or our failure to comply with such regulations, may have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our businesses must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and

regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Asset Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security
Council, and other relevant sanctions authorities. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may
eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to
prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change and other environmental legislation,
product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the United States, the EU and

around the world, violations of the regulations of which could also result in claims for civil penalties or
administrative remedies. The global nature operations expose us to the potential for inadvertent violations in cross
border transactions and could result in sanctions or fines if such violations were to occur.

Further, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in

the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our
business. Tariffs and other changes in United States and other trade policies have in the past and could in the future
trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering
imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either
in the United States, the PRC, the EU or any of its member states or in other countries could affect the trade
environment. Trade tensions have escalated in recent years between the United States and the PRC, with each
country imposing significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. It may be
time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such
changes. We, similar to many other multinational corporations, do a significant amount of business that would be
impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and other countries (including governmental action
related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to
adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we
conduct operations, the sports and outdoor industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could
have negative impact on our reputation business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

**_Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_reputation, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), as well as the anti
corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to
promote compliance with these laws, our directors, officers, employees, agents or other partners or representatives,
as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation
of our policies or such laws. We face significant risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or
other partners or representatives fail to comply with these laws and governmental authorities in the United States or
elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.

Any actual or alleged violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could result

in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse
media coverage, investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions. Responding to any investigation or action would
likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense
costs and other professional fees. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability
for FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any of these consequences
could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and
growth prospects.


-----

**_We may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings and audits._**

Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, labor and

employment, product safety, labelling, sales and other taxes, customs, and consumer protection laws and ordinances
that regulate the sports and outdoor industry generally or govern the production, importation, promotion and sale of
merchandise, and the operation of warehouse facilities. For example, various jurisdictions worldwide have laws and
regulations that aim to protect consumers, including by prohibiting advertising or marketing practices that may be
deemed misleading or deceptive. Failure to comply with any laws or regulations could subject us to lawsuits and
other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. From time to time, we may become
involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including, but not limited to, government and agency
investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In addition, we could become subject to
potential antitrust claims, which may relate to anti-competitive behavior, pricing pressures on our distribution
partners or other allegations, as well as regulatory actions related to anti-competition regulatory authorities in the
United States, the EU and in other countries where we operate. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings,
audits and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our
operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of money, harming our financial condition. Additionally,
defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and
diversion of management’s attention and resources, harming our financial condition. There can be no assurance that
any pending or future legal or regulatory proceedings and audits will not harm our business, financial condition,
reputation and results of operations.

**_If any of our brands’ products have manufacturing or design defects or are otherwise unacceptable to us or_**
**_our wholesale partners and/or consumers, our business could be harmed._**

We have occasionally received, and may in the future receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with

our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. We have also received, and may
in the future receive, products that are otherwise unacceptable to us or our wholesale partners and/or consumers.
Under these circumstances, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of
revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs.
Additionally, if the unacceptability of our products is not discovered until after such products are sold, our wholesale
partners and/or consumers could lose confidence in our brands’ products or we could face a product recall and our
results of operations could suffer and our business, reputation and brands could be harmed.

Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties. Any defects could make

our brands’ products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage or personal injury, in particular
with respect to our sporting goods and equipment products, and we may become subject to the hazards and
uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. The occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of
our brands’ products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations or
lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers or others who use our brands’ products are injured. Even if
injuries are not the result of any defects, if they are perceived to be, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any
claims and our brand and reputation may be harmed.

**_We face safety risks related to the manufacture of our sporting goods and equipment._**

The production of sporting good and equipment involves working with metal, glue and other potentially

dangerous inputs. In connection with our sporting goods and equipment brands, we face risks related to the
manufacturing of products, and in particular we face risks related to fire due to the flammable nature of glue used in
the production process. If there were to be a fire at any of our manufacturing plants, we would face risks related to
employee safety, destruction of property and delays in our ability to fulfill orders, all of which could adversely affect
our results of operations.

**_We could face risks arising out of compliance with, or liabilities under, environmental, health and safety laws_**
**_and regulations._**

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that, among other matters, (i)

regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the use of
regulated materials in the manufacture of our products or emissions or disposal of certain materials, substances or
wastes, (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, spills at our current and


-----

former facilities, waste disposal at third-party sites, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances,
and (iii) regulate workplace safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations could increase our and our thirdparty manufacturers’ costs and impact the availability of materials required to manufacture our products. Violation
of these laws and regulations may subject us to significant fines, penalties or disposal costs, which could negatively
impact our results of operations. We could be responsible for the investigation and remediation of environmental
conditions at currently or formerly owned, operated or leased sites, including at certain legacy sites in the United
States and France where we are engaged in remediation, as well as for associated liabilities, including liabilities for
natural resource damages, third-party property damage or personal injury. Such liabilities could result from lawsuits
that could be brought by the government or private litigants, relating to our operations, the operations of facilities or
the land on which our facilities are located. In addition, such remediation liabilities can arise in connection with
facility expansions, such as the expansion of our facility in Romania, where we are investigating and remediating
lead contamination in soil. In addition, liability for contamination under certain environmental laws and regulations
can be imposed on current or past owners or operators of a site without regard to fault. As such, we may be subject
to these liabilities regardless of whether we lease or own the facility, and regardless of whether such environmental
conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant, or by a third party or a neighboring facility whose
operations may have affected such facility or land. We cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to
our prior, existing or future or expanded sites or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have
assumed or acquired will not have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with_**
**_regulatory standards and requirements._**

We are exposed to the risk that our employees may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity.

Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of
unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the
reporting of true, complete, and accurate information to such authorities; or laws that require the reporting of
financial information or data accurately. We are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud,
misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices.

We have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter

misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may
not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental
investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Our
operations also involve third-party manufacturers, suppliers, wholesale partners and others, and if any of these thirdparty actors fail to comply with applicable laws, they may subject us to litigation or other reputational risks. See “—
Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers—The operations of our suppliers and third-party
manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control, including those that may result in
significant disruptions in supply, and that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none
occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting
our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal
and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits
and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our
business and our results of operations.

**_There remain some uncertainties as to whether we will be required to obtain approvals from PRC authorities to_**
**_list on the U.S. exchanges and offer securities in the future, and if required, we cannot assure you that we will_**
**_be able to obtain such approval._**

Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business

operations in certain areas, including increasing enforcement against illegal activities in the securities market,
enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structures, adopting
new measures to conduct cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti- monopoly enforcement. For
example, on December 28, 2021, the CAC and other PRC authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review
Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022. The Cybersecurity Review Measures provide that “a network
platform operator” that possesses personal information of more than one million users and seeks a listing in a
foreign country must apply for a cybersecurity review. Further, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may
initiate a cybersecurity review against any company if they determine certain network products, services, or data


-----

processing activities of such company affect or may affect national security. As a network platform operator who
possesses personal information of more than one million users for purposes of the Cybersecurity Review Measures,
we have applied for and completed a cybersecurity review with respect to the Amer Sports IPO pursuant to the
Cybersecurity Review Measures.

On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities

Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Administrative Measures”) and five supporting guidelines
(collectively, the “CSRC Filing Rules”), which came into effect on March 31, 2023. According to the CSRC Filing
Rules, an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the CSRC Filing Rules if the following
criteria are met at the same time: (a) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profits, total assets or net
assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year are
accounted for by PRC domestic companies, and (b) the main parts of the issuer’s business activities are conducted
in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge of
its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China. The CSRC
Filing Rules also stated that the determination of whether it is applicable to the issuer will be done in accordance
with the principle of “substance over form,” and that for issuers incorporated outside the PRC that do not meet
criteria (a) and/or (b) in the preceding sentence, if the offering document includes major risk factors relating to
mainland China, the lead underwriters and the issuer’s PRC counsel will be required to consider and analyze, in
accordance with the principle of “substance over form,” whether the CSRC Filing Rules should apply. Furthermore,
the CSRC Filing Rules provide a negative list of types of issuers banned from listing overseas, the issuers’
obligation to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection laws, and certain other matters
such as the requirements that an issuer (i) file with the CSRC within three business days after it submits an
application for initial public offering to the competent overseas regulator and (ii) file subsequent reports with the
CSRC on material events, including change of control and voluntary or forced delisting, after its overseas offering
and listing.

As advised by our PRC counsel, we were not required to obtain regulatory approval from the CSRC or go

through the filing procedures under the CSRC Filing Rules before our ordinary shares can be listed or offered in the
United States because (i) the main parts of our business activities are conducted outside mainland China, and our
main places of business are located outside mainland China, and (ii) our senior managers in charge of our business
operation and management are predominantly non-PRC citizens or not domiciled in mainland China. Nevertheless,
as the CSRC Filing Rules are newly issued, there remains uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted or
implemented. Therefore, we cannot assure you that whether we will be subject to such filing requirements for our
securities offering in the future, and if we do, we will be able to get clearance from the CSRC in a timely manner, or
at all.

Since these rules, statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or

administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed
implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. Changing regulatory requirements and
any failure of us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly limit or completely hinder our
ability to offer or continue to offer the ordinary shares, cause significant disruption to our business operations,
severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and
cause the ordinary shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless.

**Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology**

**_If we are unable to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for the products we_**
**_develop, or if the scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to_**
**_develop and commercialize products substantially similar to ours, and our business may be adversely affected._**

Our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business. We rely on a combination of intellectual property

laws, including patent, trademark, copyright, design and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures
and contractual provisions, to maintain, protect and enforce our rights in our brands, technologies, proprietary
information and processes. Failure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property
rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of our competitive
advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition
and results of operations.


-----

We rely on our trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products from those of our

competitors, to market our brands, and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, and we have registered
or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be
approved, and effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which
our products are marketed and sold. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name that incorporates one or more
of our trademarks or trade names may be available to be registered, or may be registered by us, even if available.
Our trademarks and trade names, whether or not registered, may be infringed, diluted, misappropriated, declared
generic, determined to be dilutive or otherwise violated.

The validity and enforceability of our trademarks may be challenged, and our trademark registrations could be

cancelled or may lapse. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand
our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote significant resources in
advertising and marketing new brands. Further, competitors may adopt trademarks or trade names similar to ours,
thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there
could be trade name or trademark infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation claims brought against us by
owners of other trademarks, including trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered
trademarks or trade names. We have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, trademark coexistence agreements to settle such claims. Such agreements may restrict the ways in which we are permitted to
obtain, maintain, protect, enforce and use the relevant trademarks. Without adequate protection for our trademarks
and trade names, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be
adversely affected.

Additionally, we rely on patent laws for the protection of our technologies and product designs. We plan to

apply for, and expect to continue to apply for, additional patent protection for proprietary aspects of existing and
new products and technologies. We cannot guarantee that our patent applications will be successful and result in
issued patents. Even if issued, the patents may not be of sufficient scope to provide us with competitive advantages
or may be of limited territorial reach. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship,
scope, validity or enforceability, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents. Such
proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as review,
reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights. If such challenges are
successful, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or
future products, and we may also face increased competition to our business, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Certain of our patents are due to expire in the near future, which may reduce or eliminate our competitive

advantage in the jurisdictions in which these patents are expiring. Additionally, obtaining and maintaining patents
can be time-consuming and expensive, and accordingly we do not seek patent protection in every jurisdiction in the
world, and may not obtain certain of our patents in all of our key markets. As a result, our patent portfolio may not
provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. It is
also possible that third parties, including our competitors, may obtain patents relating to products or technologies
that overlap or compete with our technology. If third parties obtain patent protection with respect to such products or
technologies, they may assert that our technology infringes their patents and seek to charge us a licensing fee or
otherwise preclude the use of certain of our designs or technologies.

We also rely on agreements under which we contract to own, or license the rights to use, intellectual property

developed by employees, contractors and other third parties, and to maintain the confidentiality of, and control
access to and the use and disclosure of, certain trade secrets and other proprietary information to preserve our
position in the market. We employ various methods to protect such intellectual property, such as entering into
intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality agreements and non-compete agreements, as applicable,
with certain employees, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators. However, we may fail to enter into such
agreements with all relevant parties or such agreements may not be self-executing, and we may be subject to claims
that such parties have misappropriated the trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information of
their former employers or other third parties. In addition, such agreements may be breached or rendered
unenforceable by changes in applicable law. Thus, our efforts may not be effective in controlling access to our
proprietary information, and we may not be able to prevent all unauthorized use and disclosure of our trade secrets
and other proprietary information, and under trade secret law, we have no protection against third parties who
independently develop the same or similar technology. Depending on the parties involved in a breach of any such
agreement, the available remedies may not provide adequate compensation for the value of the proprietary


-----

information disclosed to a third party. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we
could be materially adversely impacted in our ability to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in the market.
Furthermore, even if we successfully maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other proprietary
information, competitors may independently develop products or technologies that are substantially similar or
superior to our own.

Intellectual property rights in certain elements of our products and manufacturing technology are owned or

controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. As a result, our current and future competitors may be
able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, designs and styling similar to our products.
If our competitors sell products similar to ours at lower prices, our financial results could suffer. In addition, if any
third party copies or imitates our products in a manner that affects our wholesale partners’ or consumer perception
of the quality of our products, our reputation and sales could suffer whether or not they violate our intellectual
property rights.

We also may be forced to bring claims against third parties to determine the ownership of what we regard as our

intellectual property or to enforce our intellectual property against its infringement, misappropriation, dilution or
other violations by third parties. However, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from
unauthorized use by others may not be effective and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights
will be sufficient to protect against others offering products that are substantially similar or superior to ours and that
compete with our business. If we bring a claim to enforce our intellectual property, the defendant could claim that
our asserted intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable and, if that defense is successful, we could lose
valuable intellectual property rights. The outcomes of such intellectual property-related proceedings are often
unpredictable. In addition, even if we are successful in enforcing our intellectual property against third parties, the
damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Regardless of whether any such
proceedings are resolved in our favor, such proceedings could cause us to incur significant expenses and could
distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, if the strength of our intellectual property
portfolio is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade others from collaborating with us to license
intellectual property, or develop or commercialize current or future products. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our
intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from
the intellectual property that we develop or license.

Effective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and

ongoing prosecution and maintenance requirements and the costs of defending our rights. Furthermore, monitoring
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our
competitors’ products, and may in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement,
misappropriation, dilution or other violation. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights
may not be adequate to prevent the infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of our intellectual
property. We may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual
property rights, or pursue all counterfeiters who may seek to benefit from our brand. Any inability to meaningfully
protect our intellectual property rights could result in harm to our ability to compete and reduce demand for our
products. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our
market positions and business opportunities.

The global footprint of our product offerings exposes us to additional intellectual property challenges. Patent,

trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws vary significantly throughout the world. The legal
systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not protect intellectual property rights to
the same extent as they are protected in the United States. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in
foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our
business, could put our intellectual property rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our
intellectual property applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. It
may therefore be difficult for us to successfully challenge the infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other
violation of our intellectual property by other parties in these other countries, which could diminish the value of our
brand and cause our competitive position and growth to suffer.

**_Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise_**
**_violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may currently hold, or obtain in the future,

patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights that could prevent or limit our ability to make, use, develop,
sell or market certain of our products, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. As we face
increasing competition, the possibility of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, dilution or
other violation made by third parties against us grows. While we try to avoid infringing the rights of others, we may
unknowingly do so. For example, we may not be aware of existing patents or patent applications that could be
pertinent to our business. Any claim or litigation alleging that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated intellectual property rights of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not settled out of court or
determined in our favor, could be time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could divert the time and
attention of our management and technical personnel. While some claims may be made by third parties seeking to
obtain a competitive advantage, other claims may be brought for the sole purpose of revenue generation, including
by non-practicing entities or individuals with no relevant product sales. It may be more difficult to defend against
such claims, as we cannot deter such claims by threatening to assert our own intellectual property portfolio in
response. Additionally, some third parties have substantially greater human and financial resources than we do and
are able to sustain the costs and workload of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for
longer periods of time than we could. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no
assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, third parties may seek, and we
may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential
preliminary injunctions requiring us to change our products or even cease the commercialization of our products
entirely.

We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. The terms of such a

settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other
party. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable
judgment, including being subject to an injunction and being required to pay substantial monetary damages,
including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual
property rights. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be
unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations. Further, our liability insurance may not cover potential
claims of this type adequately or at all. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be
in violation of a third party’s rights. If we are required or choose to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements,
such arrangements may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating
costs and expenses. Such arrangements may also only be available on a non-exclusive basis, such that third parties,
including our competitors, could have access to use the same intellectual property to compete with us. We may also
have to redesign our products so they do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party intellectual
property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which
our products may not be available for commercialization or use. If we cannot redesign our products in a noninfringing manner or obtain a license for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit
our products and may be unable to compete effectively.

In addition, in any intellectual property proceeding against us or that we assert against a third party, there could

be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if
securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the
price of our ordinary shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our expenses and reduce the
resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Furthermore,
because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a
risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.
Any of the foregoing, and any unfavorable resolution of such disputes and litigation, could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We license certain of our intellectual property rights to others. If we fail to adequately monitor our licensees’_**
**_compliance with our license agreements, our intellectual property rights may be subject to cancellation, loss of_**
**_rights, or diminution in value, and we may be subject to third-party claims of intellectual property_**


-----

**_infringement, misappropriation, dilution and other violation with respect to products designed and_**
**_manufactured by our licensees._**

We license certain of our intellectual property rights to others, including on an exclusive basis or pursuant to

certain franchise arrangements. Such agreements provide our licensees with rights to our intellectual property and
contain provisions requiring our licensees to comply with certain standards to be monitored by us. Our failure to
adequately monitor our licensees’ compliance with these standards, or to take appropriate corrective action when
necessary, may subject our intellectual property to cancellation, loss of rights, or diminution in value. In addition,
the licensing of any of our intellectual property could result in a potential misuse of such intellectual property. There
can be no assurance that third parties will comply with their contractual requirements or that they will use our
licensed intellectual property in an appropriate manner. Any misuse by a third party of intellectual property related
to our trademarks or brands could lead to a negative perception of our brands by current and potential licensees,
joint venture partners or consumers, and could adversely affect our ability to develop our brands and meet our
strategic goals, which, in turn, could decrease our potential revenue.

As a licensor of intellectual property, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits related to products designed

or manufactured by our licensees. In most cases, our licensees are obligated to defend and indemnify us and our
affiliates with respect to such litigation, but such indemnifying parties may be unable or unwilling to uphold their
contractual obligations. We also may be required to indemnify certain of our licensees or wholesale partners for
claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation brought against them.
While we maintain insurance for certain risks, it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all possible
liabilities, and we have no assurances that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage of a claim. Any litigation has an element of uncertainty
and if any such litigation were to be adversely determined, if a licensee were to fail to properly indemnify us, if we
must indemnify a licensee or wholesale partner, and/or if we did not have appropriate insurance coverage or if our
insurer denied coverage, such litigation could affect our financial position and liquidity. Further, any adverse
determination could damage our reputation or otherwise adversely impact the value of or goodwill associated with
our relevant brands.

**_We license intellectual property rights from third parties, including our brand ambassadors and league_**
**_partners. If we fail to comply with our obligations in any current or future agreements under which we license_**
**_intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships_**
**_with our licensors, we could lose licensed rights that are important to our business._**

We are, and may become, party to license agreements, including endorsement agreements, with third parties to

obtain the rights to certain intellectual property, technologies and products, or to allow commercialization or
promotion of our own products. Such agreements may impose numerous obligations, such as development,
payment, royalty, sublicensing, insurance, enforcement and other obligations on us in order to maintain the licenses.
In spite of our best efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached such license agreements
and might therefore terminate such license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to use certain brands
or develop and commercialize products covered by such license agreements. For example, we license certain
intellectual property rights from the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National
Collegiate Athletics Association, other sports leagues and organizations, universities, athletes and influencers,
among others, for use in connection with our products. If our license agreements or endorsement agreements with
any one of these organizations, athletes or influencers were to terminate for any reason, we would be required to
cease the development, advertisement, promotion and sale of certain of our products bearing such licensed
intellectual property or modify the affected products or marketing materials to remove such licensed intellectual
property. The foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability or financial condition.

Disputes also may arise between us and our licensors regarding the intellectual property licensed to us under

any license agreement, including disputes related to:

  - the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;

  - our compliance with reporting, financial or other obligations under the license agreement;

  - the amounts of royalties or other payments due under the license agreement;


-----

  - whether and the extent to which we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property rights
of the licensor that are not subject to the license agreement;

  - our right to sublicense applicable rights to third parties;

  - our right to transfer or assign the license; and

  - the ownership of intellectual property and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual
property by our licensors and us and our partners.

If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose any or all of our rights under such license agreements,

experience significant delays in the development and commercialization of our products and technologies or incur
liability for damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our business may suffer if our licensors fail to abide by the terms of our license agreements, if our licensors fail

to enforce licensed intellectual property against infringing third parties, if the intellectual property rights licensed to
us are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are generally unable to enter into necessary licenses on
acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors, and, in
connection with obtaining such licenses, we may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more
favorable to the applicable licensor, including by agreeing to terms that could enable third parties, including our
competitors, to receive licenses to a portion of the intellectual property that is subject to our existing licenses and to
compete with our products. Our licensors may be free to exploit any rights that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive
basis for themselves or to license such intellectual property to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that
may be superior to those offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, the
agreements under which we may license intellectual property from third parties are likely to be complex, and certain
provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract
interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant
intellectual property, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant
agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, financial condition or results
of operations.

**_A security breach or other disruption to our IT Systems could result in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized_**
**_disclosure, or unauthorized access of wholesale partner, consumer, supplier, or sensitive company information_**
**_or could disrupt our operations, which could damage our relationships with wholesale partners, consumers,_**
**_suppliers or employees, expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings, or harm our reputation, any of which_**
**_could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

Our business involves the storage and transmission of a significant amount of personal, confidential, and

sensitive information, including the personal information of our consumers and employees, information relating to
consumer preferences, and our proprietary financial, operational and strategic information. The protection of this
information is vitally important to us as the loss, theft, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of, access to or other
processing of such information could lead to significant reputational or competitive harm, result in litigation
involving us or our business partners, expose us to regulatory proceedings, and cause us to incur substantial
liabilities, fines, penalties, or expenses. As a result, we believe our future success and growth depends, in part, on
the ability of our key business processes and systems, including our IT and global communication systems, to
prevent the theft, loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of, access to or other processing of this personal,
confidential, and sensitive information, and to respond quickly and effectively if any such security incidents do
occur.

The frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyberattacks, ransomware attacks, and other security incidents,

including personal information breaches, has significantly increased in recent years and it is expected that these
trends will continue. As with many other businesses, we have experienced, and are continually at risk of being
subject to, such attacks and incidents. Due to the increased risk of these types of attacks and incidents, we expend
significant resources on IT Systems and security tools, measures, and processes designed to protect our IT Systems,
as well as the personal, confidential, or sensitive information stored on or transmitted through those systems, and to
ensure an effective response to any cyberattack or security incident. Despite the implementation of preventative and
detective security controls, our IT Systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources,


-----

including telecommunications or network failures or interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, epidemics,
malicious human acts, terrorism and war. Our IT Systems are also vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins,
security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party service providers,
contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, from cyberattacks by malicious third parties
(including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, password
spraying, credential stuffing, phishing, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information), or other security incidents. These risks may be exacerbated in the remote
work environment. Additionally, due to the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict, there have been publicized threats to
increase hacking activity against the critical infrastructure of any nation or organization that is supportive of
Ukraine. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to IT Systems are constantly evolving and
becoming more sophisticated (including by threat actors’ increasing use of artificial intelligence), may not be
recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as
external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments or
agencies, or state-sponsored actors, we may be unable to anticipate all types of security threats or implement
adequate preventive measures in response. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship
products to wholesale partners and consumers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of our IT
Systems. We also use these systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting
purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. As such, any of the
foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

Cyberattacks or security incidents could remain undetected for an extended period, which could potentially

result in significant harm to our IT Systems, as well as unauthorized access to the information stored on and
transmitted by our IT Systems. Even when a security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be
determined immediately. The costs to us to mitigate cyberattacks and security incidents could be significant and,
while we have implemented security measures to protect our IT Systems, our efforts to address these problems may
not be successful. Further, despite our security efforts and training, our employees may purposefully or inadvertently
cause security breaches that could harm our IT Systems or result in the unauthorized disclosure of or access to
information. Any measures we do take to prevent security breaches, whether caused by employees or third parties,
have the potential to limit our ability to complete sales or ship products to our wholesale partners and consumers,
harm relationships with our suppliers, or restrict our ability to meet our consumers’ expectations with respect to their
online or retail shopping experience. A cyberattack or other security incident could result in the significant and
protracted disruption of our business such that:

  - critical business systems become inoperable or require a significant amount of time or cost to restore;

  - key personnel are unable to perform their duties or communicate with employees, consumers or third-party
partners;

  - it results in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access of wholesale partner,
consumer, supplier or company information;

  - we are prevented from accessing information necessary to conduct our business;

  - we are required to make unanticipated investments in equipment, technology or security measures;

  - consumers cannot access our e-commerce websites and consumer orders may not be received or fulfilled;

  - we become subject to return fraud schemes, reselling schemes and imposter websites schemes; or

  - we become subject to other unanticipated liabilities, costs or claims.

If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and

results of operations and result in harm to our reputation.

Furthermore, although we currently maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans to address such

disruptions, we may not be able to adequately continue our business or return to operability within a reasonable
period of time in the case of such an occurrence. Recovery of our IT Systems may be additionally hampered where
we have outsourced the operation of IT Systems and information storage to third parties.


-----

A security breach that results in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information could also expose us to

liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental
or regulatory investigation. Due to concerns about information security and integrity, a growing number of
legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that
information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding security
of such information are possible. We are subject to an increasing number of reporting obligations, including, in
some jurisdictions, an obligation to disclose our processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks
from cybersecurity threats, and we have had to, and may in the future need to, notify governmental authorities,
affected individuals and other third parties with respect to cybersecurity incidents. For example, laws in the
European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK and all 50 U.S. states may require businesses to provide notice to
individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of an information security breach. Some laws
impose specific data breach reporting obligations if special categories of personal information that we process, such
as health data, is disclosed as a result of an information security breach. Complying with such numerous and
complex regulations in the event of an information security breach would be expensive and difficult, and failure to
comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny, sanctions and additional liability. We may
also be contractually required to notify business partners of a security incident. Regardless of our contractual
protections, any actual or perceived security incident, or breach of our legal or contractual obligations, could harm
our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability or require us to expend significant resources on information
security and in responding to any such actual or perceived incident.

In addition, if a cyberattack or other security incident results in the loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized

disclosure of, access to or other processing of personal, confidential, or sensitive information belonging to our
wholesale partners, consumers, suppliers, or employees, it could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the
deterioration of our wholesale partners’ and consumers’ confidence in our brand, cause our suppliers to reconsider
their relationship with our company or impose more onerous contractual provisions on us and subject us to potential
litigation (including class action), liability, fines and penalties. For more information regarding risks related to data
privacy and security, see “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology—We are
subject to various laws, rules, regulations and guidelines relating to data privacy and security governing the use and
processing of personal information. Changes in such laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, or any actual or
perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines or contractual or other obligations
relating to data privacy and security, could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include
administrative fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension of processing activities and audits), private litigation or
adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.”

We are also reliant on the security practices of our third-party service providers, which may be outside of our

direct control. These third parties, and the services provided by these third parties, which may include cloud-based
services, are subject to the same risk of experiencing, and have experienced, outages, other failures and security
breaches described above. IT Systems provided by third parties on which we rely also may be difficult to integrate
with other tools due to their complexity, resulting in high data inconsistency and incompatibility. If these third
parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices, or experience a breach of their systems, the information of our
employees, wholesale partners, consumers and business associates may be improperly accessed, used, disclosed or
otherwise processed, and we may potentially be held liable, or alleged to be liable, under certain laws or contractual
obligations for the acts or omissions of our third-party providers. In addition, our providers may have broad
discretion to change and interpret the terms of service and other policies with respect to us, and those actions may be
unfavorable to our business operations. Our providers also may take actions beyond our control that could harm our
business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms,
terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process
information in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. Although we expect that we could obtain similar services
from other third parties, if our arrangements with our current providers were terminated, we could experience
interruptions in our business, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for alternative services. Any
loss or interruption to our IT Systems or the services provided by third parties could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We do not currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, and therefore the successful assertion of one or more

large claims against us in connection with a breach or other cybersecurity-related matter could adversely affect our
business and financial condition.


-----

**_We rely on a large number of complex IT Systems. Any failure to operate, maintain and upgrade our IT_**
**_Systems may materially and adversely affect our operations._**

It is critical to our success that wholesale partners and consumers and potential new consumers within the

countries we operate in are able to access our online services at all times. We operate on a combination of shared
and individual, central or local IT Systems, including cloud-based infrastructure, and related solutions. Any failure
of either central or local IT Systems and functions may disrupt the efficiency and functioning of all our operations.
Updates or changes in the software or hardware technology may lead to failures of communication between our
platforms and consumers in the course of the order transmission or other processes. We therefore rely on a large
number of IT Systems, as well as local network and internet coverage, to manage the entire process, from the
placing of and payment for orders online by consumers to the receipt of and confirmation of those orders by our
backend systems, which creates significant complexity and negatively affects our ability to scale our business and
realize cost savings.

We have made substantial investments into the development of our IT Systems, which form the backbone of our

business operations. Due to the complexity of these IT Systems, we cannot rule out that they may cause or
contribute to failures in the order transmission process or may prove less efficient than anticipated. In addition, a
failure of any individual network carrier, IT System or IT provider would impact our ability to accurately predict the
level of demand for our products, receive and transmit orders or to accept payment for orders. The efficient
operation and scalability of our own IT Systems and the third-party IT Systems on which we rely is therefore critical
to maintain operations and decision-making processes. We are currently in the process of upgrading our global SAP
enterprise resource planning system across all our brands and may face risks related thereto, including an increased
risk of cyberattacks or other security breaches. Furthermore, the continued operation and development of our IT
Systems depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees. The loss of the services of such key
individuals could harm our ability to maintain our IT Systems, which could materially and adversely affect our
operations.

It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during

peak usage times and as consumer traffic increases. If our online marketplace is unavailable when users attempt to
access it or does not load as quickly as consumers expect, they may seek other services, and may not return to our
online marketplace as often in the future, or at all. This would harm our ability to attract consumers and decrease the
frequency with which consumers use our online marketplace. We expect to continue to make significant investments
to maintain and improve the availability of our online marketplace and to enable rapid releases of new products. To
the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, respond adequately to service disruptions, upgrade
our systems as needed or continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and
anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations would be harmed. We have previously
experienced service disruptions, and in the future, we may experience further service disruptions, outages, or other
performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and
capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously. In some
instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable
period of time. For more information regarding risks related to our IT Systems, see “—Risks Related to Our
Intellectual Property and Information Technology—A security breach or other disruption to our IT Systems could
result in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of wholesale partner, consumer,
supplier, or sensitive company information or could disrupt our operations, which could damage our relationships
with wholesale partners, consumers, suppliers or employees, expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings, or
harm our reputation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.”

**_We are subject to various laws, rules, regulations and guidelines relating to data privacy and security_**

We are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws, directives, industry standards, rules and

regulations, as well as contractual obligations, related to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we


-----

operate. We collect, maintain, use and otherwise process information, including personal information, available to us
through online activities and other consumer interactions in our business as well as from individuals in other
circumstances, such as employee and business contacts, and certain of our marketing practices rely upon e-mail,
cookies, tracking technologies and other e-marketing technologies to communicate with consumers. Our current and
future marketing programs may depend on our ability to collect, maintain, use and otherwise process this
information, and our ability to do so is subject to evolving U.S. and other international laws and enforcement trends,
including in the EEA and UK where European court and regulatory decisions are driving increased attention to
cookies and tracking technologies.

The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and

constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable
future. These laws, rules and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If applicable data privacy and marketing laws
become more restrictive at the international, federal or state levels, our compliance and other costs may increase, our
ability to effectively engage consumers through personalized marketing may decrease and the effectiveness of our
marketing may be limited, our investment in our e-commerce platform may not be fully realized or our systems may
require significant changes, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance burden, our margins
may be adversely affected and our potential reputational harm or liability for security breaches or compliance
violations may increase. Moreover, in light of the complex and evolving nature of privacy laws, including relating to
certain categories of data (e.g., biometric and health data) and cookies and tracking technologies (including those in
the EEA and the UK), there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to comply with such laws
and associated regulatory expectations. Violations of such laws and associated regulatory expectations could result
in regulatory investigations, fines, orders to cease or change our use of such technologies, as well as civil claims
including class actions, and reputational damage.

In the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal

Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, rules and regulations concerning personal
information and information security and have prioritized privacy and information security violations for
enforcement actions. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights,
with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from
each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as
amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA,” and collectively, “CCPA”), and several other state laws,
which introduce new data protection and privacy rights, require covered companies to provide new disclosures, and
in some cases introduce a private right of action for certain data breaches. State laws are changing rapidly and there
is discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data protection law to which we would become subject if
it is enacted, which may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risks,
require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of
previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies.

We are also subject to international laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, which apply

broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information.
For example, in the EEA, we are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”),
and, following the UK’s exit from the EU, we are subject in the UK to the UK General Data Protection Regulation
and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), which currently imposes the same obligations as the EU
GDPR in most material respects. However, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate future changes to be
made to the EU GDPR (such changes would need to be specifically incorporated by the UK government), which
creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. The EU GDPR and UK GDPR also impose strict
rules on the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA and the UK. As the enforcement
landscape develops, and supervisory authorities issue further guidance on international data transfers, we could
suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, we may have to make certain
operational changes, we have had to and will have to implement revised transfer mechanisms for intragroup,
customer and vendor arrangements within required time frames, the manner in which we provide our products could
be affected, and it could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.

We are subject to evolving data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations in the PRC, particularly the

Cybersecurity Law (“CSL”), the Data Security Law (“DSL”), and the Personal Information Protection Law
(“PIPL”), along with their implementing regulations and standards. These laws require that any collection, use,


-----

transfer, and storage of personal information follow the three principles of legitimacy, justification, and necessity.
Consent from the data subject is required, unless there are other legal bases for processing. Furthermore, operators
of critical information infrastructure (“CIIOs”) and personal information handlers must locally store personal
information and important data generated within the PRC, if it exceeds a certain threshold defined by relevant
authorities. The CSL, DSL, and PIPL also specify rules for transferring personal information and important data
outside the PRC. Compliance with security assessments or certifications by designated agencies or entering into
approved standard contracts with overseas recipients are among the requirements for such transfers.

In addition to the CSL, the DSL and the PIPL, the relevant government authorities of the PRC promulgated

several regulations or released a number of draft regulations for public comments which are designed to provide
further implemental guidance in accordance with the laws mentioned above. We cannot predict what impact the new
laws and regulations or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the PRC, in
particular the CSL, DSL or PIPL, or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the
PRC due to their recent enactment and the limited guidance available, particularly on PIPL, which entities are
awaiting further guidance on, particularly on the scope of data localization requirement. It is also generally unclear
how the laws will be interpreted and enforced in practice by the relevant government authorities as often, the
abovementioned laws are drafted broadly and thus leave great discretion to the relevant government authorities to
exercise.

We post our privacy policy and practices concerning our collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer

and other processing of personal information on our websites and provide similar policies to our employees.
Although we endeavor to comply with legal obligations and our public statements and documentation, we may at
times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements
that provide promises and assurances about privacy and information security can subject us to potential government
or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices.

In addition, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). PCI DSS is a

specific set of comprehensive security standards imposed by payment card networks on companies that process
credit card information, related to enhancing payment account information security, including, but not limited to,
requirements for security management, policies, procedures and standards related to network architecture, software
design and certification requirements. PCI DSS compliance is required in order to maintain credit card processing
services and to provide our payment facilitation services. Additionally, we are also required to comply with payment
card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. Payment card networks
could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from
providing certain services to some consumers, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. Moreover, compliance
with PCI DSS does not guarantee a completely secure environment and, notwithstanding the results of a compliance
assessment, there can be no assurance that payment card networks will not request further compliance assessments
or set forth additional requirements binding on us to maintain access to credit card processing services. Compliance
is an ongoing effort and the requirements evolve as new threats are identified. In the event that we were to lose PCI
DSS compliance status (or fail to renew compliance under a future version of the PCI DSS), or if our information
security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ and our third-party
payments processors’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and
debit card payments from our consumers, process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online
payments, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs on us, such as costs

related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging
consultants, which are likely to increase over time. Such requirements may require us to modify our data processing
practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any failure or
perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws, rules, regulations and
guidelines relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with
our wholesale partners and consumers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies, wholesale
partners or consumers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which could subject us to
significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties, corrective measures or judgments, any of which could result in costly
investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties (including against officers), operational changes, and
negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our results of operations and financial
condition.

**Risks Related to Financial, Accounting and Tax Matters**

**_We plan to primarily use cash from operations to finance our growth strategy, but may need to raise additional_**
**_capital that may be required to grow our business, which we may not be able to raise on terms acceptable to us_**
**_or at all._**

While we intend to primarily finance our growth through the cash flows generated by our operations, we may

need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. Our ability to
obtain additional capital, if and when required, will depend on our business plans, investor demand, our operating
performance, market conditions, our credit rating and other factors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. Failure to secure any necessary financing, including any
refinancing of existing indebtedness, in a timely manner in our preferred currency, or on favorable terms could have
a material adverse effect on our growth strategy.

**_Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could harm our results of operations._**

We report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars but have significant non-U.S. operations. Our

functional currency is the euro. A large portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars, in
particular the euro, the Canadian dollar and Renminbi (“RMB”), and generally the applicable local currency is our
functional currency in that locality. Our sales are generally made in local currencies, while the majority of our costs
are paid in U.S. dollars or the euro. As a result, we face foreign currency exposure on the translation of net income,
assets and liabilities of our operations in numerous jurisdictions into U.S. dollars, including on our outstanding
indebtedness denominated in euro. Given the strength of the U.S. dollar against our key foreign currencies,
including the euro, the Canadian dollar and RMB, translation into U.S. dollars for the periods presented results in
lower profitability. In the future, if the U.S. dollar continues to be strong against local currencies, we will continue
to see lower profitability; however, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken against the euro or RMB, translation into U.S.
dollars could result in increased profitability.

Where possible, we manage foreign currency exposure through a variety of methods, including by financing

each business unit in its functional currency and concentrating cash flows through centralized entities to limit the
number of foreign currencies being utilized for purchases. Additionally, we enter into hedging arrangements to limit
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for a significant portion of our cash flows, in particular with our most
commonly used foreign currencies, including euros, Canadian dollars and RMB. The majority of our hedging
arrangements are short-term and are usually rolled forward within the standard business cycle. Nonetheless, it is not
practical for us to mitigate all of our foreign currency exposure, nor are we able to accurately predict the possible
impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, due to our constantly
changing exposure to various foreign currencies, difficulty in predicting fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the significant number of foreign currencies involved. As we continue to expand
our global operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant and could have a
significant and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.

Foreign exchange variations have been significant in the past and current foreign exchange rates may not be

indicative of future exchange rates, and may be further impacted by the efforts of central banks to curb inflation, in
the United States as well as in the other jurisdictions in which we operate and recognize sales and incur costs.
Significant variations in foreign exchange rates may also make hedging contracts ineffective for hedge accounting
purposes in future periods.

**_Our revenue and other operating income fluctuate on a seasonal basis._**

We experience limited seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and other operating income, with a slightly higher

portion of our revenue and earnings in the fourth fiscal quarter due to our higher share of fall and winter collections.
Any decrease in revenue or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows. Seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since
we usually manufacture and produce products, including for our wholesale partners in advance of our and their peak
selling periods. We manufacture a significant amount of inventory before the winter seasons. As such, working
capital requirements typically increase throughout our second and third fiscal quarters as inventory builds to support
our peak shipping and selling period which typically occurs from August to December. If we are not successful in


-----

selling inventory, they may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the
inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating_**
**_results could be adversely affected._**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS accounting principles requires management to

make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. We base our estimates on a set of underlying data that may include our historical experience,
knowledge of current events and conditions and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances at the time of the estimate, as provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” The results of these estimates
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of
revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in
preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue, inventory, impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and share-based payments. Our operating results may be adversely
affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could
cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.

**_We could incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, which could harm our profitability._**

We have goodwill and other intangible assets held on our balance sheet. We periodically review the carrying

values of goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether such carrying values exceed their recoverable
amount, which is the higher of the asset or cash generating unit’s (“CGU”) fair value less costs of disposal and value
in use. Declines in the profitability of individual reporting units due to economic or market conditions or otherwise,
as well as adverse changes in financial, competitive and other conditions, including declines in the operating
performance of our reportable segments or other adverse changes in the key valuation assumptions contributing to
the estimated fair value of our reportable segments, could adversely affect the estimated fair values of the related
reportable segments, which could result in an impairment of the recorded balances of goodwill or other intangible
assets.

**_We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to_**
**_remediate the material weakness or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail_**
**_to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or_**
**_timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business._**

In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we identified a material weakness

in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Specifically, the material weakness related to (i) lack of consistent and proper application of accounting

processes and procedures, defined control processes, including defined review and supervision roles in those control
processes, and segregation of duties and (ii) insufficient resources with an appropriate level of technical accounting
and SEC reporting expertise. We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal
control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness, including implementing new information
technology and systems for the preparation of financial statements, implementing additional review procedures
within our accounting and finance department, and hiring additional staff and engaging external accounting experts
to support improving our accounting processes and procedures and supplement our internal resources in our
computation processes. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in
the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or
that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses.

In addition, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an

evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) because no such evaluation has been required. As a public company, we
will be required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require us to
furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting


-----

commencing with our second annual report on Form 20-F. Moreover, beginning with our second annual report on
Form 20-F, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. Had we or our independent registered public accounting
firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional material weaknesses may have been identified. If we identify any additional material
weaknesses, or we are unable to successfully remediate our existing material weakness or any future material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we cannot comply with the requirements of the
Sarbanes- Oxley Act in a timely manner or attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if
our independent registered public accounting firm cannot express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting when required, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may
be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely
filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose
confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting and our share price may decline as a result,
and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or
other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.

**_Adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to the examination of our tax returns by tax authorities in Finland, Germany, the United States,

the PRC and the numerous other jurisdictions in which we have operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of an
adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes
could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, we and our
subsidiaries, as part of our ongoing operations, regularly engage in intercompany transactions and arrangements
based on transfer pricing policies that we have implemented. Although we believe that our transfer pricing policies
comply with applicable law, tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past challenged and
could in the future challenge our transfer pricing policies with respect to these transactions and arrangements. The
results of audits, challenges or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our cash tax liabilities, effective tax
rate, and financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.

**_We could be subject to changes in tax laws, tax regulations and tax treaties, including their interpretation and_**
**_application, in the Cayman Islands, Finland, Germany, the United States, the PRC, or any other country in_**
**_which we operate, which could result in additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate._**

We are subject to the tax laws in the Cayman Islands, Finland, Germany, the United States, the PRC and

numerous other jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws, tax regulations and tax
treaties, including their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. We earn a
substantial portion of our income in countries around the world and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions.
A number of the jurisdictions in which we operate have recently reformed or changed their tax laws, regulations and
tax treaties, such as the anti-tax avoidance directive adopted by the member states of the EU and the Inflation
Reduction Act adopted by the United States which, among other changes, introduced a 15% corporate minimum tax
on certain corporations, and many jurisdictions are considering other proposals to reform or change their tax laws,
regulations and tax treaties, including minimum tax and tax-avoidance proposals being considered in connection
with the OECD’s project on base erosion and profit shifting, and proposals in the United States. The adoption or
implementation of these proposals could significantly impact how we are taxed on our earnings from operations in
these jurisdictions. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will be adopted, several of
the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash
flows. Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and
rulings. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These
tax holidays, rulings and agreements expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain
conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The expiration or termination of any tax holidays,
rulings or agreements, or changes in the conditions governing such tax holidays, rulings or agreements, could have
an adverse effect on our effective income tax rate.


-----

**_We could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the_**
**_costs our consumers would have to pay for our products and adversely affect our operating results._**

In general, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions

in which we do not have a tax nexus, in reliance on court decisions or applicable exemptions that restrict or preclude
the imposition of obligations to collect such taxes with respect to online sales of our products. In addition, we have
not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do have a
physical presence, in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in
South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales
and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of
states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote
vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from
state to state. While we now collect, remit and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax, it is still possible
that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for previous periods for which we did not collect
sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could result in substantial
tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and operating results.

**Risks Related to Our Relationship with ANTA Sports**

**_ANTA Sports may fail to perform under the business services agreement (“BSA”), or we may fail to have_**
**_replacement systems and services in place when the BSA expires._**

We expect that following the completion of the Amer Sports IPO, ANTA Sports will continue to provide us

with services related to certain shared functions in Greater China pursuant to a BSA we entered into in connection
with the consummation of the Amer Sports IPO. See “Related Party Transactions—Transactions with ANTA
Sports.” These services will be provided for terms of varying duration following the completion of the Amer Sports
IPO. We will rely on ANTA Sports to satisfy its obligations during the term of the BSA.

Failure by ANTA Sports to perform these obligations, or any delay in or disruption to ANTA Sports’ ability to

perform these obligations, could increase our costs of procuring these services, result in system or service
interruptions, divert our management’s focus or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition, potentially for an extended period of time. Furthermore, pursuant to the BSA, ANTA Sports will
agree to perform the services for us in a manner consistent with the past practice of our business. As a result, our
operational flexibility to implement changes with respect to these services or the amounts we pay for them will be
limited, and we may not be able to implement changes in a manner desirable to us. In addition, we have historically
received informal support from ANTA Sports, which may not be addressed in the BSA. The level of this informal
support may diminish following the completion of the Amer Sports IPO.

The services that ANTA Sports will provide to us pursuant to the BSA are subject to change over time. Upon

the termination of the BSA in accordance with the terms thereof, or to the degree it is not renewed according to its
terms, we will be required to create our own, or engage alternative third-party sources to provide, systems and
services to replicate or replace many of the systems and services that ANTA Sports currently provides to us.
However, we may not be able to successfully replicate or replace these services or obtain the services at the same or
better quality, at the same or lower costs or otherwise on the same or more favorable terms and conditions from third
parties. If we do not have our own systems and services, or comparable agreements with alternative third-party
sources, in place when the BSA expires, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely
affected, including in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. For more information regarding risks related
to cybersecurity, see “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology.”

**_We potentially could have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms in our_**
**_agreements with ANTA Sports._**

The agreements we have entered into in connection with the Amer Sports IPO, with ANTA Sports, including

the BSA and the procurement and sourcing of products, sharing of certain middle to back- office services, retail
platform related transactions and licensing, have been negotiated by us during periods in which we did not have a
board of directors or a management team independent of ANTA Sports. See “Related Party Transactions—


-----

Transactions with ANTA.” Arm’s-length negotiations for similar products and services with an unaffiliated third
party may have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party.

**_The interests of ANTA Sports may conflict with us, our customers or the holder of the notes in the future._**

Following the consummation of the Amer Sports IPO, ANTA Sports continues to indirectly own a significant

amount of our outstanding voting equity. As a result, ANTA Sports continues to be able to strongly influence our
decisions to enter into any corporate transaction, regardless of whether the holders of notes believe that any such
transactions are in their own best interests. For example, ANTA Sports could exercise influence over us to make
acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which
may impair our ability to make payments under the notes. In addition, to the extent permitted by the indenture
governing the notes and the Credit Agreement, ANTA Sports may exercise influence over us to pay dividends rather
than make capital expenditures or otherwise use our funds for the benefit of our business. Potential conflicts of
interest could also arise if we enter into commercial arrangements with ANTA Sports in the future. ANTA Sports
may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business or entering into additional lines of business
which may conflict with these arrangements. Also, ANTA Sports may pursue acquisitions that may be
complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
Furthermore, certain of our current or potential future customers may believe the interests of ANTA Sports conflict
with theirs which may impact our ability to attract and retain certain customers.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Shared Collateral, the_**
**_representative of the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive_**
**_right to control actions (including the exercise of remedies) with respect to the Shared Collateral. The First_**
**_Lien Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary provisions for a New York (U.S.) law intercreditor_**
**_agreement, but may not contain any provisions that seek to address European, Canadian or other non-New_**
**_York (U.S.) law insolvency and restructuring considerations typically available in European, Canadian or_**
**_other non-New York (U.S.) law intercreditor agreements._**

The rights of the holders of the notes in the Shared Collateral (including the right to exercise remedies) will be

subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to be entered among the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent (and,
to the extent the New Term Loan Facility is documented as a separate pari passu facility, the collateral agent under
the New Term Loan Facility), the Notes Collateral Agent and any representative for the holders of future pari passu
obligations. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Shared
Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Shared
Collateral or to control such proceedings, will be at the direction of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the
earlier to occur of (x) the discharge of the obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (which
discharge does not include certain refinancings of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and (y) 180 days after
the occurrence of an event of default under (i) to the extent the New Term Loan Facility is documented as a separate
pari passu facility, (A) prior to the discharge of the obligations under the New Term Loan Facility, that facility and
(B) from and after the discharge of the obligations under the New Term Loan Facility, the agreement governing the
series of first priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured
by a first-priority lien on the Shared Collateral (excluding the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and, otherwise,
(ii) the agreement governing the series of first priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal
amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Shared Collateral (excluding the Credit Facilities) and,
in each case, the acceleration of such applicable indebtedness; provided the representative of such indebtedness has
complied with the applicable notice provisions and that the event of default is continuing at the end of such 180-day
period and; provided further that such 180-day period will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to
have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent has
commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or (2) at any time the
grantor of the security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to)
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

At any time that the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent does not have the right to take action with respect to the

Shared Collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as described above, then the authorized
representative for the series of notes or other debt that has the greatest outstanding principal amount would exercise
such right to take action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, none of the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee (as defined under

“Description of Notes”) or the holders of the notes may object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition or
commencement of any other insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding to (i) any proposed debtor-inpossession financing or to the use of cash collateral that is not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral
agent or (ii) the use of the Shared Collateral to secure debtor in possession financing, subject to certain specified
conditions and limited exceptions. After the filing of any bankruptcy petition or the commencement of any other
insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding, the value of the Shared Collateral could materially deteriorate,
and holders of the notes would be prohibited from raising an objection to such proposed financing or use of cash
collateral. For a description of important waivers by holders of the notes and limits on their rights as secured
creditors under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement see “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—
Intercreditor Agreement.”

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by New York law and will contain customary

provisions for such intercreditor agreements governing priority of claims among secured creditors. See “Description
of Notes—Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.” While a number of the Note Guarantors are
incorporated, organized, or have their center of main interest in jurisdictions other than the United States, including,
Austria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland, the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement may not contain provisions that typically would be included in similar documents in these
and other local jurisdictions (other than certain provisions relating to release of claims upon the disposition of
collateral comprised of the equity interests of the issuer, a guarantor or a parent entity thereof, as described in
“Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement”). For example, a typical European
intercreditor agreement may include parties that would not be party to a customary New York law intercreditor
agreement, including certain unsecured creditors, and would address, on a contractual basis, certain European
insolvency and restructuring considerations which arise in the absence of consistent statutory provisions in Europe
equivalent to the framework under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”),
including, among others, provisions on standstill on the enforcement of liens on assets and on the making of claims
on direct debt obligations and guarantees, release or forced transfer of junior debt claims upon the occurrence of
“distressed disposals” during a restructuring or enforcement process and debt purchase options.

**_The lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents entered_**
**_into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to the creation_**
**_and priority of liens in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, charged and/or assigned, will give it,_**
**_in many cases, as a matter of law, junior priority to the rights of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent. In_**
**_such cases, holders of the notes will have to rely on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to provide equal_**
**_priority liens on such assets subject to applicable law in such local jurisdictions, as the case may be. In_**
**_addition, certain assets in certain foreign jurisdictions are not capable of being pledged, charged and/or_**
**_assigned to more than one party at the same time and, as a result, in such jurisdictions, such assets are_**
**_pledged, charged and/or assigned to the lenders under the Credit Agreement but will not be pledged, charged_**
**_and/or assigned for the benefit of holders of the notes. Certain local law Collateral will include limitations as to_**
**_the extent of secured obligations due to local corporate law and other local limitations._**

In addition, the lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security

documents entered into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to
the creation and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, charged and/or assigned,
will give it, in many cases, as a matter of law, junior priority to the rights of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent.
As a result, the first priority lien of the holders of the notes with respect to the Shared Collateral will be dependent
on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide that the rights of the holders of the notes with respect
to the Shared Collateral will be secured on a first priority basis and to which the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
will be a party. Such agreement may not be recognized in certain jurisdictions.

Certain of the Collateral that has been pledged, charged and/or assigned to the Credit Agreement Collateral

Agent may not, pursuant to certain laws governing such collateral, the applicable security documents or local
practice applicable to such Collateral, be capable of being pledged, charged and/or assigned and/or perfected (as
applicable) at the same time to the Notes Collateral Agent. The Credit Agreement Collateral Agent holds a lien on
such assets on behalf of the lenders under the Credit Agreement, but will not be holding a lien on such assets or be
acting as agent for the benefit of the holders of the notes with respect to such Collateral under such local laws. In
such cases, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will have a lien on such assets and the holders of the notes will
not have lien on such assets. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—General.”


-----

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral. The lien on Collateral will be released under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral that will secure the notes after the Issue Date has been or will be

made in connection with this offering of notes and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations
based on factors that include, among others, market and other economic conditions, including the availability of
suitable buyers. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the Collateral as of the date of this offering
memorandum exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral and the
guarantees could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our
business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be
sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the
amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral and the guarantees and the obligations
under the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness
and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and
accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest, fees and expenses may
cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or initiated. Also, any use,
sale, or lease or other disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding outside of the
ordinary course of our business would require prior approval from the court (which may not be given under the
circumstances).

To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral, such third parties may have rights and

remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. In
addition, the existence of certain permitted liens, or releases of Collateral under the Credit Agreement, will cause the
relevant assets to become Excluded Assets (as defined under “Description of Notes”), which will not secure the
notes or the guarantees related thereto. Additionally, the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes will allow
us to issue additional notes and additional debt that may rank pari passu with the notes and incur refinancing
indebtedness in certain circumstances. The indenture that will govern the notes will not require that we maintain the
current level of collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the indenture that will
govern the notes any such additional notes issued pursuant to such indenture and refinancing indebtedness or other
additional debt incurred in accordance with the terms of such indenture will rank pari passu with the notes and be
entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt
and refinancing indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of
the notes from the then existing pool of Collateral. In addition to releases upon any assets becoming Excluded
Assets, releases of Collateral from the liens securing the notes will be permitted under certain other circumstances.
See “Description of Notes.”

In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets,

whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously
unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.
Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, under the
terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the claims of the holders of the notes to the proceeds thereof will
rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The
security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent is subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agent may need to obtain the
consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. The Notes Collateral Agent may not be
able to obtain any such consent. Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when required
to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on the Collateral. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the
ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections_**
**_that may exist in respect of the security interests under the Credit Agreement._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections

that may exist in respect of the security interests under the Credit Agreement. In addition, foreign security filings
outside of the United States in respect of the security interests of the notes will only be made in jurisdictions (and in
the manner) where such security filings have been made under the Credit Agreement. The existence of any such


-----

exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections or lack of filings could adversely affect the value
of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the
benefit of the holders of the notes. The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any
negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections, including the lack of any
such filing in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States, and the existence thereof could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for
the benefit of the holders of the notes.

**_Rights of the holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on_**
**_certain Collateral acquired in the future._**

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest,

such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. The Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will not monitor, or we
may not inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisitions of property and rights that
constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such afteracquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition
of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the
notes against third parties. As a result, the inability or failure of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor to promptly take
all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the
priority, or a defect in the perfection, of the security interest for the benefit of the noteholders to which they would
have been otherwise entitled. In addition, as described further herein, even if the liens on Collateral acquired in the
future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge, charge or assignment of Collateral or
guarantee provided after the Issue Date might be avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy.”

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either

uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds
will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any
of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the
secured obligations, including the notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including Excluded_**
**_Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral._**

Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Agreement and local Collateral

Documents, following closing, the security documents will allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long
as no default or event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes would result therefrom, we may,
among other things, subject to the terms of the local Collateral Documents, without any release or consent by the
Trustee, conduct activities with respect to Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing
of Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on the Collateral will,
subject to the terms of the local Collateral Documents, be automatically released upon any permitted disposition
thereof to a person that is not the Issuer or a Note Guarantor. See “Description of Notes.”

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral. See “Description of

Notes—Security for the Notes” for the definition of “Excluded Assets.”

**_Security interests in certain Collateral will not be in place by the Issue Date or will not be perfected by the Issue_**
**_Date. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the Issue Date of the notes increases the risk that_**
**_such security interests could be avoided._**

Certain security interests in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, including, but not limited to, liens on Collateral

not owned by the Issuer or the Note Guarantors organized in the United States, may not be in place and/or perfected
as of closing. In addition, to the extent that any guarantees by Note Guarantors outside of the United States are not in


-----

place as of the closing, security interests in respect of Collateral owned by such Note Guarantors will similarly not
be in place. See “—Certain guarantees may not be in place by the Issue Date.”

With respect to any liens on or security interests in the Collateral that are not created or perfected on or prior to

closing, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests created or perfected
within 120 days of closing (as such date may be extended by the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement).
It will not be a default or event of default under the indenture for the notes if we are unable to create or perfect such
security interests by the applicable deadline, or thereafter, so long we have used commercially reasonable efforts to
do so. Under U.S. bankruptcy law, to the extent a security interest in certain Collateral is granted or perfected after
the date which is 30 days following the Issue Date, that security interest would remain at risk of being avoided as a
preferential transfer by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by certain
of our other creditors) if we were to file for bankruptcy within 90 days after the grant or after perfection (or, under
certain circumstances, up to one year thereafter). Other jurisdictions where the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will
pledge, charge and/or assign assets have similar and sometimes longer hardening periods.

Similarly, in other countries, there are a number of remedies under applicable legislation available to a trustee in

bankruptcy, creditors of the debtor, other court appointed officer and other interested parties to seek to set aside or
void a future pledge, charge and/or assignment of collateral for existing indebtedness. See “—Each guarantee of the
notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to
certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. laws allow courts, under certain
circumstances, to avoid the notes or the guarantees and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the
holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make
payments in respect of the notes.” See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_Any future pledge, charge or assignment of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Issue Date might be_**
**_avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy._**

The indenture that will govern the notes and the Collateral Documents will require us to cause any subsidiary

that borrows under or guarantees the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or that guarantees certain other
indebtedness we may incur, to provide a guarantee of the notes and will require us to cause such subsidiary
guarantors to grant liens on certain assets that we or any such subsidiary guarantor holds at the time the notes are
issued or acquires after the Issue Date. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the holders of the notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee
in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity
granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made
within 90 days before that entity commenced a U.S. bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before the commencement
of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the
Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the notes to
receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such
guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the Issue Date may be
treated under U.S. bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In U.S.
bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection or the issuance of a guarantee, a lien given to
secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as
a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Issue Date (or within a 30-day
safe harbor provided for in the Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if the Issuer or any Note Guarantor were to file for
U.S. bankruptcy protection after the Issue Date with respect to the notes being offered hereby and the liens had been
perfected or the guarantees issued less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such
liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a
result of having been delivered after the Issue Date. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, the holders of the
notes would lose the benefit of the guarantee or the security that the guarantee or Collateral was intended to provide.
For similar considerations in other jurisdictions, see “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations
on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_Lien searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral._**

We will conduct lien searches on the Collateral in the United States (but not all other applicable jurisdictions)

and cannot guarantee that these lien searches will reveal all existing liens on the Collateral. Any existing


-----

undiscovered lien could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes or the guarantees and
could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral.
In addition, certain statutory priority liens may also exist that cannot be discovered by lien searches.

**_The security interests over the Collateral will be granted to the Notes Collateral Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the notes and the concept of “trust” is not recognized in certain jurisdictions. The ability of the_**
**_Notes Collateral Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

In certain jurisdictions, including France, the security over the Collateral that (if and when granted) will

constitute security for the obligations under the notes and the indenture related thereto will not be granted directly to
the holders of the notes but only in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent or beneficiaries of parallel debt or analogous
obligations, or “parallel debt.” This parallel debt is created to satisfy a requirement under the applicable laws that the
Notes Collateral Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be treated as if it were a creditor of the relevant
security provider. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations under the
indenture that will govern the notes and the notes, or the “principal obligations.” Any payment in respect of the
principal obligations shall discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt
shall discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Although the Notes Collateral Agent will have, pursuant to
the parallel debt, a claim for the full principal amount of the notes, holders of the notes bear some risks associated
with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Notes Collateral Agent. The parallel debt obligations referred to
above will be contained in the indenture that will govern the notes, which will governed by New York law. There is
no assurance that such a structure will be effective before applicable courts as there is no judicial or other guidance
as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.

The pledges governed by French law will be granted in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the

secured creditors and will directly secure the parallel debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the
notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Trustee under the applicable indenture,
who will (subject to the provisions of the indenture) provide instruction to the applicable Notes Collateral Agent
(even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de

_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-_
25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could
validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort
may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1,1985 on the law applicable
to trusts and on their recognition (the “Trust Convention”), and two réponses ministérielles dated January 24, 2008
and January 8, 2009 indicated its reluctance to do so to avoid conflicts between the “trust” and the French fiducie, so
that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—
France.”

**_Rights of the holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and insolvency_**
**_proceedings and the holders of the notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses or other_**
**_adequate protection in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral is likely to be significantly

impaired, and at a minimum delayed if U.S. bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or
possibly even after the Notes Collateral Agent has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the Bankruptcy
Code, an automatic stay of actions, including enforcement upon collateral, is imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, and
secured creditors, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, are prohibited from foreclosing upon or otherwise
repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed
from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could
be delayed). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the
proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt
instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate
protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured
creditor’s interest in collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security,
if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of collateral as a result of


-----

the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy
case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the
value of its collateral if the value of such collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise
definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is
impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral
Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case,
or whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of
value of the Collateral through “adequate protection” or otherwise.

Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to

repay all amounts due on the notes and any additional obligations secured by first priority liens on the Collateral,
including interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees, the holders of the notes would have “undersecured claims” as
to the difference. U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs,
expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of
a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate
protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured portion of the notes. In addition, if any
payments of post-petition interest or other adequate protection had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal
amount of the notes. See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a discussion of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
arrangement and similar laws of other jurisdictions to which the Issuer or a Note Guarantor could become subject.

In addition, as set forth above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the ability of

the holders of the notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or use of cash collateral unless the
controlling collateral agent opposes or objects thereto or certain limited specified conditions are not satisfied.

Moreover, certain provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may limit the Notes Collateral Agent’s

voting rights on a proposal or plan of arrangement and may limit the Notes Collateral Agent’s ability to seek other
protection for the holders of the notes. See “Description of Notes.”

**_Enforcing your rights against the Company, as guarantor, or under the guarantees of the notes by certain of_**
**_our foreign subsidiaries or under the Collateral Documents across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Company and certain of our existing subsidiaries that will also guarantee the notes and provide collateral

for the notes are organized in multiple jurisdictions, including Austria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Finland, France,
Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could
be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of any future guarantor of the notes,
such that it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Your rights under the notes and the
guarantees (and, as applicable, the Collateral Documents) will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions,
and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar
proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and
often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. Also, the bankruptcy and
insolvency laws of such other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as, or be in conflict
with, the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar. For a further
discussion of these laws, see “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

In addition, while the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will agree, in accordance with the terms of the indenture

that will govern the notes, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture
that will govern the notes or the notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an agent
designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or
proceedings, it may be difficult for holders of the notes to effect service within the U.S. upon directors, officers and
experts who are not residents of the U.S. in order to institute actions in U.S. courts predicated solely upon civil
liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. There may be doubt as to the
enforceability in non-U.S. jurisdictions in original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts,
of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. You


-----

should not assume that the non-U.S. jurisdictions: (a) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions
against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws
of any state within the U.S.; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such persons predicated upon
civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.
See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_You may have difficulty enforcing U.S. bankruptcy and insolvency laws._**

Under the Bankruptcy Code, U.S. bankruptcy courts are given jurisdiction over a debtor’s property wherever it

is located, including property situated in other countries.

However, courts outside of the U.S. may not recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly,

you may have difficulty administering a U.S. bankruptcy case or a ruling of a U.S. bankruptcy court involving the
Issuer or any Note Guarantors organized outside of the U.S., because their center of main interest and/or the
substantial majority of their respective property are located outside of the U.S. Any orders or judgments of a
bankruptcy court in the U.S. may not be enforceable against the Issuer or the Note Guarantors organized outside of
the U.S. with respect to their respective property located outside the U.S.

Similar difficulties may arise in administering bankruptcy or insolvency cases in other jurisdictions.

In addition, there are differences between the bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate reorganization, foreign

exchange, administration and other laws of Austria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United States and other jurisdictions of potential future guarantors, including in respect of creditors’
rights and remedies, priority of creditors, priority claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration
of insolvency or other proceedings, and any such differences may be material. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_Each guarantee of the notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. laws_**
**_allow courts, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes or the guarantees and any related security or take_**
**_other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note_**
**_Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the notes._**

The notes will be guaranteed by each of the Note Guarantors (subject to certain limitations described under “—

Certain guarantees may not be in place by the Issue Date.”). Each Note Guarantor, jointly and severally, will
guarantee the payment of the notes on a first lien, senior secured basis and will provide the holders of the notes, the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, with a direct claim against each relevant Note Guarantor. However, the
indenture will provide that each guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the
relevant Note Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee, as it relates to that Note Guarantor, avoidable or
otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain
generally available defenses. The indenture will also permit guarantees and security by foreign subsidiaries to be
limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the
guarantees and such security.

Enforcement of any of the guarantees against any Note Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to

Note Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate
purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, transfer at undervalue, avoidable preference, insolvency or
bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The Issuer or its creditors or the
creditors of one or more Note Guarantors could challenge the issuances of any of the notes or the guarantees and any
related security as fraudulent transfers, conveyances or preferences, transfers at under value or on other grounds
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or other applicable law. If one or more of these laws and defenses are
applicable, a Note Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its guarantee depending on the
amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New
York courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of any guarantee against any Note Guarantor.
See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the


-----

Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to certain foreign
subsidiaries.

A court could avoid the obligations under the notes or any guarantee and any related security or take other

actions detrimental to the holders of the notes if, among other things, it were to determine that the Issuer or the
applicable Note Guarantor:

  - issued the notes or guarantee or any related security with the intent to prefer or defeat, hinder, delay or
defraud its existing or future creditors; or

  - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the notes or the
guarantee or any related security; and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes
or the guarantee or any related security, (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of
the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or any related security granted by any of our

subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture that will govern the notes, which will also subject to the risk of being avoided
as a preference to the extent they are issued after the date this offering closes. See “—Any future pledge, charge or
assignment of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Issue Date might be avoided by us or by a trustee in
bankruptcy” and “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,

property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Note Guarantor did not
receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the extent such Note
Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the notes. Thus, if the guarantees were
legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the benefit
of the Issuer, and only indirectly for the benefit of such Note Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Note
Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could
void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related security), subordinate them to the Note Guarantor’s other
debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer or conveyance, transfer at undervalue or

other laws vary depending upon the law being applied in any particular proceeding, such that we cannot assure you
which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Note Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or
that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Note Guarantor was insolvent on that
date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Note Guarantor was insolvent on the date its
guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the notes constituted avoidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances on other grounds under U.S. or other applicable law, or that the issuance of the notes and the
guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or the Note Guarantor’s other debt. Generally, a Note
Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets or fair value of its property was less than the amount that would
be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of

the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

The liability of each Note Guarantor under its guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such

guarantee not constituting an avoidable preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or improper
corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside (although this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to
protect the guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws). However, there can be no assurance as to


-----

what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Note Guarantor. There
is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

Under U.S. law, to the extent a court avoids a guarantee and any related security as a fraudulent transfer or

conveyance or preference or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the notes would cease to have
any direct claim against the Note Guarantor that delivered the guarantee and would be creditors solely of the Issuer
and, if applicable, of any Note Guarantor under the relevant guarantee which has not been avoided.

In the event that any guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the notes would be, to the extent

of such invalidity or unenforceability, structurally subordinated to all liabilities and preferred stock of the applicable
Note Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the notes or any guarantee is found to be a
preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay
in full any amounts outstanding under the notes. Similar limitations could apply in other jurisdictions. See “Annex
A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Security Interests” for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to certain foreign subsidiaries.

In addition, any payment by the Issuer, or a Note Guarantor pursuant to the notes or a Note Guaranty made at a

time that the Issuer or such Note Guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned
to the Issuer or such Note Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such party’s creditors if such payment is made to
an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such
payment would give such party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution in a hypothetical
Chapter 7 case under the Bankruptcy Code (in certain cases, subject to certain defenses).

Finally, as a court of equity, a United States bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect

of the notes to other claims against the Issuer under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines
that: (i) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted
in injury to the Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the notes; and
(iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, restricts the manner in which we conduct business._**

As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, the Issuer

and the Note Guarantors would have had $1.991 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness,
$1.941 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness, and approximately $604 million would have been
available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we had no
subordinated indebtedness outstanding. We may incur additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit
to meet future financing needs, subject to certain restrictions and prohibitions under the agreements governing our
indebtedness, including the indenture that will govern the notes, which would increase our total debt. This additional
debt may be substantial and some of this indebtedness may be secured.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants which impose certain limitations on

the way we conduct our business, including limitations on the amount of additional debt we are able to incur,
prohibitions on incurring additional debt if certain financial covenants are not met and restrictions on our ability to
make certain investments and other restricted payments. Any additional debt, to the extent we are able to incur it,
may further restrict the manner in which we conduct business. Such restrictions, prohibitions and limitations could
impact our ability to implement elements of our strategy in the following ways:

  - our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms or at all could be limited;

  - there may be instances in which we are unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our debt
agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required payments on our debt, which circumstances may
result in the acceleration of the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness (which we may not
have the ability to pay);

  - there may be instances in which we are unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our debt
agreements, at which time we may be prohibited from incurring any additional debt until such covenants
are met;


-----

  - we may issue debt or equity securities or sell some of our assets (subject to certain restrictions under our
existing indebtedness) to meet payment obligations or to reduce our financial leverage, and we cannot
assure you whether such transactions will be on favorable terms;

  - our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the pharmaceutical and
medical device industries may be compromised; and

  - we may be put at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as much debt as we
have, and competitors that may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.

**_To service our debt, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash_**
**_depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt_**
**_service obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and_**
**_results of operations and could cause the market value of the notes to decline._**

After giving effect to the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, we will have a significant amount of

indebtedness. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend principally upon our future operating
performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which
are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash
flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as
refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise
additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our
financial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of
those capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to
refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to
comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate
sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations and could cause the market value of the notes to decline.

Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability

to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or
may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each
subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our
ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain non-guarantor subsidiaries include non-U.S. subsidiaries that
may be prohibited by law or other regulations from distributing funds to us and/or we may be subject to payment of
taxes and withholdings on such distributions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries
or receive cash via services rendered and intellectual property licensed, we may be unable to make required
principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.

Our ability to reduce our outstanding indebtedness after consummating the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering

Transactions will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to access the capital
markets to refinance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in the amount of our
cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that could improve our
competitive position and results of operations.

**_The Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will impose restrictive and, in_**
**_the case of the Credit Agreement, financial covenants on us. Our failure to comply with these covenants could_**
**_trigger events, which could result in the acceleration of the related debt, a cross-default or cross-acceleration to_**
**_other debt, foreclosure upon any collateral securing the debt and termination of any commitments to lend, each_**
**_of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of_**
**_operations and would cause the market value of the notes to decline and could lead to bankruptcy or liquidation._**

The Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain covenants that

restrict the way we conduct business and require us to satisfy certain financial tests in order to incur debt or take
other actions.


-----

Our indebtedness contains financial or other covenants that limit our operational flexibility in a number of other

ways, including:

  - causing us to be less able to take advantage of business opportunities, such as making certain investments
and other restricted payments and engaging in mergers, acquisitions consolidations and amalgamations, and
to react to changes in market or industry conditions;

  - increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;

  - affecting our ability to pay or refinance debts as they become due during adverse economic, financial
market, and industry conditions;

  - requiring us to use a portion of cash flow for debt service, reducing funds available for other purposes;

  - decreasing our profitability and/or cash flow;

  - causing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; and

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.

The New Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to, if, as

of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company, commencing with the last day of the first full fiscal quarter
after the Issue Date for so long as any indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding,
maintain (i) a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of not greater than 5.00:1.00 and (ii) a minimum interest
coverage ratio of not less than 2.00:1.00, which shall increase to 2.25:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending December
31, 2025 and shall further increase to 2.50:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2026. The financial
covenant contains a customary term loan facility standstill and customary cure rights.

Further, our borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have Euro Interbank Offered Rate

(“EURIBOR”)-based and/or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)-based interest rates. SOFR is a relatively
new reference rate, has a very limited history and is based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury
securities. Changes in SOFR and EURIBOR can be volatile and difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of
interest we may pay on our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities is difficult to predict.

We can make no assurance that we will be able to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants contained

in the Credit Agreement and the indenture in the future. If we fail to comply with the financial maintenance
covenant, we would be in default, and our lenders would be permitted to accelerate our debt unless we could obtain
an amendment. If our debt was accelerated, we would not have sufficient funds to repay our debt absent a
refinancing, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain a refinancing.

Our inability to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments could lead to a default or an event of default

under the terms thereof, for which we may need to seek relief from our lenders and noteholders in order to waive the
associated default or event of default and avoid a potential acceleration of the related indebtedness or cross-default
or cross-acceleration to other debt. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such relief on
commercially reasonable terms or otherwise and we may be required to incur significant additional costs. In
addition, the lenders under the Credit Agreement may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us as
a condition to granting any such waiver.

If an event of default is not cured or is not otherwise waived, a majority of lenders in principal amount under the

Credit Agreement (or, with respect to an event of default with respect to the financial covenant, a majority of lenders
in principal amount and commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility) or the Trustee or holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the notes offered hereby may accelerate the maturity of the related debt under these
agreements, foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt and terminate any commitments to lend, any of which
would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and
would cause the market value of our securities, including the notes, to decline. Furthermore, under these
circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations and we may be
unable to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In such circumstances, we could be forced
into bankruptcy or liquidation and, as a result, investors could lose all or a portion of their investment in the notes.


-----

**_The assets of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors will be subject to claims by creditors of those_**
**_subsidiaries. The notes will be structurally subordinated to all such claims._**

You will not have a claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes. Not all of

our subsidiaries will guarantee the notes and our subsidiaries that do guarantee the notes may obtain releases of their
guarantees as set forth in the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes—Note Guarantees.”
Therefore, the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will be subject to claims by creditors of those subsidiaries,
whether secured or unsecured. In addition, unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture that will govern the notes
will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture. Except for the Note Guarantors, our subsidiaries will have no
obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available to pay those
amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. The notes will therefore be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, preferred stock and other obligations of any non-guarantor
subsidiary such that, in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding
up of any such subsidiary, all of such subsidiary’s creditors and preferred stockholders would be entitled to payment
in full out of such subsidiary’s assets before the holders of the notes would be entitled to any payment. The
indenture that will govern the notes will permit non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt, subject to
specified limits, and will not limit their ability to incur liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2022, on a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented 19.4% of assets and
23.0% of liabilities, to which the notes will be structurally subordinated. For the year ended December 31, 2022, on
a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented 41.6% of our net sales and 48.4% of our
EBITDA.

**_We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in the indenture that will govern the notes and the agreements governing our other

outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement, we may incur significant additional debt, including
secured debt that could share in the Collateral that will secure the notes. As of September 30, 2023, after giving
effect to the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors would have had
$1.991 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, $1.941 billion of which would have been
secured indebtedness, and approximately $604 million would have been available for borrowing under the New
Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we had no subordinated debt outstanding. Although the terms
of the Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional debt, including secured debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, including
our ability under certain circumstances to enter into New Senior Secured Credit Facilities that are secured by all of
our and our subsidiaries’ assets, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we
and our restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional debt, the related risks that we face could intensify. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_Certain guarantees may not be in place by the Issue Date._**

Guarantees by certain Note Guarantors outside of the United States in favor of the holders of the notes may not

be in place as of the Issue Date. We intend to cause such Note Guarantors to provide guarantees as promptly as
practicable thereafter, and the indenture will require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
guarantees to be issued within 120 days after the Issue Date. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on
or prior to that date or at all, and our failure to do so will not result in a default under the indenture. To the extent
that any guarantees by Note Guarantors outside of the United States are not in place as of the Issue Date, security
interests in respect of Collateral owned by such Note Guarantors may similarly not be in place. See “—Security
interests in certain Collateral will not be in place by the Issue Date or will not be perfected by the Issue Date.
Creation or perfection of such security interests after the Issue Date of the notes increases the risk that such security
interests could be avoided” and “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

In addition, during the period in which the guarantees of such Note Guarantors are not in place following the

closing date, the notes and the guarantees that are in place as of the Issue Date will be structurally subordinated
during such period to all existing and future indebtedness, preferred stock and other liabilities of the Note
Guarantors that do not guarantee the notes as of the Issue Date, including with respect to the indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement. As described further herein, any guarantees by Note Guarantors that are put in place following
the Issue Date may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under


-----

certain circumstances. See “⸺Any future pledge, charge or assignment of Collateral or guarantee provided after the
Issue Date might be avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy” and “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations
and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes if it experiences a Change of Control or, under certain_**
**_circumstances, an Asset Sale._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes when certain

change of control events occur. If a Change of Control occurs, you will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase some or all of your notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of your notes
to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Additionally, if
the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries sells assets, under certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required
to use the net proceeds to make an offer to purchase the notes at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In the event that we experience a Change of Control or, under certain circumstances, an Asset Sale that results

in having to repurchase the notes, we may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our obligations under the
notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the Change of Control and Asset Sale covenants in the indenture that
will govern the notes offered hereby will not cover all corporate reorganizations, mergers or similar transactions and
may not provide you with protection in a highly leveraged transaction. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at
the Option of the Holders—Change of Control.”

**_The ability of holders of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase notes as a result of a disposition of_**
**_“substantially all” of the Company’s assets may be uncertain._**

The definition of Change of Control in the indenture that will govern the notes will include a phrase relating to

the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets or
properties of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such notes as a result
of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets or properties of the Company and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indenture that will govern the notes by beneficial owners_**
**_with short positions in excess of their interests in the notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the notes, each holder of notes (other than any holder that is a Regulated Bank (as defined

under “Description of Notes”)) agrees, in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction
to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder
Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent that
such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the notes (other than
screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed
solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of
Notes”) and (ii) provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to
time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request thereof.
These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a
representation.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and

applicable state securities laws and we do not currently intend to register the notes or to offer to exchange the notes
for notes registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the
notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time.
Additionally, the indenture that will govern the notes will not be subject to the provisions of the TIA. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”


-----

**_There is no established trading market for the notes. If an actual trading market does not develop for the notes,_**
**_you may not be able to resell them quickly, for the price that you paid or at all._**

The notes will constitute a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply

for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for any quotation on any automated dealer
quotation systems. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes,
but they are not obligated to do so. Each Initial Purchaser may discontinue any market making in the notes at any
time, in its sole discretion, without prior notice. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading
market for the notes.

We also cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or at all, or that the prices

that you receive when you sell them will be favorable. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to
resell your notes at their fair market value, or at all. The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be
adversely affected by, among other things:

  - prevailing interest rates;

  - our operating performance and financial condition;

  - the interest of securities dealers in making a market; and

  - the market for similar securities.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused

volatility in prices of securities similar to the notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may
trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar
notes, our performance and other factors. It is possible that the market for the notes will be subject to disruptions.
Any disruptions may have a negative effect on noteholders, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

**_Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the notes._**

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently,

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the notes. These credit ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure or marketing of the notes. Agency ratings are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing
organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. There can be no
assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be
lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s judgment,
circumstances so warrant. Each of Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), S&P Global Ratings (“Standard &
Poor’s”) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) provide credit ratings with respect to the Company. Any further downgrade
in our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and may negatively impact
our ability to raise additional debt capital. If any credit rating initially assigned to the notes is subsequently lowered
or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial discount.

Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings

are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the notes, may increase our borrowing costs and
may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply from and after such time that_**
**_the notes are rated investment grade by two out of three of Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch, even if the_**
**_notes are subsequently rated below investment grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply from and after such

time that the notes are rated investment grade by two out of three of Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch. and such
covenants will not be reinstated even if the notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade. These
covenants restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or
guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, to pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital
stock or redeem or repurchase certain debt, sell assets, enter into certain merger transactions, enter into transactions
with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting the ability of subsidiaries to make distributions and enter into certain


-----

other transactions. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that the notes will
maintain such ratings. However, termination of these covenants will allow us to engage in certain actions that would
not have been permitted were these covenants in force, even if the notes are subsequently downgraded below
investment grade. In addition, many of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement will be modified if we
obtain an investment grade rating. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, after commissions and discounts and fees and expenses

incurred in connection with this offering, and proceeds from the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities to repay the
outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit facilities.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders under our existing credit facilities and,

accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. See “Plan of Distribution.”


-----

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of September 30, 2023:

  - on an actual basis;

  - on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Amer Sports IPO, as if such events had occurred on such date;
and

  - on an as further adjusted basis to also give effect to the Offering Transactions, as if such events had
occurred on such date.

Revolving Credit Facility. Currency exchange rates fluctuate. Assuming the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of
EUR 1.00 = U.S. $1.1050 in effect on December 31, 2023, as further adjusted borrowings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility would have increased by $60.7 million in order to repay the existing revolving facility
in full. The New Revolving Credit Facility will initially be comprised of a $710 million revolving credit facility
established under the Credit Agreement and we will maintain an existing $90 million bilateral credit facility
which is expected to ultimately be consolidated into a single revolving credit facility under the Credit
Agreement.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in_

_conjunction with “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information,” as well as our audited consolidated_
_financial statements and related notes thereto included in this offering memorandum. This discussion contains_
_forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from_
_those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,_
_those identified below and those discussed in “Risk Factors,” within this offering memorandum._

products including footwear and apparel. Today, Salomon is a market leader in global trail running footwear and
premium hiking footwear, with products recognized for their performance, style, durability and sustainability. Over
60% of Salomon’s revenue in 2022 came from footwear, while also having leading market positions in its legacy

including tennis, baseball and basketball, among other sports. The Wilson brand has a legacy as the top-of-the-line
sports equipment and is associated with legendary athletes, including Roger Federer, Russell Wilson and Jamal
Murray. In addition, Wilson is the official partner of professional sports leagues, including the NBA, WNBA, NFL,


-----

the US Open and Roland Garros Grand Slam Tennis Championships, as well as the NCAA, making Wilson products
integral to performance in sport. These athletes and leagues are a testament to the credibility and reputation of
Wilson’s track record of innovation and superior products.

While Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson stand tall and lead our three segments, our other brands appropriately fit

our sports-oriented portfolio. Brands such as Atomic and Peak Performance enhance our scale, competitive
positioning and diversification across sports categories. Together, our brands enable us to lead and compete in
various sports segments and drive the continued success of our portfolio.

We excel at identifying, developing and defining brands that meet our corporate vision. We empower these

brands to autonomously connect with consumers and develop products to drive growth. Our platform supports the
brands via scaled infrastructure and financial controls to accelerate performance. We believe that the size and
diversification of our platform mitigates risks and provides financial flexibility to invest prudently to meet the
continuously evolving needs of consumers, to develop competitive advantages and to drive growth across the brands
through a relentless focus on innovation. We also believe that our platform enables efficient integration, scaling and
optimization of target opportunities that fit within our portfolio, as well as critical insight to inform divestiture
decisions.

We govern our brands through management across the finance, supply chain, sustainability, communication,

legal and compliance functions, among other areas. At the same time, we enable our brands through our group’s
incubator model that provides shared learnings from data analytics across the platform as well as from the
economies of scale and synergies of shared resources, including supplier services, distribution and logistics, human
resources and enterprise IT infrastructure. We further serve our brands through access to shared, centralized business
services, including customer service and treasury management functions. All together, these resources empower our
brand leadership teams to focus on serving consumers through brand, product and go-to-market strategies that drive
performance, and our global and scaled operating model enables larger, robust brand organizations to independently
flourish.

**Our Business Model**

Our brands are guided by a consumer-first mindset and meet consumers exactly where they shop. We generate

revenue from the sale of our products through direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels:

  - **_Direct-to-Consumer includes sales of our brands’ products through (i) owned e-commerce websites and (ii)_**
owned retail stores, which include elevated brand stores that drive consumer engagement and factory outlet
stores which serve as a liquidation channel for us. The DTC channel accounted for 29.5% of our revenue
in 2022, 27.1 % in 2021 and 21.7% in 2020, as well as 32.8% of our revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, and 27.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

  - **_Wholesale includes sales of our brands’ products through general sporting goods retailers, specialty stores,_**
independently-operated partner stores, distributors, retailer-owned and third-party e-commerce websites as
well as revenue from certain licensing arrangements. The wholesale channel accounted for 70.5% of our
revenue in 2022, 72.9% in 2021 and 78.3% in 2020, as well as 67.2% of our revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, and 72.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

**Our Segments**

We operate our business through the following three reportable business segments, which reflect how we cluster

our brands on the basis of similar consumer, product, marketing and operating factors:

  - **_Technical Apparel. Technical Apparel includes outdoor apparel, footwear and accessories and consists of_**
our Arc’teryx and Peak Performance brands.

  - **_Outdoor Performance. Outdoor Performance includes outdoor apparel, footwear, accessories and winter_**
sports equipment and consists of our Salomon, Atomic, Armada and ENVE brands.

  - **_Ball & Racquet Sports. Ball & Racquet Sports includes sports equipment, apparel and accessories and_**
consists of our Wilson, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield and ATEC brands, all of which we refer
to as the Wilson Sporting Goods portfolio.

For additional information about our three reportable business segments, see “Business — Our Brands and

Products,” Note 4, “Segment Reporting,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and Note 3, “Segment
Reporting,” to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant

opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section of this
offering memorandum titled “Risk Factors.”

**_Ability to Innovate and Develop Products_**

We believe that product innovation lives at the center of who we are as a company and our brands are

relentlessly focused on designing innovative and high-quality products that our consumers demand. Our innovation
process leverages our brand specific innovation centers and our dedicated research and design employees, many of
whom use our products to participate in sports and outdoor activities. We also collaborate closely with our
professional athlete brand ambassadors, who provide valuable insights into product design and performance that is
used to inform and improve our innovation process. Further, our global DTC platform allows us to leverage datadriven insights from consumers across our brands to improve product development and innovation. This process and
feedback loop allows us to drive innovation across our brands’ existing product categories to deliver cutting-edge
performance for consumers globally.

We believe our brands’ core product portfolios provide a base for growth and we are continuously evaluating

opportunities to improve those products through innovation. Historically, we have successfully expanded our
brands’ product categories by leveraging our innovation capabilities along with our strong brand equity and we
intend to continue developing and introducing new products into underpenetrated and growing categories,
particularly soft goods, across our brands. Nonetheless, developing new products is a complex, time-consuming
process and may require significant capital investment. A new product may not achieve a successful launch or may
not generate sufficient consumer interest and market acceptance to become a profitable product in the expected time
frame, for the expected cost, or at all. In order to remain competitive within the product markets, distribution
channels and geographies we currently compete in, we must continue to invest in innovation and develop, promote
and bring to market new high-quality products.

**_Ability to Execute Our Multi-Channel Strategy_**

Our brand-direct operating model allows our brands to execute their own curated go-to-market strategy to best

align with their consumers’ shopping behavior. Since the Acquisition in 2019, we have evolved our go-to-market
strategy to emphasize a closer connection with our consumers through various distribution channels. We have
experienced growth in the DTC channel across both owned retail and e-commerce, driven primarily by our
Technical Apparel segment, led by the Arc’teryx brand, as well as our Outdoor Performance segment to a lesser
extent. Since January 1, 2019, we have increased our net store count to over 330 owned retail stores as of September
30, 2023, representing an increase of approximately 69%. We believe we have the opportunity to significantly
increase the number of new stores globally across our brands. Our owned retail stores, particularly Arc’teryx stores,


-----

have demonstrated strong productivity levels and our owned retail rollout strategy looks to repeat and improve store
productivity in the future. In addition, e-commerce has grown from 11.2% of our revenue in 2020 to 14.5% in 2022
and has further grown to 14.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and we believe we have significant
runway to expand our digital penetration as we grow our brands’ awareness across geographies. We believe our
DTC strategy provides significant benefits including the ability to personalize and control the consumer experience,
generate impactful consumer data insights, capture a larger share of the value chain and improve gross margins in
certain geographies, and certain brands and channels, highlighted to date by our Arc’teryx retail store rollout. We
generally experience higher gross margins in our DTC channel. Effective implementation of our DTC strategy is
integral to the continued growth of our business but it also involves continued investment. As we further penetrate
the DTC channel, we expect additional capital expenditures to support our ongoing global owned retail store rollout.

Our Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports segments primarily operate through the wholesale

channel. The brands within these segments partner with strategic, premium wholesale partners such as well-known
sporting goods retailers and specialty retailers dedicated to outdoor activities such as running. These wholesale
partners provide access to our target consumers and drive brand awareness. While we expect to further penetrate the
DTC channel across all our brands, including those within the Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports
segments, the wholesale channel will remain an integral part of our go- to-market strategy and overall growth
opportunity, and we intend to maintain our relationships with our wholesale partners and continue to provide new
and innovative products as well as brand marketing within the channel.

**_Ability to Grow into New Geographies_**

Our market expansion strategy has been a key driver of our recent revenue growth and we have identified

additional sizable, growing and underpenetrated geographic markets where we plan to continue to execute our
expansion strategy, most notably in North America, Europe and Greater China. Across all of our brands’ markets,
we plan to focus on increasing brand awareness, deepening DTC penetration, and optimizing our relationships with
key wholesale partners as market conditions permit. We have demonstrated that we have the capabilities to drive
growth in various geographic markets; however, our ability to successfully expand our business will depend on a
number of factors, including our innovation, marketing efforts and consumer acceptance of our products. We expect
that selling and marketing expenses to support these initiatives will continue to grow with anticipated revenue
growth as we scale.

**_Ability to Manage a Global Supply Chain_**

Due to the multi-brand and global nature of Amer Sports, we operate with a complex global supply chain.

While each brand manages its individual supply chain, they leverage the global scale and capabilities of the Amer
Sports platform to drive efficiency. Our platform allows us to establish strategic partnerships with key suppliers and
retail partners across multiple markets and channels, where we further leverage our scale to drive flexible
manufacturing capacity and supply chain optimization. We are focused on the continued growth of our brands’
apparel and footwear products, and as a result we expect the portion of our brands’ products being manufactured by
third parties will continue to increase. We are focused on diversifying our supplier network, maintaining multiple
manufacturing sources and expanding our distribution footprint.

However, as we continue to scale our own manufacturing facilities, third-party sourcing and logistics footprint

and distribution centers, we may be impacted by increased costs relating to our expansion efforts, including with
respect to raw materials, labor, transportation and sustainability initiatives in an evolving regulatory and public
opinion environment. Disruptions in our supply chain operations due to these or other factors could result in product
shortages, declining sales, reputational damage or significant costs. Additionally, increasing geopolitical tensions
could result in difficulty utilizing our global supply chain, whether due to sanctions, tariffs, or public perceptions of
our operations in certain countries. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers
— Increasing restrictions or additional requirements on products from certain areas, such as the U.S. Uyghur Forced
Labor Prevention Act, may require us to incur additional costs, disrupt our value chain, or otherwise adversely
impact our operations and financial condition.”


-----

**_Ability to Manage Inventory_**

Our ability to grow has been, and will continue to be, dependent on the availability of the right inventory at the

right time, at the right place. Our global, data-driven approach to demand planning together with an integrative
approach between sales, demand, and supply planning has enabled rapid growth while maintaining premium brand
positioning. Incorrect inventory levels could result in missed sales opportunities, higher expenses, including higher
freight costs due to a higher share of air-freighted product and increased distribution costs, and higher discounts
towards wholesale partners and consumers, as well as higher or lower levels of working capital.

**_Seasonality_**

We experience some seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results. Historically, we have realized a

slightly higher portion of our revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, primarily due to higher
sales through our DTC channel compared to the rest of the year and a higher share of fall and winter collections in
our Technical Apparel and Outdoor Performance segments. For example, we generated 34%, 33% and 38% of our
total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our Ball & Racquet Sports
segment is generally more consistent across fiscal quarters. Working capital requirements typically increase
throughout our second and third fiscal quarters as inventory builds to support our peak shipping and selling period
which typically occurs from August to December. Cash provided by operating activities is typically highest in our
first fiscal quarter due to the significant inflows associated with our peak selling season. We believe our strategy to
broaden our assortment within the soft goods categories across all our brands, including for example Arc’teryx’s
enhanced focus on spring and summer collections, could lead to increasingly balanced revenue and results of
operations throughout the fiscal year.

**_Foreign Currency Exposure_**

We report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars but have significant non-U.S. operations. Our

functional currency is the euro. A large portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars, in
particular the euro, the Canadian dollar and Renminbi (“RMB”), and generally the applicable local currency is our
functional currency in that locality. As a result, we face foreign currency exposure on the translation of net income,
assets and liabilities of our operations in numerous jurisdictions into U.S. dollars, including on our outstanding
indebtedness denominated in euro. In fiscal year 2022, fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, we generated 64.9%,
66.6% and 66.6%, respectively, of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which in fiscal year 2022
included 21.6% in euros, 7.5% in Canadian dollars and 14.2% in RMB. In the same respective fiscal years, our total
purchased and manufactured goods in currencies other than U.S. dollars were 18.0%, 19.9% and 24.2%, which in
fiscal year 2022 included 15.7% in euros and 1.1% in RMB. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
2022, we generated 66.8% and 62.7%, respectively, of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 18.3% in euros, 7.1% in Canadian dollars and 18.9% in RMB.
In the same respective periods, our total purchased and manufactured goods in currencies other than U.S. dollars
were 17.0% and 18.3%, which for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 15.3% in euros and 0.8% in
RMB. Given the strength of the U.S. dollar against our key foreign currencies, including the euro, the Canadian
dollar and RMB, translation into U.S. dollars, for the periods presented results in lower profitability due to foreign
currency exposure. In the future, if the U.S. dollar continues to be strong against our local currencies, we will
continue to see lower profitability due to foreign currency exposure; however, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken
against the euro or RMB, it could result in increased profitability.

Where possible, we manage foreign currency exposure through a variety of methods, including by financing

each business unit in its functional currency and concentrating cash flows through centralized entities to limit the
number of foreign currencies being utilized for purchases. Additionally, we enter into hedging arrangements to limit
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for a significant portion of our cash flows, in particular with our most
commonly used foreign currencies, including euros, Canadian dollars and RMB. Such hedging arrangements may
include foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency
swaps. The majority of our hedging arrangements are short-term and are usually rolled forward within the standard
business cycle. Nonetheless, it is not practical for us to mitigate all of our foreign currency exposure, nor are we able
to accurately predict the possible impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of
operations, due to our constantly changing exposure to various foreign currencies, difficulty in predicting
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the significant number of foreign


-----

currencies involved. As we continue to expand our global operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could
become more significant.

**_Macroeconomic Trends_**

Macroeconomic factors affect consumer spending patterns and thereby our results of operations. These factors

include general economic conditions, inflation, consumer confidence, employment rates, business conditions, the
availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, fuel, energy and freight costs and impacts of public health crises, such
as the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors that impact consumer discretionary spending, which remains volatile globally,
continue to create a complex and challenging retail environment for us and our retail partners worldwide. By
diversifying our supply chain and consumer geographical concentration, we seek to reduce our exposure to impacts
on our business from macroeconomic volatility, including as a result of economic downturns in a single region. We
intend to continue to evaluate and adjust our operating strategies to help further mitigate any impacts on our results
of operations resulting from broader macroeconomic conditions, while remaining focused on the long-term growth
of our business.

In addition, changes, potential changes or uncertainties in regulatory and economic conditions or laws and

policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries
where we operate, or sell our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. In particular, trade tensions have escalated in recent years between the United States and the PRC. There
could be legislative actions limiting outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to jurisdictions outside the
United States, including through tariffs or penalties. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our
business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes. Further, the emergence of any such trade
barriers could adversely affect our operating margins, which exceeds the margins of the business overall in the
region. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation — Changes to trade policies, tariffs,
import/export regulations and anti- competition regulations in the United States, EU, PRC and other jurisdictions, or
our failure to comply with such regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial
condition and results of operations.”

**Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Discontinued Operations_**

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we completed the divestitures of our

Suunto and Precor businesses, respectively. All income and expenses of each of the Precor and Suunto businesses
have been reported as discontinued operations for the full years 2022, 2021 and 2020, while the related assets and
liabilities have been classified as assets and liabilities held-for-sale as of December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021,
respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized impairment charges on the
carrying value of Suunto’s net assets in the amounts of $77.5 million and $20.8 million, respectively. During the
year ended December 31, 2022 we recognized a loss on disposal on the sale of our Suunto business in the amount of
$5.5 million, offset by a $4.8 million gain relating to a final purchase price adjustment relating to the Precor
divestiture. During the year ended December 31, 2021 we recognized a gain on disposal in the amount of $116.0
million upon the sale of our Precor business. See Note 29, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held
for Sale,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and Note 18, “Discontinued Operations and Assets and
Liabilities Held for Sale,” to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

**_Public Company Costs_**

Following the completion of the Amer Sports IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating

as a public company. In particular, we expect our accounting, legal and personnel-related expenses and insurance
costs to increase as we establish more comprehensive compliance and governance functions, establish, maintain and
review internal controls over financial reporting, and prepare and distribute periodic reports in accordance with SEC
rules. Our financial statements following the Amer Sports IPO will reflect the impact of these expenses.

**_Key Financial Metrics_**

Management regularly reviews a number of metrics, including the following key financial metrics, to evaluate

our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make


-----

strategic decisions. Management believes the non-IFRS financial measures presented below are useful in evaluating
our performance, in addition to our financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “—Non-IFRS Financial
Measures” for additional information on the non-IFRS financial measures and a reconciliation to the most
comparable IFRS financial measures.

(2) This is a non-IFRS financial measure. For more information regarding our use of this measure and its usefulness

to investors, as well as a reconciliation to the most comparable IFRS financial measure, see “—Non-IFRS
Financial Measures” below.

**_Constant Currency Revenue_**

As we are a global company, the comparability of our revenue reported in U.S. dollars is also affected by

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value
over time compared to the U.S. dollar. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results.
As a result, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, our revenue discussions often
contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating the current period reported
amounts using the actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior period, in place of the exchange rates in
use during the current period. For a further discussion of how we utilize, and limitations of, this non-IFRS financial
measure, see “—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”

**_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**

We define EBITDA as net loss plus income tax expense, finance cost, depreciation and amortization and minus

finance income, from both continuing and discontinued operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA with
adjustments to exclude results from discontinued operations, restructuring expenses, impairment losses on goodwill
and intangible assets, expenses related to M&A activities, expenses related to certain legal proceedings and sharebased payments. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics

of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted
EBITDA divided by revenue. For a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss and a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net loss margin and for a further discussion of how we utilize, and
limitations of, these non-IFRS measures see “—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”


-----

**_Segment Adjusted Operating Profit_**

We define Segment Adjusted Operating Profit as loss before tax for the segment plus finance cost and minus

finance income with adjustments for certain purchase price adjustments, restructuring expenses, impairment losses
on goodwill and intangible assets, expenses related to M&A activities and expenses related to certain legal
proceedings. Segment Adjusted Operating Profit is a measure of operating performance of our reportable segments
and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Segment Adjusted Operating Profit is
a performance metric utilized by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to and assess
performance of the Company’s segments. See Note 4, “Segment Reporting,” to our audited consolidated financial
statements and Note 3, “Segment Reporting,” to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, each
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Components of Our Results of Operations**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue primarily consists of sales of our products, but also includes limited services and license fees. Revenue

can fluctuate as a result of changes in volume, price, product and channel mix and foreign currency exchange rates.
Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the products or services are transferred to the customer in
accordance with the terms of delivery. Revenue from the sale of products within the DTC channel is generally
recognized upon delivery for e-commerce customers or at the point the customer purchases the goods at our owned
retail stores. Revenue within the DTC channel is revenue net of any value added tax, discounts, incentives, rebates
or estimated returns. Revenue from the sales of products within the wholesale channel is generally recognized when
the goods have been delivered to the wholesale partner’s specified location, when we deliver the goods to the carrier
or when the wholesale partner obtains the goods from our warehouses. Following delivery, the wholesale partner has
the primary responsibility for onward sales and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss. Revenue within the
wholesale channel is revenue net of any discounts, incentives or rebates. Revenue from services, which primarily
comprise freight services to customers of our goods, is recognized at the point in time upon the delivery of the goods
when the control has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from license fees is recognized as a component of
our wholesale revenue when the applicable counterparty manufactures or sells products bearing our trademarks.
License income based on fixed license agreements is recognized evenly throughout the financial year, while license
income determined by sales volumes is recognized during the financial year as the licensee generates sales revenue.

We generally offer DTC customers of our products the right to return or exchange merchandise purchased

within 14–30 days of receipt, while certain of our contracts provide wholesale partners a right to return goods within
a specified period. A refund liability is recognized as a reduction of sales and a right of return asset is recognized as
a reduction of cost of goods sold, based on both historical experience and anticipated future returns.

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold consist primarily of all costs directly related to generating revenue. Cost of goods sold can

fluctuate as a result of changes in volume, product mix, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation.

Cost of goods sold for our owned manufactured goods includes all raw materials, labor and related overhead.

Cost of goods sold for sourced goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. Overhead includes all costs
related to manufacturing or sourcing goods, including costs of planning, purchasing, quality control, depreciation
and amortization of owned manufacturing facilities and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, employee
compensation, inbound and outbound freight, duties, non-refundable taxes and shrink and valuation reserves.

**_Selling and Marketing Expenses_**

Selling expenses consist primarily of expenses to support our wholesale partner relationships and consumer

support teams and enable the delivery of products to wholesale partners and consumers through our e-commerce
platform and owned retail stores. These expenses include: personnel expenses for sales and technical
representatives, warehouses, our owned websites, processing fees in the DTC channel and depreciation expenses.

Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions, both offline and digital

campaigns as well as trade marketing and consumer marketing, including sponsorships and endorsements of our
products, as well as related overhead costs. We intend to continue to invest in our marketing capabilities in the


-----

future and expect this expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we release new products and
expand into new geographies. Marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period to
period based on total revenue and the timing of our investments in marketing functions as these investments may
vary in scope and scale over future periods.

**_Administrative and Other Expenses_**

Administrative and other expenses consist of costs incurred in our corporate offices, primarily related to

personnel costs, including salaries, variable incentive compensation, benefits, other professional service costs,
corporate facilities costs, costs related to accounting and professional fees as well as IT, depreciation, amortization
related to software and patents and other rights. We have invested considerably in this area to support the growing
volume and complexity of the business and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. In addition, in connection
with the Amer Sports IPO, we expect to incur certain transaction-related costs.

Following the Amer Sports IPO, we anticipate a significant increase in accounting, legal and professional fees

associated with being a public company. Other expenses also include research and development (“R&D”) expenses,
certain non-recurring expenses such as minor losses on sale of assets and unrealized foreign exchange losses related
to the revaluation of accounts receivable or accounts payable balances of non-operational currencies in entities
dealing with several currencies.

**_Impairment Losses_**

Impairment losses consist of impairments on goodwill and certain trademarks of the Peak Performance

business, which were recorded in 2022, a loss on receivables relating to our Mavic cycling business, which was
recorded in 2020, as well as losses on trade receivables.

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income consists of government subsidies (including COVID-19 pandemic-related subsidies and

certain other economic subsidies), insurance compensation for general business losses, gains on the sale of noncurrent assets as well as other non-recurring income, such as patent settlements.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income consists of interest earned on cash and equivalent balances and other financial income.

**_Finance Cost_**

Finance cost consists of interest cost on loans, lease obligations, pensions and derivatives, as well as foreign

exchange gains and losses and other finance costs.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Taxation consists primarily of current and deferred income tax and a small component of withholding tax.

**_Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax_**

Loss from discontinued operations consists of gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations and

operational results until the sale of businesses reported as discontinued operations.

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $703.3 million, or 29.9%, compared to the

nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in consumer demand in the Technical
Apparel segment as Greater China re-opened following the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2022, as well as increased
sales in the Outdoor Performance segment as product supply normalized following the pandemic. Revenue on a
constant currency basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $753.2 million, or 32.1%,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Revenue generated by the wholesale channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by

$340.7 million, or 19.9%, to $2,051.1 million, compared to $1,710.4 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2022, primarily driven by increased sales volume in the Technical Apparel and Outdoor Performance segments
due to supply chain recovery which allowed retailers to accelerate re-stocking. Revenue generated by the DTC
channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $362.7 million, or 56.7%, to $1,002.3 million,
compared to $639.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in
consumer demand in North America and Greater China and a net opening of 33 owned retail stores.

Revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 across all geographic regions. The Americas

grew by $198.8 million, or 19.3%, driven mainly by Technical Apparel and DTC channel growth. Greater China
grew by $239.2 million, or 67.6%, driven by increased consumer demand following the COVID-19 lockdowns in
2022, mainly in the Technical Apparel and Outdoor Performance segments. Revenue in EMEA grew by $183.9
million or 22.6%, driven by improved sales in the Outdoor Performance segment through the wholesale channel.
Revenue in Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China) grew by $81.4 million or 52.8%, driven by increased sales
volume in the Technical Apparel segment due to supply chain recovery which allowed retailers to accelerate restocking.

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $272.0 million, or 22.9%, to

$1,460.5 million, compared to $1,188.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to
volume growth driven by an increase in consumer demand across each of our reportable segments.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $431.4 million, or 37.1%, to $1,592.9

million, compared to $1,161.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Gross margin for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 was 52.2%, compared to 49.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
The increase was primarily due to channel and geographic mix improvements, which were driven in part by
increased sales through our higher gross margin DTC channel. Lower logistics costs, particularly for sea freight,
improved the gross margin compared to the prior period, but were partially offset by increases in raw material and
labor costs.

**_Selling and Marketing Expenses_**

Selling and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $202.5 million, or

26.8%, to $956.8 million, compared to $754.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Selling and
marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat from 31.3% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to 32.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in absolute costs was
driven by higher costs in our DTC channel, primarily due to a higher volume of sales, a net increase in total store


-----

count, an increase in online and offline marketing expenses, additional operating costs of e-commerce systems and
higher personnel costs from an increase in headcount.

**_Administrative and Other Expenses_**

Administrative and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $92.4 million,

or 30.8%, to $392.2 million, compared to $299.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was
primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs as we expanded our leadership teams, both at the segment and
group levels, and by increased IT investments in our SAP ERP systems to facilitate future growth.

**_Impairment Losses_**

Impairment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $3.7 million, to $4.6 million,

compared to $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily driven by an increase
in bad debt expense and related write-offs.

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $1.1 million, or 51.0%, to

$3.3 million, compared to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Other operating income in
2023 was primarily related to certain tax credits and gains on sale of property, plant and equipment.

**_Operating Profit_**

Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $133.9 million, or 123.2%, to

$242.6 million, compared to $108.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily
driven by an increase in revenue and improvements in gross margin and was offset by an increase in operating
expenses.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $2.4 million, or 115.1%, to $4.5

million, compared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily driven by
increased interest income.

**_Finance Cost_**

Finance cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $128.1 million, or 76.0%, to $296.6

million, compared to $168.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily driven by
higher interest expenses related to loans from related parties and other interest-bearing debts as a result of higher
interest rates.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $39.5 million, or 158.5%, to

$64.4 million, compared to $24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our effective income tax
rate was (130)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to (43)% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the higher taxable operating
profit.

**_Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax_**

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by

$21.8 million, to nil, compared to $21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Loss from
discontinued operations, net of tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, included losses generated by
Suunto for the period until disposal on May 6, 2022, partially offset by a gain of $4.8 million relating to a final
purchase price adjustment paid in 2022 relating to the Precor disposal.

(1) Consists of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

(2) Excludes Greater China.

Revenue for 2022 increased by $482.3 million, or 15.7%, compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in

consumer demand across each of our reportable segments driven by new product introduction, new owned retail
store openings, increased brand awareness and point of sale expansion, as well as supply chain recovery following
the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue on a constant currency basis for 2022 increased by $704.6 million, or 23.0%,
compared to 2021.

Revenue generated by the wholesale channel for 2022 increased by $266.4 million, or 11.9%, to $2,502.7

million, compared to $2,236.3 million in 2021, primarily driven by increased sales volume in the Ball & Racquet
Sports and Outdoor Performance segments as sell-through to end consumers improved and retailers accelerated the
re-stocking of products. Revenue generated by the DTC channel for 2022 increased by $215.9 million, or 26.0%, to
$1,046.1 million, compared to $830.2 million in 2021, primarily driven by a net increase of 25 owned retail stores
from the prior year period and an increase in total e-commerce sales of $109.3 million, or 27.0%, to $513.8 million
in 2022, compared to $404.4 million in 2021. This increase in total e-commerce sales was in turn driven by an 81%
increase in the total traffic to our owned e-commerce websites compared to 2021.

Revenue increased in 2022 across all geographic regions. The Americas grew by $251.4 million, or 20.1%,

driven by the strong performance of the Technical Apparel and Ball & Racquet Sports segments. Greater China
grew by $150.9 million, or 40.5%, driven by improved productivity of existing owned retail stores, higher traffic to
owned e-commerce websites, and the opening of new stores during the period. Revenue in Greater China in 2021
was impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns during the first half of the year which resulted in a decrease in consumer
traffic to our owned retail stores and disruptions in supply chain operations. Revenue in EMEA grew by $45.1
million, or 3.7%, driven by improved sales in the Outdoor Performance segment primarily through the wholesale
channel, despite the suspension of all significant commercial activities in Russia by the end of 2022. Revenue in
Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China) grew by $34.9 million, or 16.2%, driven by the broad recovery of consumer
demand across each of our reportable segments.


-----

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold for 2022 increased by $224.3 million, or 14.4%, to $1,785.2 million, compared to $1,560.9

million in 2021, primarily due to volume growth driven by an increase in consumer demand across each of our
reportable segments.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit for 2022 increased by $258.0 million, or 17.1%, to $1,763.6 million, compared to $1,505.6 million

in 2021. Gross margin for 2022 was 49.7%, compared to 49.1% for 2021. The increase was primarily due to channel
and geographic mix improvements, which were driven in part by increased sales through our higher gross margin
DTC channel, as well as pricing actions in response to increased input costs, but were partially offset by increases in
raw material costs, higher inbound freight costs to deliver products to our warehouses and foreign exchange
variances.

**_Selling and Marketing Expenses_**

Selling and marketing expenses for 2022 increased by $145.0 million, or 15.1%, to $1,107.6 million, compared

to $962.6 million in 2021. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat from
31.4% in 2021 to 31.2% in 2022. The increase in absolute costs was driven by higher costs in our DTC channel,
primarily due to a higher volume of sales, a net increase in total store count, an increase in online and offline
marketing expenses, additional operating costs from e-commerce and higher personnel costs as the result of an
increase in headcount.

**_Administrative and Other Expenses_**

Administrative and other expenses for 2022 increased by $50.7 million, or 13.9%, to $415.1 million, compared

to $364.4 million in 2021. This was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs as we expanded our
leadership teams, both at the segment and group levels, and by increased IT investments in our Technical Apparel
and Outdoor Performance segments to facilitate future growth.

**_Impairment Losses_**

Impairment losses for 2022 increased by $201.0 million, to $201.7 million, compared to $0.7 million in 2021.

This was primarily driven by a $179.0 million impairment loss on goodwill and a $19.1 million impairment loss on
certain trademarks, each recognized by our Peak Performance business unit in 2022. The impairment loss on
goodwill was recognized as a result of a challenging Nordic retail environment and slower than planned geographic
expansion of our Peak Performance business unit as compared to our original investment plans.

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income for 2022 increased by $2.4 million, or 26.7%, to $11.4 million, compared to $9.0

million in 2021. This was primarily driven by an increase in certain government economic subsidies, partly offset by
lower insurance compensation for general business losses.

**_Operating Profit_**

Operating profit for 2022 decreased by $136.3 million, or 72.9%, to $50.6 million, compared to $186.9 million

in 2021. This was primarily driven by impairment losses of $198.1 million for Peak Performance in 2022, partially
offset by an increase in revenue as described above.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income for 2022 increased by $1.0 million, or 43.5%, to $3.3 million, compared to $2.3 million in

2021. This was primarily driven by increased interest income.


-----

**_Finance Cost_**

Finance cost for 2022 decreased by $42.5 million, or 15.2%, to $236.5 million, compared to $279.0 million in

2021. This was primarily driven by a decrease in interest-bearing liabilities following the 2021 sale of Precor which
resulted in higher cash balances and a reduction of outstanding debt.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Income tax expense for 2022 increased by $13.6 million, or 39.2%, to $48.3 million, compared to $34.7 million

in 2021. Our effective income tax rate was 26% for 2022, compared to 39% in 2021. The decrease in the effective
income tax rate was primarily due to usage of net operating losses through the divestment of Precor in 2021. The
effective tax rate is significantly impacted by non-deductible interest expenses, mainly related to debt incurred by
one of our subsidiaries in 2019 in connection with the Acquisition.

**_Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax_**

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2022 increased by $20.0 million, to $21.8 million, compared

to $1.8 million in 2021. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2021 comprised (i) losses generated by
Suunto for the entire year, including an impairment loss on financial assets of $77.5 million upon classifying Suunto
as held-for-sale, and (ii) losses generated by Precor for the period until disposal on April 1, 2021, partially offset by
a gain upon disposal of Precor of $116.0 million. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2022, as compared
to the prior year period, only included losses generated by Suunto for the period until disposal on May 6, 2022,
including a loss on disposal of $5.5 million, partially offset by a gain of $4.8 million relating to a final purchase
price adjustment paid in 2022 relating to the Precor disposal.

Revenue for 2021 increased by $620.2 million, or 25.4%, compared to 2020, primarily driven by volume

recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, with growth in consumer demand across each of our reportable
segments, partially offset by the impact of significant supply chain disruptions and local lockdowns.

Revenue on a constant currency basis for 2021 increased by $536.7 million, or 21.9%, compared to 2020.


-----

Revenue generated by the wholesale channel for 2021 increased by $320.0 million, or 16.7%, to $2,236.3

million, compared to $1,916.3 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by increased sales volume in our Ball &
Racquet Sports and Outdoor Performance segments. Revenue generated by the DTC channel for 2021 increased by
$300.2 million, or 56.6%, to $830.2 million, compared to $530.0 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by
increased sales in our Technical Apparel segment, a significant recovery of owned retail stores following lockdown
closures in 2020 and a net increase in total store count of 22 owned retail stores from the prior year period. In
addition, e-commerce grew by $131.0 million or 47.9% as traffic to our owned e-commerce websites increased by
42% compared to the prior year period, in line with the shifting preference among consumers for online shopping.

Revenue increased in 2021 across all geographic regions. The Americas grew $269.0 million or 27.3%, driven

by the strong performance of the Technical Apparel and Ball & Racquet Sports segments. Greater China grew
$170.6 million or 84.3%, driven by improved productivity of existing retail stores, higher traffic to e-commerce
websites, and opening of new stores during the period. Revenue in Greater China in 2020 was impacted by COVID19 lockdowns throughout the year, which resulted in a decrease in consumer traffic to our owned retail stores and
disruptions in supply chain operations. Revenue in EMEA grew $145.2 million or 13.4%, driven by the overall
increase in sales in the Outdoor Performance segment, which was partially offset by lower consumer destination
travel, mainly for winter-related products. Revenue in Asia Pacific grew $35.4 million or 19.7%, driven by increased
consumer demand for products in the Technical Apparel and Ball & Racquet Sports segments.

**_Cost of Goods Sold_**

Cost of goods sold for 2021 increased by $263.5 million, or 20.3%, to $1,560.9 million, compared to $1,297.4

million in 2020, primarily due to volume growth driven by an increase in consumer demand across each of our
reportable segments.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit for 2021 increased by $356.7 million, or 31.0%, to $1,505.6 million, compared to $1,148.9 million

in 2020. Gross margin for 2021 was 49.1%, an improvement versus the 2020 gross margin of 47.0%. The increase
was primarily due to channel and geographic mix improvements, which were driven in part by increased sales
through our higher gross margin DTC channel, as well as pricing actions in response to increased input costs, but
were partially offset by increases in raw material costs and inbound freight costs to deliver products to our
warehouses.

**_Selling and Marketing Expenses_**

Selling and marketing expenses for 2021 increased by $229.4 million, or 31.3%, to $962.6 million, compared to

$733.2 million in 2020. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 30.0% in 2020 to
31.4% in 2021. The increase in absolute costs was driven by the reduction of COVID-19 pandemic-related
personnel savings programs, rent expense recovery and marketing collaborations. In addition, owned retail sales
costs increased period over period due to a higher volume of sales and a net increase in total store count and ecommerce sales costs increased period over period due to increased online and offline marketing expenses and
additional operating costs.

**_Administrative and Other Expenses_**

Administrative and other expenses for 2021 increased by $87.1 million, or 31.4%, to $364.4 million, compared

to $277.3 million in 2020. This increase was primarily the result of unusually low levels of administrative and other
expenses in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by temporary salary reductions, increased part-time
working arrangements and reductions in travel.

**_Impairment Losses_**

Impairment losses for 2021 decreased by $19.8 million, or 96.6%, to $0.7 million, compared to $20.5 million in

2020. This was primarily driven by a $8.2 million impairment loss recognized in 2020 on certain receivables relating
to integration services that we provided to the purchaser of our Mavic cycling business, which we sold in 2019.


-----

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income for 2021 increased by $1.8 million, or 25.0%, to $9.0 million, compared to $7.2 million

in 2020. This was primarily driven by higher government subsidies (including COVID-19 pandemic-related
subsidies and certain other economic subsidies) and an increase in insurance compensation for general business
losses.

**_Operating Profit_**

Operating profit for 2021 increased by $61.8 million, or 49.4%, to $186.9 million, compared to $125.1 million

in 2020. This was primarily due to channel and geographic mix improvements, which were driven in part by
increased sales volume through our higher gross margin DTC channel, as well as pricing actions in response to
increased input costs, but were partially offset by increases in raw material costs and inbound freight costs to deliver
products to our warehouses.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income for 2021 increased by $0.7 million, or 43.8%, to $2.3 million, compared to $1.6 million in

2020. This was primarily driven by increased interest income.

**_Finance Cost_**

Finance cost for 2021 increased by $4.9 million, or 1.8%, to $279.0 million, compared to $274.1 million in

2020. This was primarily driven by one-time expenses to prepay certain term loans, partially offset by a decrease in
interest expense following the sale of our Precor business.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Income tax expense for 2021 increased by $8.5 million, or 32.4%, to $34.7 million, compared to $26.2 million

in 2020. Our effective income tax rate was 39% for 2021, compared to 18% in 2020. The increase in the effective
income tax rate was primarily due to an increase in our taxable income as a result of the growth of our business.

**_Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax_**

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2021 decreased by $61.8 million, or 97.2%, to $1.8 million,

compared to $63.6 million in 2020. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2020 comprised (i) losses
generated by Suunto for the entire year, including an impairment loss on non-financial assets of $20.8 million on
Suunto, and (ii) losses for Precor for the entire year. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2021 included
losses generated by Suunto for the entire year, including an impairment loss on non-financial assets of $77.5 million
upon classifying Suunto as held-for-sale, and losses generated by Precor for the period until disposal on April 1,
2021, partially offset by a gain upon disposal of Precor in the amount of $116.0 million.

**Segment Results of Operations**

Our management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on segment

revenue and Segment Adjusted Operating Profit. Costs allocated to the segments include certain centralized
functions provided and administered by the Amer Sports group, such as costs related to sourcing, warehousing,
distribution and transportation, our global business services center and information technology, based on appropriate
metrics such as headcount, activity, usage or proportion of revenue.

Unallocated costs include costs related to supply chain management, general executive management,

cybersecurity and other group functions such as finance, internal audit, tax, legal and human resources.

The following tables set forth certain financial information for our reportable segments for the periods

presented.

Total segment revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $383.9 million, or 58.3%, to

$1,042.7 million, compared to $658.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily
driven by sales growth of $264.0 million in our DTC channel, or 67.2% through continued momentum in our retail
stores and e-commerce business. We expanded our retail store network with a net increase of 12 owned retail stores,
while strong consumer demand drove increased store productivity. Segment revenue from e-commerce increased
from $136.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $228.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 due to higher traffic to our owned e-commerce websites. By geography, segment revenue in the
DTC channel in the Americas grew by 79.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2022, and in Greater China by 72.7% for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with China experiencing a strong rebound from
COVID-19 restrictions in 2022.

Revenues from our wholesale channel increased $120.0 million, or 45.1% due to an increase in wholesale

shipments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2022. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by
$430.6 million, or 65.4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $114.8 million,

or 161.0%, to $186.0 million, compared to $71.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was
primarily driven by gross margin improvement related to favorable channel and geographic mix, with increased
sales through the DTC channel, partially offset by increased operating expenses to support our retail store and ecommerce expansion, as well as investments in personnel, marketing and infrastructure.

$1,144.4 million, compared to $902.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily
driven by improvements in supply chain capacity for footwear, which drove revenue growth in the wholesale
channel, as well as continued momentum in consumer demand in the DTC channel. The growth in the DTC channel
was primarily driven by retail store network expansion in Greater China, as well as increased traffic to our owned ecommerce websites. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
increased by $241.0 million, or 26.7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased by $56.3 million,

to $103.2 million, compared to $46.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily
driven by the increase in revenue and gross margin improvement from shifting channel and product mix, as well as
lower logistics costs, partially offset by increased operating expenses.

$866.3 million, compared to $788.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The growth was
primarily driven by sales of basketball, baseball and tennis products and offset by sales decline in golf products. The
growth in basketball products sales was driven by increased volume in the premium game ball category as we
continue to leverage our partnership with the NBA, and the growth in baseball products sales was due to stronger
product launches as compared to prior periods. Higher inventory levels of golf products in the market also
contributed to a decrease in revenue in this product category. The growth in total segment revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily focused in the Americas, as revenue increased by $56.7 million or
10.4% from $547.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $603.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 increased by $81.7 million, or 10.4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $8.5 million,

or 13.3%, to $55.6 million, compared to $64.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This was
primarily due to the increase in operating expenses more than offsetting the improvement in gross margin.

Total segment revenue for 2022 increased by $144.8 million, or 15.2%, to $1,095.5 million, compared to $950.7

million in 2021. This was primarily driven by an increase in sales through the DTC channel. Segment revenue from
e-commerce increased from $205.8 million in 2021 to $263.8 million in 2022 due to higher traffic to our owned ecommerce websites. The growth in sales through the DTC channel was further driven by a net increase of 5 owned

compared to 2021, and in Greater China by 34.4% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The growth in DTC was partially
offset by a modest decline in segment revenue from our wholesale channel as our channel mix evolved due to our
DTC channel strategy. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for 2022 increased by $210.1 million, or
22.1%, compared to 2021.

Total segment revenue for 2021 increased by $265.3 million, or 38.7%, to $950.7 million, compared to $685.4

million in 2020. This was primarily driven by an increase in sales as a result of our DTC channel strategy and
resulting shift in channel mix and the easing of COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. Segment revenue from ecommerce increased from $131.5 million in 2020 to $205.8 million in 2021 due to higher traffic to our owned ecommerce websites. The growth in sales through the DTC channel was further driven by a net increase of 14 owned

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2021 increased by $47.0 million, or 40.1%, to $164.2 million, compared

Total segment revenue for 2022 increased by $180.8 million, or 14.6%, to $1,416.5 million, compared to

$1,235.7 million in 2021. This was primarily driven by increased sales across all geographic regions, largely through
the wholesale channel. Segment revenue attributable to sales of footwear increased due to strong consumer demand
and improvements in supply chain capacity, as footwear and apparel manufacturers in Vietnam recovered from
COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in 2021, while an increase in segment revenue attributable to ski
equipment was driven by continued high consumer demand in North America, together with a rebound following the
previous winter’s travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in EMEA. Segment revenue on a constant
currency basis for 2022 increased by $303.8 million, or 24.6%, compared to 2021.

Total segment revenue for 2021 increased by $144.1 million, or 13.2%, to $1,235.7 million, compared to

$1,091.6 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our footwear and apparel
products, which was partially offset by supply chain constraints, including the shutdown of footwear and apparel
vendors in Vietnam as well as sea freight container shortages, resulting in shipments arriving later than expected.
Ski equipment grew only moderately due in part to the impact of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19
pandemic, particularly in EMEA, during the winter of 2020 and 2021. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis
for 2021 increased by $115.9 million, or 10.6%, compared to 2020.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2022 increased by $25.9 million, or 28.2%, to $117.6 million, compared

to $91.7 million in 2021. This was primarily driven by gross margin improvement from pricing actions despite
higher product, energy and sea freight costs, partially offset by increased operating expenses.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2021 increased by $9.9 million, or 12.1%, to $91.7 million, compared to

$81.8 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by gross margin improvement due in part to fewer instances of
inventory obsolescence, and partially offset by higher operating expenses related to increases in marketing and R&D
spend used support our growth strategy, as well as personnel costs following the end of many COVID-19 pandemic
cost-saving initiatives.

Total segment revenue for 2022 increased by $156.6 million, or 17.8%, to $1,036.7 million, compared to $880.1

million in 2021. The growth was primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our basketball, baseball, and
performance tennis products, driven in part by new product introduction, an increased volume of sales generated
from our first full year as the exclusive basketball provider and licensee of the NBA, and increased demand in
baseball following the easing of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The growth in total segment revenue for 2022
was primarily focused in the Americas, as revenue increased by $132.7 million or 22.3% from $596.3 million in
2021 to $729.0 million in 2022. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for 2022 increased by $190.7 million,

-----

Total segment revenue for 2021 increased by $210.8 million, or 31.5%, to $880.1 million as compared to

$669.3 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by strong consumer demand across all product categories, led by
tennis and baseball, as consumer participation in team and individual sports rebounded following the easing of
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, as well as an increased volume of sales generated as the exclusive basketball
provider and licensee of the NBA as of July 1, 2021. The growth in total segment revenue for 2021 was primarily
focused in the Americas, as revenues increased from $458.3 million in 2020 to $596.3 million in 2021, a growth of
$138.0 million or 30.1%. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for 2021 increased by $195.4 million, or
29.2%, compared to 2020.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2022 increased by $3.7 million, or 6.5%, to $60.9 million, compared to

$57.2 million in 2021. This was primarily driven by increased sales volume, gross margin improvement from pricing
actions and product mix, despite higher product and sea freight costs, partially offset by an increase in operating
expenses, driven by the launch of Wilson’s sportswear line and higher IT, digital marketing and R&D expenses.

Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2021 increased by $25.5 million, or 80.4%, to $57.2 million, compared

to $31.7 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by increased sales volume, gross margin improvement from
pricing actions and the shift in channel mix from increased sales through the DTC channel. This growth was
partially offset by an increase in marketing and R&D spend to support our growth strategy and personnel costs
following the end of many COVID-19 pandemic cost-saving initiatives.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

Management uses certain non-IFRS financial measures to supplement the financial measures prepared in

accordance with IFRS, which include constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA Margin. We use constant currency revenue information to provide a framework to assess how our business
segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial
and operating performance from period to period, because they exclude certain material items relating to income tax
expense, finance cost and depreciation and amortization which are not reflective of our ongoing operations and
performance. In addition, management believes constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin are measures commonly used by investors to evaluate companies in the apparel,
footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories industries.

However, there are limitations to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures as analytical tools and they

should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in
accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies.
Constant currency revenue is limited as a metric to review the Company’s financial results as it does not reflect
impacts of foreign currency on revenue. Some of the limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA Margin include: excluding certain tax payments that may reduce cash available to us; not reflecting any
cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in
the future; not reflecting changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and not reflecting the
interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt.

The tables below reconcile each of the following non-IFRS financial measures to their respective most directly

comparable IFRS measure for the periods presented.

ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(2) Total interest expense on lease liabilities under IFRS 16 was $7.4 million and $6.5 million for the nine months

ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total interest expense on lease liabilities under IFRS 16 was
$8.5 million, $9.1 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Includes finance cost from discontinued operations of nil and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0.5 million, $(0.3) million and $(1.4) million for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(3) Total amortization expense for right-of-use assets capitalized under IFRS 16 was $59.4 million and $56.0

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total amortization expense for
right-of-use assets capitalized under IFRS 16 was $73.3 million, $74.1 million and $69.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Includes depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of nil and $4.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $2.7 million, $10.4 million and $50.2 million for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(4) There was no finance income from discontinued operations for the periods presented.

(5) Loss from discontinued operations before income tax expense, finance cost, depreciation and amortization and

finance income.

(6) Includes expenses for restructuring from exit and termination events.

(7) Includes impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets.

(8) Includes advisory fees in connection with M&A activities and the Amer Sports IPO as well as certain one-time

costs recognized in 2020 in relation to the Acquisition.

(9) Includes expenses related to a certain patent infringement litigation. While we face such litigation from time to

time, the magnitude of costs is rarely significant and this litigation expense is substantially higher than all but
one other patent litigation expense in the last 10 years. Accordingly, we view expenses related to this litigation
as outside our normal course of operations and not representative of our expected and recurring expenses. Legal
expenses for other normal, recurring legal proceedings and other legal matters are not included in this
adjustment.

(10) We granted share-based compensation to employees under our equity compensation plans during the nine

months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, but did
not incur any expenses related to share-based payments in such periods as options granted under our equity
compensation plans only vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the


-----

occurrence of an exit event, such as an initial public offering, and we did not believe an exit event was probable
during such time. We expect to recognize expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of
the year ended December 31, 2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based
payments in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe that such
expenses are not representative of our ongoing expenses as they relate to recognition in a single period of
incentive compensation granted over a period of several fiscal years.

**Quarterly Results of Operations**

The following table sets forth selected unaudited consolidated quarterly income and loss data and selected

quarterly non-IFRS financial measures for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2022 and each of the

of operations and not representative of our expected and recurring expenses. Legal expenses for other normal, recurring
legal proceedings and other legal matters are not included in this adjustment.

(10) We granted share-based compensation to employees under our equity compensation plans during each of the periods

presented but did not incur any expenses related to share-based payments in for such periods as options granted under our
equity compensation plans only vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the
occurrence of an exit event, such as an initial public offering, and we did not believe an exit event was probable during such
time. We expect to recognize expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of the year ended
December 31, 2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based payments in our calculation of
Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that such expenses are not representative of our ongoing expenses as they relate to
recognition in a single period of incentive compensation granted over a period of several fiscal years.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, lease

obligations and for general corporate purposes. Typically, the highest level of working capital has been reached in
the third quarter when inventory and accounts receivable are at a peak during the fall and winter shopping season.

Our future contractual obligations are further discussed in “—Contractual Obligations and Commitments”

below. Historically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, shareholder loans
and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. We had $402.0 million, $566.7 million and $389.5 million of
cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively. The


-----

$164.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021
was primarily due to inventory build-up following the supply chain disruptions experienced during 2021. The
$177.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 as compared to January 1, 2021 was
primarily due to the divestiture of the Precor business and the reduction of inventory related to supply chain
disruptions. As of September 30, 2023, we had $284.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. The $117.8 million
decrease as of September 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to use of cash in operating and
investing activities.

We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow from operations and credit facilities will

be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our longterm capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors,
including the rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts, new
owned retail store openings and other growth initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing
of new products, and overall economic conditions. We are also expecting increased capital expenditures related to
the upgrade of our global SAP enterprise resource planning system over the next several years, which we are in the
process of implementing across each of our brands, and the expansion of our warehousing facilities. Our capital
expenditure budget for 2023 is approximately $200 million and we expect our capital expenditure budget for 2024 to
be approximately $300 million.

As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, we would

have had $1.991 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, which consists of $50 million
under the Bilateral Facility (as defined in “Description of Other Indebtedness”), $600 million principal amount of
notes offered hereby, $600 million incurred under the New USD Term Loan Facility and EUR 600 million incurred
under the New EUR Term Loan Facility, $339 million of borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility,
$1.941 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness, and approximately $604 million would have been
available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Summary—Recent Developments—
Concurrent Refinancing Transactions” and “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities.

To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business

activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional
equity would result in additional dilution to shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt
service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants
that may restrict our operations. We also regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various
financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. If market conditions are favorable, we may
refinance our existing debt or issue additional securities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise
additional capital on terms that are attractive to us or at all. The inability to raise capital may adversely affect our
ability to achieve our business objectives.

_Operating Activities_

Cash outflow from operating activities was $106.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,

compared to cash outflow from operating activities of $179.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022. The year-over-year improvement of $73.6 million was primarily due to improved operating profit, partially
offset by an increase in inventory and higher interest payments.

Cash outflow from operating activities was $91.7 million in 2022 compared to cash inflow from operating

activities of $268.0 million in 2021. The year-over-year decrease of $359.7 million in cash inflows from operating
activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory following supply chain recovery following the COVID-19
pandemic, partially offset by sales growth.

Cash inflow from operating activities was $268.0 million in 2021 compared to cash inflow from operating

activities of $297.9 million in 2020. The year-over-year decrease of $29.9 million in cash inflows from operating
activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory, partially offset by improved earnings from sales growth and
gross margin expansion.

_Investing Activities_

Cash outflow from investing activities was $95.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,

compared to cash outflow from investing activities of $82.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
The year-over-year increase of $13.2 million in cash outflow from investing activities was due to a moderate
increase in capital expenditures.

Cash outflow from investing activities was $118.6 million in 2022 compared to cash inflow from investing

activities of $295.4 million in 2021. The year-over-year decrease of $414.0 million in cash flows from investing
activities was due to the sale of Precor in 2021 and a moderate increase in capital expenditure.

Cash inflow from investing activities was $295.4 million in 2021 compared to cash outflow from investing

activities of $106.7 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase of $402.1 million in cash flows from investing
activities was primarily due to the sale of Precor and moderate reduction in capital expenditure.

Our capital expenditures (which we define herein to refer to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment

and the acquisition of intangible assets, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 totaled $90.0 million and $74.7 million respectively and for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $109.8 million, $93.7 million and $106.0 million, respectively.

_Financing Activities_

Cash inflow from financing activities was $97.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,

compared to cash inflow from financing activities of $47.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
The year-over-year increase of $49.5 million in cash flows from financing activities was due to the draw down of
short-term credit facilities to fund working capital.

Cash inflow from financing activities was $81.1 million in 2022 compared to cash outflow from financing

activities of $369.7 million in 2021. The year-over-year increase of $450.8 million in cash flows from financing
activities was due to draw down of short term credit facilities to fund working capital.

Cash outflow from financing activities was $369.7 million in 2021 compared to cash outflow from financing

activities of $165.3 million in 2020. The year-over-year decrease of $204.4 million in cash flows from financing
activities was primarily due to repayment of loan facilities following the sale of Precor.

**Contractual Obligations and Commitments**

(1) Loans from related parties relate to shareholder loans that were repaid in part with proceeds from the Amer

Sports IPO.

(2) Other commitments primarily consist of lease contracts for short-term leased assets and for low value assets,

commitments related to long-term endorsement contracts with professional and non-professional sports leagues,
as well as certain short-term contracts, contracts with brand ambassadors and certain guarantees related to the
divested Precor business. Such guarantees, in accordance with the share purchase agreement related to such
sale, are the buyer’s responsibility commencing from the date of purchase and are expected to be released in
2024.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with certain leases and guarantees. Leases not

capitalized mainly relate to short term and low value leases for which IFRS 16 offers an exemption from
capitalization, while the guarantees include arrangements with third parties related to the divested Precor business.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss

that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Foreign currency risk primarily relates to the extent that sales, purchases, and borrowings of our foreign

operations are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the
transaction is recorded by us. Assets and liabilities arising from such transactions are translated into the legal
entity’s functional currency using the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are
translated using the average exchange rate over the relevant period. Our functional currency is the euro. We present
our financial statements in U.S. dollars, and record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate in effect on the
transaction date, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are outstanding at the end of a
financial period are translated at the closing rate in effect on the applicable balance sheet date.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we generated 64.9%, 66.6% and 66.6%

of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars and 74.1%, 77.3% and 78.0% of our operating expenses were
incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, we generated 66.8% and 62.7% of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars and 84.0% and
83.0% of our operating expenses were incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In periods where the U.S.
dollar strengthens relative to the euro, Canadian dollar, RMB or other foreign currencies in countries where we have
operations, there is a negative impact on our operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into
the U.S. dollar. The translation impact of a 10% increase in the U.S. dollar against all other foreign currencies would
have increased operating profit by $10.1 million, decreased operating profit by $3.9 million and decreased operating
profit by $3.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential change
noted above is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2022.

Transaction risk arises from foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. 29.5%, 35.7% and 36.4% of

our assets and 75.8%, 80.2% and 80.8% of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency exposure as of December
31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 29.5% and 29.1% of our assets and 76.7% and


-----

75.6% of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency exposure as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The net impact after hedging based on a strengthening of the U.S. dollar by 10% vs. our five main currencies would
have resulted in an increase in net loss of $20 million, $21 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential change noted above is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on
our financial position as of December 31, 2022.

Where possible, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure through a variety of methods, including by

financing each business unit in its functional currency and concentrating cash flows through centralized entities to
limit the number of foreign currencies being utilized for purchases. Additionally, we enter into hedging
arrangements to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for a significant portion of our cash flows, in
particular with our most commonly used foreign currencies, including euros, Canadian dollars and RMB. Such
hedging arrangements may include foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swaps, interest rate
options and cross-currency swaps. The majority of our hedging arrangements are short-term and are usually rolled
forward within the standard business cycle. Nonetheless, it is not practical for us to mitigate all of our foreign
currency exposure, nor are we able to accurately predict the possible impact of future foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on our results of operations, due to our constantly changing exposure to various foreign currencies,
difficulty in predicting fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the significant
number of foreign currencies involved. We have experienced and we will continue to experience fluctuations in our
net income as a result of revaluing our assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of
the entity that recorded the asset or liability.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

We are exposed to commodity and other price risk, including from rubber, nylon, polyester and steel, aluminum

and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric, as well as other inputs,
including energy, transportation and logistics services. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management
negotiates prices in advance when possible. We have not historically managed commodity price exposures by using
derivative instruments.

**_Inflation Risk_**

Inflationary pressures have recently increased, and may continue to increase, the costs of labor, raw materials

and other inputs for our products. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, higher than expected
inflation, including escalating transportation, commodity and other supply chain costs and disruptions. If our costs
are subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such higher costs through price
increases, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Funding and Liquidity Risk_**

Our ability to obtain additional capital, if and when required, will depend on our business plans, investor

demand, our operating performance, market conditions, our credit rating and other factors, and we may not be able
to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner
and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, as well as on our ability to
timely repay existing commitments.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our interest expense for our existing borrowings and for any new debt we may incur in the future could be

exposed to changes in interest rates. We engage in hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to interest rate
fluctuations. Even though we engage in hedging activities, interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors,
including monetary and tax policies, market and economic factors and other factors beyond our control, as well as
due to repricing of existing floating rate debt and raising new floating rate debt, and could have a significant
negative or positive impact on the results of our operations. As of December 31, 2022, a 1% increase in interest rates
would have increased net loss by $52.5 million, $48.5 million and $49.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential change noted above is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on
our financial position as of December 31, 2022.


-----

**_Credit Risk_**

We are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our receivables,

including our customers. Concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the
diversity of our customers and the global nature of our business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our largest
single customer accounted for 4% of total accounts receivable and our 20 largest wholesale partners accounted for
31% of total accounts receivable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our largest single customer
accounted for 2.9% of total accounts receivable and our 20 largest wholesale partners accounted for 27.4% of total
accounts receivable. At December 31, 2022, the average payment time for outstanding sales was 53 days. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, the average payment time for outstanding sales was 50 days. In order to
minimize risk, we perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions, use credit insurances in the
majority of the countries in Europe as well as in Japan, and may also obtain collateral or other security as
appropriate. Notwithstanding these efforts, current adverse macroeconomic factors across the global economy may
increase the difficulty in collecting receivables.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated

financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with IFRS. The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the
reported amounts and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the
accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and, therefore, we
consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Accordingly, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

See Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and Note 2,

“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, each
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for information about these critical accounting policies, as well as
a description of our other significant accounting policies.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is primarily derived from the sale of merchandise through our DTC channel, which comprises owned

retail and e-commerce, and our wholesale channel, but also includes limited services and license fees. Revenue is
presented net of value added tax, discounts, incentives, rebates earned by customers and estimated returns. We
recognize revenue under IFRS 15 at the point in time when control of the products and services are transferred to the
customer in accordance with the terms of delivery at an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to
be entitled in exchange for those products and services in the ordinary course of our activities. We apply the
following five-step model when determining the timing and amount of revenue recognition:

(1) identifying the contracts with customers;

(2) identifying the separate performance obligations;

(3) determining the transaction price;

(4) allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and

(5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.

Contracts with customers generally consist of a single performance obligation, including merchandise,

packaging and delivery activities. Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control over the goods and the
required services have been performed. We recognize a contract liability for products for which control has not been
transferred to the customer.

We generally offer DTC customers of our products the right to return or exchange merchandise purchased

within 14-30 days of receipt, while certain of our contracts provide wholesale partners a right to return goods within
a specified period. A refund liability is recognized as a reduction of sales and a right of return asset is recognized as
a reduction of cost of goods sold, based on both historical experience and anticipated future returns.


-----

In the wholesale sector, we offer certain major wholesale partners volume rebates, performance bonuses, and

payment term discounts. We primarily utilize the expected value method to estimate the variable consideration for
future rebates and performance bonuses.

We recognize a contract liability for the sale of gift cards in both owned retail and e-commerce. We anticipate

to be entitled to a breakage amount, which is then recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of customer
rights exercised based on historical data.

**_Inventory_**

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, utilizing the weighted average cost method,

which requires an estimate of the products future selling prices. When determining the net realizable value, we
consider several factors, including seasonal fluctuations in selling prices, estimated expenses for completing the sale,
inventory levels, aging, customer behavior, anticipated sales volume, and expected selling prices and costs. When
circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down below cost no longer exist, the amount of the
write-down previously recorded is reversed.

**_Impairment of Non-Financial Assets_**

We assess the carrying amounts of our non-financial assets, such as our goodwill and intangible assets with

indefinite useful lives, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment at each reporting date. If any such
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested at least annually for
impairment.

Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset or the cash generating unit

(“CGU”), which is the smallest group of assets generating cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from
other assets or groups of assets, to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of
its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is calculated using the discounted cash flow
method for each CGU. We assessed the carrying value of our non-financial assets for potential impairment during
the fourth quarter of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.

Impairment is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Recognized

impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then
to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

Key assumptions we use for impairment assessment include forecasted cash flows of the business, estimated

discount rate, royalty rates and future growth rates. We use internal and external data to forecast the key
assumptions. The cash flow projections are based on a 10-year financial forecast, of which the first five years are
prepared by management and approved by our board of directors. To better reflect the medium-term growth
expectations for the CGU in growing markets, financial forecasts after the first five-year period are extrapolated for
a further five years using declining growth rates, which reduce the year-five growth rate to the long-term growth
rate.

We recognized impairment losses of $198.1 million for Peak Performance in 2022. In 2020 and 2021, no

impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were recorded in the continuing
operations.

**_Share-based Payments_**

On November 27, 2019 and January 20, 2023, our board of directors established the 2019 ESOP and 2023

ESOP, respectively. The objectives of the 2019 ESOP and the 2023 ESOP are to align the interest of the
shareholders and key employees in order to increase our value in the long-term, and to commit key employees to us.
The 2019 ESOP and the 2023 ESOP provide for awards in the form of stock options to our key employees. The
maximum number of options that may be granted under the 2019 ESOP and the 2023 ESOP is 3% and 1.2%,
respectively, of all of our issued and outstanding shares.

Options granted to employees vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the

occurrence of an exit event. An exit event refers to a public offering of the Company’s shares or a sale of the
controlling majority shares or business assets and is considered a non-market performance condition. When options


-----

have service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the
number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures.

This estimation is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is based on our

best estimate of expected forfeitures, taking into consideration historical trends and expected future behavior
regarding forfeitures.

For options that depend on non-market performance conditions (i.e., an exit event), we recognize the related

expense if and when we conclude that it is probable that the exit event will be achieved. No options were exercised,
nor were any share-based payment expenses for equity-settled awards and cash-settled awards recognized, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020, in the
latter case because the likelihood of occurrence of such condition was not deemed probable during any reporting
period. We reassess the probability of achieving the non-market performance condition at each reporting date to
ensure the accuracy of this assessment.

The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model

including any market performance conditions and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance
vesting conditions. Equity-settled awards are measured on the grant date, while cash- settled awards are remeasured
until settlement. See Note 10, “Share-Based Payments,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and Note 6,
“Share-Based Payments,” to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

Expected volatility has been based on the historical volatility of the comparable companies’ share price,

particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected life of the options. The expected life of the
instrument generally refers to the vesting date plus one year, which is based on general option holder behavior.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

New accounting guidance that we have recently adopted, as well as accounting guidance that has been recently

issued but not yet adopted by us, is included in Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited
consolidated financial statements and Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our unaudited
interim financial statements, each included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we identified a material weakness

in our internal control over financial reporting. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Financial, Accounting and Tax
Matters—We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to
remediate the material weakness or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to
develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely
report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business.” We are in the
process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate
the material weakness. This includes implementing new information technology and systems for the preparation of
financial statements, implementing additional review procedures within our accounting and finance department, and
hiring additional staff and engaging external accounting experts to support improving our accounting processes and
procedures and supplement our internal resources in our computation processes.

segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports. Our segments comprise our “brand
clusters,” which reflect both how our consumers engage with our products and how we manage our business.


-----

Each segment is led by one of our core brands: Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson. Each of these brands creates

high-quality technical products that stand out in their respective categories, and possesses key differentiated
attributes.

**_Arc’teryx_**

-----

pioneered the implementation on its jackets of a traditional zipper in reverse, which allows for smoother and more
water resistant seams. The products provide durability to withstand the rigors of any outdoor adventures,
exemplified by the professionals that choose to use them, including the Austrian Mountain Rescue, comprising over
13,000 professionals and members who depend on the gear for protection in extreme conditions. Product quality,
from the materials to the design, allows Arc’teryx to command premium pricing as evidenced by its best-selling
“hardshell” jacket in North America, the Alpha SV. Overall, Arc’teryx combines beautiful, innovative products and
an authentic brand experience that extends beyond apparel, fostering communities and bringing people together
across all regions of the world who share a passion for the outdoors.

Born in the French Alps in 1947, Salomon creates premium innovative footwear, apparel, winter sports

equipment and accessories. Since its founding, Salomon has been fueled by a culture of design, craftsmanship,
continuous innovation, and performance inspired by progress, the outdoors and athletes. The brand first produced
metal ski edges and expanded into releasable ski bindings before launching industry changing rear-entry ski boots
and monocoque skis. The brand’s leadership in winter sports helped to propel it into a diverse portfolio of sports and
products including footwear and apparel. Today, Salomon is a market leader in global trail running footwear and
premium hiking footwear, with products recognized for their performance, style, durability and sustainability. Over
60% of Salomon’s revenue for 2022 came from footwear, while also having leading market positions in its legacy
winter sports equipment categories (skis, snowboards, boots, bindings, goggles, helmets, etc.), creating a 365-day,
year-round brand serving all seasons for mountain sport consumers.

Slam Tennis Championships, as well as the NCAA, making Wilson products integral to performance in sport. These
athletes and leagues are a testament to the credibility and reputation of Wilson’s track record of innovation and
superior products.

**Wilson: A Rich Heritage Redefining Sport & Performance**

**Play What the Pros Play**


-----

While Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson stand tall and lead our three segments, our other brands appropriately fit

our sports-oriented portfolio. Brands such as Atomic and Peak Performance enhance our scale, competitive
positioning and diversification across sports categories. Together, our brands enable us to lead and compete in
various sports segments and drive the continued success of our portfolio. For example, Atomic is a category leader
in ski equipment. Together, Atomic and Salomon give us a strong position in the ski equipment market. Peak
Performance is an apparel and accessories brand with a passion for adventure and nature that fuels its technical
design features. These additional brands add to the prowess of our portfolio and we believe have significant
opportunity to grow leveraging the benefits of our platform.

**_The Amer Sports Group_**

We excel at identifying, developing and defining brands that meet our corporate vision. We empower these

brands to autonomously connect with consumers and develop products to drive growth. Our platform supports the
brands via scaled infrastructure and financial controls to accelerate performance. Our operations are subject to
complexity and risk consistent with being a large global organization. We believe that the size and diversification of
our platform mitigates risks and provides financial flexibility to invest prudently to meet the continuously evolving
needs of consumers, to develop competitive advantages and to drive growth across the brands through a relentless
focus on innovation. We also believe that our platform enables efficient integration, scaling and optimization of
target opportunities that fit within our portfolio, as well as critical insight to inform divestiture decisions.

We govern our brands through management across the finance, supply chain, sustainability, communication,

legal and compliance functions, among other areas. At the same time, we enable our brands through our group’s
incubator model that provides shared learnings from data analytics across the platform as well as from the
economies of scale and synergies of shared resources, including supplier services, distribution and logistics, human
resources and enterprise IT infrastructure. We further serve our brands through access to shared, centralized business
services, including customer service and treasury management functions. All together, these resources empower our
brand leadership teams to focus on serving consumers through brand, product and go-to-market strategies that drive
performance, and our global and scaled operating model enables larger, robust brand organizations to independently
flourish.

Four values guide our behaviors and help us play by the same rules across the platform and around the world:

  - **Always Authentic: We stay true to who we are and build trusting relationships with integrity.**

  - **Better Together: We take our diverse expertise to new heights and team up to grow stronger.**

  - **Committed to Impact: We play the long game, guided by respect for people and our planet.**

  - **Driven to Excellence: We play fair, aim for excellence and celebrate our wins.**

**_Deeply Committed to Sustainability_**

As a global group of sports and outdoor brands, we believe we can foster more sustainable lifestyles, encourage

mindful consumption, and promote well-being. While the sports and outdoor industry connects us with nature, we
also understand it can consume our planet’s precious resources. Together with our brands, we are focused on
managing the complex and challenging supply chains in our industry to build a sustainability culture that positively
impacts our environment and the people whose lives we touch. As a participant of the UN Global Compact, Amer
Sports Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, aims to incorporate the Ten Principles of the Global Compact and
to support applicable UN Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, we have committed to set science-based
near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets at the group level, which we intend to submit to be validated by
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

At the brand level, we are focused on sustainable business practices. For example, Arc’teryx opened five new

ReBird™ Service Centers in the United States, Canada, Greater China and Japan. ReBird™ Service Centers offer
consumers complementary repair services for their Arc’teryx gear, connecting consumers to the brand’s ongoing
focus on improving circularity, including upcycling, resale, care and repair. Arc’teryx’s sustainability program,
ReCare™, provides consumers with information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™
program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program
accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform. Salomon and Peak Performance have


-----

reduced the need for materials and transport by using 3D product samples for sales purposes and are looking to
expand the use of 3D in consumer experiences and e-commerce. Further, Arc’teryx and Salomon have each set
brand-level near-term science-based emission reduction targets for 2030 approved by the SBTi.

Our management oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy. Cross-functional operational teams

drive our efforts on sustainable business practices, led by the Amer Sports platform with participation across key
brands and functions. Working groups plan and execute roadmaps on sustainability initiatives in key areas
identified, such as climate change, circular economy, responsible procurement and supply chain, human rights, and
diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also take our responsibility for the health and well-being of our own employees
as well as the employees of our partners along the value chain seriously. Our membership in the Fair Labor
Association highlights our commitment to working to uphold human rights in our global supply chain with
initiatives to protect workers’ rights globally and drive long-term improvements through training and education,
worker engagement, and integration into sourcing practices.

**Our Transformation**

In 2019, an international investment consortium consisting of ANTA Sports, FountainVest, Anamered

Investments (an entity affiliated with Chip Wilson) and Tencent acquired Amer Sports (the “Acquisition”) with the
goal of unlocking substantial underlying brand growth potential by transforming the business model, investing in the
brands, expanding geographies and developing a multi-channel strategy. Following the Acquisition, our revenue
growth has accelerated, with a CAGR of 20.4% from 2020 to 2022, while gross margins have expanded from 47.0%
to 49.7% over the same time period. Concurrently, through a reinvented operating model and go-to-market strategy,
we are experiencing an elevated connection with our target consumers.

**_Brand-direct Operating Model Delivering a Tailored Consumer Experience_**

Prior to the Acquisition, Amer Sports operated with a matrix organizational structure where key strategic

decisions were made through a complex, consensus-forming process and executed across the portfolio and products,
which we believe limited the brands’ growth potential. In 2019, we reorganized and simplified our corporate
structure to reflect a brand-direct model within our three core segments designed to empower our brands and drive
accountability. Under this new structure, the leadership team of each brand is responsible for developing its own
brand strategy and executing it end-to-end throughout the value chain. Our segments, Technical Apparel, Outdoor
Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports, each focus on specific areas of strength within the group. Each segment is
in turn led by one of our top three brands. This segment focused brand-direct model provides each brand with
significant autonomy over decisions across key approved functional areas including product innovation, design and
development, marketing and sourcing as well as channel and geographic strategies.

At the same time, we have sharpened our strategic focus on the most attractive subsectors in outdoor and sports,

driving our multi-channel strategy and the dominance of our core brands in large markets. We mobilize global
resources of the Amer Sports platform to support our brands to create a differentiated and powerful growth engine.
Since our transition to our new group structure and operating model, our brands have demonstrated strong
momentum and accelerated growth.

**_Elevated Brand Positioning_**

In 2019, we conducted consumer insight studies to enhance our brands’ understanding of their target consumer

demographics across key geographies. We expect our target consumers to be highly focused on technical
performance and premium quality, and to aspire to own and utilize the best products regardless of whether engaging
in sporting activities or navigating everyday routines. We continue to advance our products to meet our consumers’
needs, while enhancing our marketing strategies to clarify the premium brand positioning and drive a deeper
emotional connection with consumers. We leverage creative product marketing, rich digital content, brand
ambassadors and community building activities centered around the brands to create an authentic connection with
the consumer that has resulted in stronger brand advocacy and loyalty. As our brands continue to grow, we will need
to balance the risk of brand dilution with greater brand awareness, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance
our brands, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, harm to our reputation
could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain consumers and wholesale partners, employees, brand
ambassadors, partners and other stakeholders.


-----

Our brand-direct model provides the brands with creative freedom to communicate their vision in a cohesive

manner across categories and geographies. A consumer in the United States or China can feel a similar connection to
the Canadian Coast Mountains inspired Arc’teryx jacket or the detailed craftsmanship devoted to every pair of
French-designed Salomon shoes. To match our reimagined brand messaging around premiumization, we narrowed
our product portfolio across many brands to reposition our focus on premium items and reduce the number of entrylevel products with lower price points. We believe elevating our brand positioning with differentiated premium
products has led to strong consumer demand globally and rapid growth.

**_Strategic Transformation of the Go-to-Market Strategy_**

Through our brand-direct model, we have developed a better understanding of each brand’s target consumers,

which has allowed us to elevate brand positioning and customize each brand’s go-to-market strategies to develop
deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers. These tailored go-to- market strategies are designed to
effectively reach target consumers and drive traffic and conversion. For example, Arc’teryx is aligned with a DTC
channel strategy because of its technical apparel product portfolio where it can leverage a retail store base to deliver
an immersive experience to consumers.

Salomon is historically a wholesale driven business due to its legacy in winter sport equipment and relationship

with specialty retailers for its footwear. However, with expanded consumer appeal and product portfolio breadth,
Salomon has seen strong success in DTC in EMEA and Greater China. Wilson is predominantly focused on sports
equipment through the wholesale channel, but its growing sportswear business is effectively utilizing owned retail,
e-commerce and digital marketing to connect with younger consumers. In addition, since the Acquisition, both
Salomon and Wilson have transformed their wholesale partnership networks with the aim to focus on high-quality
partners who attract each brand’s target consumers.

We believe our brands and products are highly valuable to our wholesale partners, which provides us broad

distribution for a core product set. At the same time, we have a dedicated product portfolio that is geared towards
our DTC customers. Our focus on connecting with consumers through the DTC channel provides us with datadriven insights across the portfolio, and we leverage that information to drive continuous improvement in our
product development, marketing strategies and overall consumer experience. Across our three core brands, our
global owned retail network includes 138 Arc’teryx owned retail stores, 114 Salomon owned retail stores and nine
Wilson owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023.

**_Accelerated Brand Penetration in Greater China_**

We have leveraged key learnings from our long-term oriented owners to enhance our capabilities and

performance in Greater China. As a result, we have grown our Greater China business significantly at a time when
others were facing challenges or retrenching. We now have a deep understanding of the average consumer in
Greater China and are able to deliver authentic, technical and premium products that align with consumer
preferences. Our retail knowhow, including our ability to deliver a high-end, luxury oriented in-store presentation
and execution capabilities have been upgraded significantly, allowing us to quickly identify and secure highly
attractive store locations with desirable consumer foot traffic. For example, we have 63 Arc’teryx owned retail
stores in Greater China as of September 30, 2023. The stores combined with our brand connects well with both pure
outdoor adventurers and luxury consumers in Greater China. We also have 30 Salomon owned retail stores and a
total of 67 Salomon distribution points (including owned retail stores and partner stores) in Greater China as of
September 30, 2023, up from 13 in 2019. For Wilson, we recently became the exclusive NBA provider and licensee
of basketballs, which is driving growth in the region, and the rapid adoption of winter sports in Greater China is
driving Salomon and Atomic winter equipment sales.

Our execution in Greater China has successfully increased our percentage of total revenue derived from the

region from 8.3% in 2020 to 14.8%, or $523.8 million, in 2022, and up to 19.4% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and we believe there is significant runway for growth in the region as we continue to roll-out
retail locations across our brands and scale our e-commerce platform.

**_Assembled a Talented and Innovative Leadership Team to Execute the Transformation and Growth Strategy_**

In 2020, we appointed Jie (James) Zheng as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Zheng also served as President of

ANTA Sports until 2023 and, prior to that, had a successful career in senior executive and sales roles at companies
such as Adidas, Reebok and Procter & Gamble. We also attracted key senior management leaders including Michael


-----

Hauge Sørensen as the Chief Operating Officer, Andrew E. Page as the Chief Financial Officer and Victor Chen as
the Chief Strategy Officer. These team members bring a wealth of corporate experience from global companies
including Adidas, Reebok, Procter & Gamble, Boston Consulting Group, ECCO, Footlocker, General Electric,
Pandora and Under Armour.

Importantly, we also reset the leadership in each of our segments and infused the organization with a deep

bench of talent with experience growing global brands. We appointed Stuart C. Haselden to lead Arc’teryx and Peak
Performance. Mr. Haselden has experience with fast growing brands having previously served as the Chief
Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer at Lululemon Athletica as well other senior executive roles at brands
such as J .Crew. We appointed Franco Fogliato to lead Salomon. Mr. Fogliato has extensive outdoor experience with
large global portfolios, having previously served as an Executive Vice President of Global Omnichannel at
Columbia Sportswear with additional experience at The North Face and Billabong. We promoted Joseph Dudy to
lead Wilson. Mr. Dudy has worked at Wilson for more than 28 years and has a deep understanding of the brand
having previously served as Wilson’s Chief Financial Officer. Under his leadership, Wilson has experienced strong
growth in racquet sports, including new racquet categories such as padel and pickleball, won a contract with the
NBA to once again be its exclusive basketball provider and licensee, and deepened its relationship with the NFL.
Lastly, we appointed John Yao as General Manager of Amer Sports Greater China to closely coordinate brand
success with global teams in this important region. John previously helped lead Nike’s business in Greater China for
over 17 years.

In addition to resetting our leaderships teams, we have made considerable investments to attract top-tier

industry talent across the Amer Sports group. We have attracted highly experienced and successful talent from some
of the world’s leading brands. These talented individuals bring deep industry knowledge and capabilities in key
areas such as brand marketing, product design, merchandising and DTC go-to- market strategies.

**_Rationalized Brand Portfolio_**

As part of our transformation, we performed a detailed evaluation of our brand portfolio to determine which

brands are core to our strategic initiatives. We identified opportunities to rationalize our portfolio and divested
Mavic in 2019, Precor in 2021 and Suunto in 2022. We are focused on core brands within our segments which have
large market opportunities and significant upside potential, and we have allocated our capital and resources
accordingly to achieve our strategic growth plan.

**_Recent Financial Performance_**

Our transformation has resulted in strong revenue growth, gross margin improvement and an increase in

operating profitability. Comparing 2022 and 2020, we achieved the following results:

  - increase in revenue from $2.4 billion to $3.5 billion, representing a CAGR of 20.4%

  - increase in gross margin from 47.0% to 49.7%

  - increase in net loss from $237.2 million to $252.7 million

  - increase in Adjusted EBITDA from $311.4 million to $453.0 million, representing a CAGR of 20.6%

Comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we achieved the following

results:

  - increase in revenue from $2.4 billion to $3.1 billion, representing a growth rate of 29.9%

  - increase in gross margin from 49.4% to 52.2%

  - increase in net loss from $104.4 million to $113.9 million

  - increase in Adjusted EBITDA from $261.8 million to $422.1 million, representing a growth rate of 61.3%

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following competitive strengths have been key drivers of our success to date and

strategically position us for continued success. Although we believe these competitive strengths will contribute to
the growth and success of our company, our business is subject to risks that may prevent us from achieving our
business objectives or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk
Factors” for a discussion of these risks, which you should consider carefully before making an investment decision
to purchase the notes.

**_Iconic Leading Brands in Attractive Diversified Categories_**

Our dynamic portfolio of iconic brands is featured at the pinnacle of sports and power “winning moments” for

professional athletes and amateurs alike. Our brands are defined by innovative, excellent products with superior
quality, sustainability and thoughtful design, enabling them to be “market shapers” and leaders in intensely
competitive markets for products, services and experiences. For example, Arc’teryx produces specialty climbing and
mountain apparel worn from the foot to the peak of the Canadian Rockies, Salomon attracts the best athletes with its
footwear and winter sports equipment from the French Alps to trails across the world and Wilson Sporting Goods is
a market leader for tennis equipment, baseball gloves, baseball and softball bats, basketballs and footballs. With
multiple brands that are market leaders in their respective categories, we have a diversified, resilient portfolio. The
consistency and profitability of our hard goods categories are complemented by multiple forward growth levers,
including double digit, profitable growth in soft goods across large markets.

As a group, our brands are complementary to one another while also geographically and seasonally diversified.

We serve a wide range of global athletic and outdoor activities year-round. The relationship among our brands
positions us to outfit the outdoor athlete from head to toe. For example, an outdoor athlete can ski on Atomic in the
winter, wear an Arc’teryx jacket when rock climbing in the fall and run with Salomon shoes year round. Our market
leadership in numerous categories, combined with the diversification of our portfolio, allows us to serve consumers
around the world at all times of the year and reduces the aggregate level of seasonality across our business.
Nevertheless, changes in market trends and consumer preferences could adversely affect our results of operations.

**_Authentic Brand Connection with Consumers across Performance Levels_**

We believe our brands are individually and collectively genuine, true to the aligned group and brand values and

purposeful in delivering on promises to our communities. The authenticity of our brands connects us to sports and


-----

outdoor enthusiasts who associate our brands with quality craftsmanship, leading innovation and a passion for
athletics and the outdoors. An Arc’teryx consumer sees a high-end climbing and ski brand while a Wilson consumer
sees it as a leader in tennis. Our credibility is supported by strong brand heritage along with professional athletes
across sports leagues and activities choosing to use our brands’ products. At the same time, our products fit and
appeal to consumers of all skill levels. This genuine brand equity helps us drive attention and traffic to our brands,
with everyday consumers seeking to align themselves with the carefully crafted brand images we have curated over
time.

Core to the identity of each of our brands is our mission to enhance consumer experiences. In doing so, our

brands foster a sense of belonging. We create thriving communities that are passionate about the sports and activities
we support and are loyal to our brands. Arc’teryx hosts community events at retail locations and in the outdoors that
bring thousands of people together in an authentic way. At ski resorts globally, Salomon, Atomic, Armada and
Arc’teryx brand awareness grows naturally as millions of outdoor enthusiasts see some of the most skilled athletes
using our brands. We believe the authenticity of our brands attracts consumers, drives brand affinity and builds a
growing loyal following.

**_Performance Products Driven by Consumer-focused Innovation_**

Our products are rooted in innovation and technical excellence, and set the standard for quality, function and

style across their respective categories. Through a consumer-focused, design-led mindset, we emphasize
understanding and meeting the evolving needs and demands of athletes and consumers. Our innovation processes
are institutionalized through continued investment in research and development at our innovation centers. These
include the Wilson Innovation Center in Chicago, Arc’teryx design centers in North Vancouver, Portland and Tokyo
and Salomon’s Annecy Design Center in France. Our teams are constantly testing new ideas to improve our current
offering and to be the first to commercialize new products, while balancing the potential lack of receptivity of new
products, as well as shifting consumer preferences.

Our brands are supported by former competitive athletes who enjoy an active lifestyle and have a desire to lean

into hard problems and apply design to create possibility. We have an expansive network of hundreds of
professional athletes and ambassadors across our brands who we actively collaborate with. We gather feedback,
insights and ideas from them to incorporate into our designs. This direct feedback drives our product innovation
engine and results in high-end products that are trusted by our consumers. We leverage advanced technologies to
constantly improve our products and reaffirm the pricing power our brands command. For example, Wilson has
driven innovation across sports including football, baseball, tennis and golf for over a century. Today, that culture of
innovation is present in each of our brands as we are using artificial intelligence to design a baseball bat with a
larger sweet spot, we have used 3D printing to create an airless basketball, and we use sensors and cameras on skiers
to improve ski edge designs. Design features across our brands include Arc’teryx and Salomon developing new,
greener membranes with Gore-Tex for their jackets and shoes, improving the waterproofing and breathability,
Salomon’s patented Sensifit footwear technology providing precise and comfortable fit in combination with the
differentiated Quicklace system and Wilson’s cushion core carcass in its basketballs designed to ensure an easy grip
for players. In recent years, design teams at our brands have also invested in the development of products, packaging
and services with a sustainability focus, such as Wilson’s Triniti™ tennis balls made of certain materials that
enhance product longevity and using recyclable packaging and Salomon’s MTN Summit alpine boot with ecodesigned features. Our products’ shape their respective categories with innovative technologies fueled by our deep
commitment to rigorous research and development.

**_Global Market Access with Scale and Global Points of Presence_**

Collectively, we are a scaled global business with diverse geographic reach and distribution. In 2022, 42% of

our revenue was from the Americas, 36% from EMEA, 7% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 15%
from Greater China. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 40% of our revenue was from the Americas,
33% from EMEA, 8% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 19% from Greater China. All around the
globe, our brands are guided by a consumer-first mindset and meet consumers exactly where they shop, in both
digital and physical spaces. Each brand boasts a multi-channel distribution strategy that is tailored to the brand’s
product assortment. For example, Salomon has strong access to key specialty retailers in remote mountain locations
where consumers buy trail running and winter sports equipment, where the customer base differs significantly from
sporting good chains. Arc’teryx is oriented towards a DTC model with next generation retail locations that
illuminate the brand identity and resonate with consumers, tailored to consumer preferences by region.

As a group, we deploy a vertically integrated, DTC mindset, while leveraging our network of strong wholesale

relationships. We are increasingly emphasizing our owned e-commerce and building out our owned retail
distribution around the world. As of September 30, 2023, we have over 330 owned retail stores and growing. Our
owned retail stores serve as attractive marketing tools that elevate the consumer experience, and, with the help of instore activations and events, enhance brand loyalty, build communities and generate a strong return-on-investment.
Our owned retail benefits our global e-commerce business, which has grown significantly across all brands, up 88%
from 2020 to 2022. The combination of our wholesale and DTC channels, along with our global infrastructure allow
our brands to connect with consumers conveniently and seamlessly around the world.

While our business and revenues are geographically diverse, this is the aggregate result of an extensive global

footprint built and expanded at the local level and fostered over decades. Today we have owned retail stores in 24
countries representing generations of investment in local communities, which allows us the flexibility to tailor our
approach to best meet the needs of local markets. We are nimble across markets and able to replicate success of new
product launches in one region globally in a short period of time given our investments in our growing worldwide
network.

**_Differentiated Operating Model Supporting Our Brands_**

Our global platform supports the brands in key functional areas such as financial controls, capital allocation,

compliance and sustainability. IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, vendor administration and communication functions
are areas in which we seek to ensure the ongoing protection of shared assets. We also serve the brands in areas such
as human resources, financial reporting, automation and continuous technological improvement. Across these
functional areas, our brands benefit from infrastructure that they would not be able to build cost efficiently as standalone entities. The scale advantages of our platform can be observed in the over $1.4 billion in annual procurement


-----

spend we undertake across 176 suppliers in 32 countries as well as 19 distribution centers, of which we operate 9,
globally as of September 30, 2023. In essence, our brands enjoy the benefits of access to a high-quality global
supply chain commensurate with a greater than $3 billion revenue platform. The shared resources not only create
synergies for the brands across each of our segments, but also empower them to prioritize and optimize brand
strategy and performance.

**_Proven Ability to Win in Greater China_**

Since 2018, our capabilities in Greater China have expanded as our group headcount in the region has increased

from approximately 450 to 800 employees as of September 30, 2023. We have realized significant success in the
region through a commercialization strategy specific to the Chinese market. Our leaders are empowered to make
decisions quickly so that we can compete to win in a dynamic and evolving Chinese retail landscape. While the
brand experience for consumers is consistent with each brand’s global ethos, we employ localization strategies that
resonate with Chinese consumers. For example, Arc’teryx’s loyalty program includes over 1.7 million members in
Greater China as of September 30, 2023, having grown from only fourteen thousand in 2018 due to the brand’s
ability to leverage tools such as WeChat to accelerate loyalty member enrollment.

Our strategy in Greater China also leverages a precise retail rollout combined with operational excellence. Store

locations are selected using detailed data analysis, and we are keenly focused on optimizing store size and storelevel productivity. Each location seeks to bring to life our authentic brand stories. Our operational excellence allows
us to refresh retail inventory on a regular cadence, helping to drive consistent traffic and excitement in our stores
and facilitating a luxury experience. We have already demonstrated success in Greater China, having grown our
revenue from $202.3 million in 2020 to $523.8 million in 2022, representing a 60.9% CAGR, and operating margins
in the region exceeds the margins of the business overall. Our revenue from Greater China has continued to grow in
2023, with $593.0 million revenue derived from the region for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, up from
$353.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing a growth rate of 67.6%. In addition,
while our initial success in Greater China was largely related to growth of Arc’teryx, we have developed a
repeatable playbook with Salomon, which grew its revenue in Greater China by 72% from 2021 to 2022.

We believe we are in the preliminary stages of addressing our growth opportunity in Greater China as our

brands continue to be recognized and appreciated by consumers in Greater China, while our proven ability to tailor
and execute a regional strategy highlights our global potential.

**_Highly Experienced Management Team with Deep Bench of Talent_**

Our strategic vision, operational execution and company culture are driven by our executive leadership team,

which has a proven track record in developing sportswear brands on a global scale. At the brand level, we have a
deep bench of leaders that have significant experience building DTC retail strategies and unrivaled expertise in
accessing fast growing markets. Our brand CEOs operate with a high degree of autonomy and support from group
management. Within each brand organization, we have highly talented individuals executing key functionalities,
including brand marketing, product development and operations. Across the organization, one third of employees at
the top two leadership tiers of the company are individuals hired within the last two years, allowing for fresh
perspectives to partner with experienced talent driving strong execution.

**Our Growth Strategies**

We have established comprehensive growth strategies across each of our brands, founded on the pillars of

product innovation, geographic expansion, channel mix optimization and increased brand awareness. We intend to
leverage both the intrinsic strengths of our brands and the synergistic benefits of our platform to pursue the
following growth strategies:

**_Leverage Innovation Leadership to Strengthen Core Categories and Scale Newer Categories_**

The foundation of our brands’ success comes from an ability to innovate and create products that appeal to both

elite athletes and everyday consumers. We believe our innovation model, which has been institutionalized across
brands in each of our three segments, will allow us to expand our market shares within core categories, as well as
tactically scale in newer categories.


-----

Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx employs a hands-on, iterative product development process that begins

with innovative ideas in the North Vancouver design center. These product innovations come to life via on-site
prototyping at the nearby ARC’One facility. Further, the team rigorously tests the product in the Canadian Coast
Mountains with world-class mountain athletes. This results in a product that meets our high quality standards and
drives continuous innovation. Core innovation enables products like the Alpha SV waterproof breathable
“hardshell” jacket to consistently be among Arc’teryx’s top selling products, supporting the brand’s market
leadership within outdoor technical apparel and driving continued topline growth. Along with core outdoor category
growth, Arc’teryx plans to grow its women’s category, where it has invested in new design leadership, including an
expanded assortment, color palette and updated fits, along with rigorous engagement with female athletes to further
expand market share with female consumers. For new product development, Arc’teryx recently opened a footwear
development office in Portland, Oregon to be able to provide a more comprehensive offering to the outdoor
consumer, while also further diversifying product line seasonality. Arc’teryx is also expanding its product portfolio
through its popular contemporary urban lifestyle line, Veilance. These new categories are supplemented by
sustainability programs, including ReCare™, ReCut™ and ReGear™. ReCare™ provides consumers with
information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that
are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for
sale on the ReGear™ platform.

Within Outdoor Performance, Salomon is deeply committed to innovation in footwear, reflected by its world
class design center in Annecy, France, along with a professional athlete collaboration program to design nextgeneration products. Through trail running, Salomon has been influential in shaping the modern outdoor footwear
industry, rich in heritage of the French Alps. These innovations fuel the future of the sport, recently being worn by
Courtney Dauwalter as she set back-to-back records at the Western States Endurance Race 100-mile run, and three
weeks later, in the Hardrock 100 with the same pair of S/LAB Genesis shoes. S/LAB is the brand’s halo collection
of specialty running and Nordic ski systems which have won races from the UTMB in Chamonix France to the 2022
Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, China. The brand’s ADDIKT PRO on-piste ski line is made with recycled ABS
sidewalls, demonstrating Salomon’s leading innovation.

Historically, innovation has supported the evolution of Salomon’s iconic products like the XT-6, which was

launched in 2013 and originally designed for ultra-distance trail runners under harsh conditions. This silhouette now
creates the foundation of Salomon’s rapidly growing Sportstyle line, which creates a blend between function and
fashion that is loved by athletes and consumers alike and represents a significant opportunity for the brand. Salomon
Sportstyle footwear has become so culturally relevant that the MM6 Maison Margiela x Salomon Cross Low shoes
have been worn by global superstars, including during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show, which was viewed by
more than 115 million people globally. Sportstyle is the fastest growing collection in the Salomon brand with
revenue over $80 million in 2022, and over $165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Salomon also demonstrates an unwavering commitment to producing high-quality equipment for winter sports.

During the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, athletes using Salomon products went on to win 28 Olympic
medals, showcasing the technical excellence of the brand’s winter sports equipment from skis, ski boots, ski
bindings, snowboards, snowboard boots and bindings. Two-time World Cup Overall Alpine ski racer Marco
Odermatt has relied exclusively on Salomon ski boots and bindings in his wins. Salomon intends to continue
leveraging its premier innovation capabilities to improve existing product lines as well as develop new products to
drive growth and increase market share.

In Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson’s in-house innovation capabilities, anchored by its innovation center located

in Chicago, provide a competitive advantage and an engine for continuous growth. The brand’s significant scale,
particularly compared to mono-sport competitors, allows Wilson to make significant investments in research and
development. The innovation process leverages key insights from technical scientists, engineers and designers who
have a deep understanding of sports and the technical needs of athletes who use Wilson products. For example, as of
September 1, 2023, 27% of the top 100 men’s tennis players and 42% of the top 100 women’s players in the world
use Wilson rackets.

Other recent innovation examples include a Louisville Slugger baseball bat that uses simulation software

combined with artificial intelligence, first utilized in the golf space and then expanded to baseball, to enhance the
contact sweet spot, or the Evo NXT basketball that redistributes the weight of the ball with an advanced internal
construction, making the ball easier to shoot from long range. New product introductions accounted for
approximately 21% to 22% of revenue each year from 2020 to 2022 for Wilson, and accounted for approximately


-----

21% of the brand’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These product innovations drive market
share growth in core sports as well as adjacent categories such as the increasingly popular games of padel in Europe
and pickleball in the United States.

As a new growth lever, Wilson is expanding its reach in soft goods categories in addition to sports equipment.

Wilson is already experiencing success with its Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy, which involves launching tennis
footwear and increasing exposure to apparel and represented 3.7% of total Wilson sales during the year ended
December 31, 2022 and 5.1% of total Wilson sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We believe
this category will continue to grow as a larger contributor to the Wilson business and help fuel broader brand
engagement.

Across segments, our plans to innovate, expand our product offering and successfully implement our growth

strategy may not be successful, and implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and
administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.

**_Further Penetrate Key Markets and Strategically Broaden Our Geographic Footprint_**

While our brands across each of our three segments have achieved global recognition, there are specific markets

where they enjoy greater prominence: Arc’teryx in North America and Greater China, Salomon in Europe and
Wilson in North America. By capitalizing on our existing global presence and leveraging our brands’ strengths, we
have a significant opportunity to strategically increase our presence in existing and new geographies by cultivating
new customer bases where there is promising market demand and ample room for growth.

Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx’s future geographic growth will be grounded in its historical momentum

in North America and Greater China, with considerable opportunity in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. In North
America and Greater China, the brand operates 48 and 63 owned retail stores, including seven and 21 factory
outlets, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. During the period from 2019 to September 30, 2023, the brand has
opened a net total of 30 new stores in Greater China, as well as a net total of 20 new stores in North America, with a
net total of three additional stores opened during the fourth quarter of 2023. In Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific,
Arc’teryx operates six and 21 owned retail stores, including two and five factory outlets, respectively, as of
September 30, 2023. The brand intends to continue developing its retail real estate portfolio in these markets to drive
brand awareness and growth. In Europe, there are retail opportunities in large metro areas such as Paris, as well as
iconic, outdoor locations across the Alps, including Chamonix, France, Zermatt, Switzerland and St. Anton, Austria,
where important community-building “mountain stores” are targeted to create authentic brand positioning.

Within owned retail stores, Arc’teryx brand stores (excluding factory outlets) represent a key element of our

overall growth strategy and vertical model. We use sales per square foot to assess the performance of Arc’teryx
brand stores relative to their square footage. Sales per square foot is calculated using total sales from all brand stores
(excluding factory outlets) that were open for the prior twelve month period, divided by their total square footage.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, in North America, Arc’teryx’s sales per square
foot increased from $622 to $817, calculated on the basis of revenue of $43.9 million from 24 brand stores with an
aggregate of 70,676 square feet in 2021 and $68.9 million from 29 brand stores with an aggregate of 84,367 square
feet in 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, in Greater China,
Arc’teryx’s sales per square foot increased from $1,251 to $1,269, calculated on the basis of revenue of $97.0
million from 35 brand stores with an aggregate of 77,586 square feet in 2021 and $126.5 million from 38 brand
stores with an aggregate of 99,652 square feet in 2022, respectively. This measure of sales per square foot may not
be equivalent to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies.

For the 27 brand stores (excluding factory stores) open in North America during the twelve month period

ending September 30, 2023 with an aggregate square feet of 79,072, brand store revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 was $54.0 million, compared to $36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, these stores generated $66.6 million in revenue. For the 36 brand stores
(excluding factory stores) in Greater China open during the twelve month period ending September 30, 2023 with an
aggregate square feet of 100,944, brand store revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $155.8
million, compared to $73.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For the year ended December 31,
2022 these stores generated $124.9 million in revenue.


-----

Within Outdoor Performance, while Salomon is relatively well known in Europe, we believe brand awareness is

significantly lower in Greater China and the United States. These markets represent strong growth opportunities as
the technical performance, innovative design and premium nature of the brand’s products, especially within
footwear, align well with consumer preferences in these markets. In Greater China, Salomon has successfully
opened 30 owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023 and has plans to accelerate its retail rollout in this market.
Despite still emerging brand awareness, Salomon enjoys specialty niche market positioning in the United States,
including being well known for its winter sports equipment. According to the Circana/Retail Tracking Service, it is
the number two outdoor footwear brand in the United States for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based
on dollar sales.

Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has a compelling opportunity to leverage its reputation for technical

excellence in various sports activities, stemming from its historical success in the North American market. Wilson
plans to expand its market leadership in North America while driving growth in both Greater China and Europe. In
these newer markets, Wilson plans to leverage its partnership with the NBA as well as capitalize on increasing
participation in sports and outdoor activities such as tennis. In Greater China, we believe that higher levels of
participation in sports by children, young adults and women provide an opportunity to leverage the Tennis 360
Softgoods strategy to drive apparel and footwear growth while also developing a strong brand relationship with a
large and dynamic consumer base. In Europe, Wilson plans to leverage its product authority in racquet sports to
drive market share gains in padel, which is a popular fast-growing sport in the region. Fast growing sports like padel
and pickleball are also fragmented and provide Wilson an opportunity to innovate on currently relatively
standardized equipment.

**_Optimize Go-to-market Strategies to Conveniently Engage Consumers_**

Each of our brands employs a customized go-to-market strategy that is tailored specifically to the brand’s

attributes and designed to effectively reach and captivate consumers. We remain committed to further refining and
enhancing our go-to-market strategies with the goal of expanding our market presence, fostering customer loyalty
and driving growth. Our DTC strategy will continue to require significant investment and management focus and
may present risks and challenges, while our wholesale strategy may be impacted by the strength of our relationships
with our wholesale partners.

Within Technical Apparel, for Arc’teryx, the DTC channel is the primary vehicle to engage consumers and

drives both online and offline conversions. The DTC channel allows Arc’teryx to seamlessly leverage grassroots
community marketing strategies and provides for a more agile inventory management model focused on consistent
flow of fresh product. While Arc’teryx has a selective wholesale footprint that will remain an important element in
its distribution strategy, we expect owned retail and e-commerce to continue to enable DTC to be the brand’s fastest
growing channel.

  - _Retail Brand Stores: Elevated brand stores provide a critical space for Arc’teryx to engage directly with_
consumers, showcase products and build community. Its retail store strategy has evolved to include three
differentiated store formats with square footage generally ranging from 1,000-10,000 sq. ft. With multiple
store formats, the brand has expanded its retail store network, with a focus on global retail hubs like
Shanghai and New York. The brand stores are highly productive with an average global sales per square
foot of approximately $1,474 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

Brand stores generally have been profitable with a target payback period of 24 months, with actual performance

generally exceeding targets based on our global brand store openings for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023. The ReBird™ Care and Repair centers, incorporated in several new stores opened since 2022, have been an
important element of the brand’s immersive store experience, not only to enhance our efforts in improving the
circularity and reusability of our products, but also to drive traffic and consumer engagement.

  - _E-commerce: Arc’teryx’s digital platform is a catalyst for the business across all channels by growing_
brand awareness and serving as a global “storefront” for products and brand identity. We believe the
Arc’teryx e-commerce platform will continue to grow as brand awareness accelerates through brand and
community marketing investments, which contribute to Arc’teryx’s ability to adapt its business based on
consumer data received from this platform.


-----

Within Outdoor Performance, we have optimized Salomon’s go-to-market strategy from a traditional wholesale

model to a modern and balanced consumer-centric retail strategy. The strategy is designed to elevate the brand by
selectively choosing premium wholesale partners, curating and segmenting the inventory assortment with them,
while also reaching more consumers on a direct basis through owned retail and e-commerce and providing engaging
consumer experiences. While the channel mix remains primarily wholesale, DTC has grown significantly from 18%
of brand revenue in 2020 to 21% in 2022 in an effort to drive penetration globally.

  - _Direct-to-Consumer: The brand has a strategic retail expansion plan, focusing on the development of multi-_
sport, experiential store formats in select major global cities, such as Paris and Milan, as well as increasing
the number of Sportstyle focused stores in Greater China. For e-commerce, Salomon recently redesigned its
website with a vision to inspire, guide and equip new and returning consumers to unleash their potential
through mountain sports. We believe the platform provides an immersive and frictionless brand experience
which has led to increased traffic and conversion. We expect growth on the e-commerce platform to scale
with retail expansion as brand awareness increases and Salomon builds larger brand communities.

  - _Wholesale: Salomon targets high-quality wholesale partners, including specialty retailers, globally to attract_
new consumers. The brand collaborates with partners to drive higher per door productivity. Many of the
brand’s specialty retailer partners focus directly on Salomon’s core competencies, including product
expertise in hiking and trail running. Within outdoor and trail running shoes, Salomon is focused on
consolidating the number of accounts and improving productivity. Within the Sportstyle category, Salomon
is similarly focused on improving productivity while expanding the number of retail partners carrying the
brand’s products. Salomon intends to further increase its number of strategic wholesale accounts in Europe,
especially in underpenetrated areas of Western Europe, as well as the United States where Salomon seeks
to target top-tier sporting goods retailers.

Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson Sporting Goods’ go-to-market strategy revolves around highly

productive wholesale relationships complemented by owned retail stores and an e-commerce platform that create
excitement around Wilson’s categories and elevate Wilson’s brand. The wholesale channel is pivotal for Wilson as
we believe many consumers prefer to shop in stores where expert recommendations are available and can be critical
to driving the point-of-sale for sporting goods. Approximately 50% of Wilson’s wholesale revenue in 2022 and in
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 came from differentiated specialty retailers. Through strong wholesale
relationships and a complementary DTC strategy, Wilson aims to continue increasing consumer engagement in the
appropriate channels. Importantly, while Wilson’s owned store footprint is expected to remain relatively small and
targeted, these stores serve as important consumer touchpoints to build engagement with the brand in high-quality,
immersive retail environments.

  - _Wholesale: Wilson’s wholesale channel comprises more than 15,000 wholesale partners globally for the_
year ended December 31, 2022, balanced between traditional and specialty retailers and smaller pro shops
and country clubs. Through internal, specialized sales teams, Wilson closely collaborates with its wholesale
partners to deliver a premium and educational consumer experience that drives brand productivity. From
2020 to 2022, Wilson meaningfully increased wholesale productivity with two of its top wholesale
partners, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy, each increasing revenue by 101% and 73%, respectively.
As Wilson continues to deliver superior products, it intends to continue increasing productivity and shelf
space with strategic wholesale partners.

  - _Direct-to-Consumer: Wilson leverages DTC channels to complement its wholesale strategy by increasing_
brand awareness and elevating the brand. Wilson has owned retail stores in strategic locations, such as New
York City and Chicago, which provide an immersive consumer experience and illuminate Wilson’s
leadership across categories. The brand’s retail strategy is complemented by a global e-commerce platform
with innovative digital capabilities, such as a direct-to-team baseball offering that leverages Wilson’s
dynamic portfolio of brands and connections with baseball academies, clubs and organizations. Overall, we
believe DTC will continue to play a critical role in driving traffic and conversion for Wilson in both the
DTC and wholesale channels as brand equity and awareness grow.

**_Grow Brand Awareness, Expand Our Communities and Increase Customer Loyalty_**

We believe efforts to drive higher levels of brand awareness and increased customer loyalty across key markets

are critical for each of our brands to achieve their commercial potential. As such, each brand has developed robust


-----

global marketing programs that build on the authenticity of each brand through strategies ranging from “grass roots”
local community activities, to large scale global on-mountain events, to sophisticated original content and social
media campaigns that leverage digital marketing.

Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx has created a reputation of authenticity and an uncompromising standard

of excellence. The result has created a passionate, loyal following for the brand. However, Arc’teryx global brand
awareness levels are relatively low when compared to more established premium outerwear brands. The brand plans
to tactically increase brand awareness and curate more passionate communities through the following global
strategies:

  - _Arc’teryx Academies: Each year, Arc’teryx hosts several global events in some of the most iconic alpine_
destinations around the world such as Chamonix, France; St. Anton, Austria and Whistler, British
Columbia. Each Academy focuses on a different mountain sport discipline and is open to the public. In
2022, these events saw over 17,500 attendees and generated 76.5 million media impressions.

  - _Store-Driven Events: Arc’teryx’s events enable the brand to connect to the communities surrounding the_
brand’s stores. These events range from design discussions, music performances, to speaker series hosted
both in-store and online.

  - _Original Content + Digital and Social Media: In 2022, Arc’teryx has produced 15 original content films_
with talented filmmakers that featured sponsored athletes. These films included examples such as
Unfinished Business, a documentary about Greg Hill summiting all 20 peaks of the Spearhead Traverse in
one day and Keep It Real, a video on the underground UK bouldering scene that provided original content
to enable authentic brand storytelling across social media channels. We believe original content combined
with digital marketing strategies will increase Arc’teryx brand awareness globally.

Within Outdoor Performance, while the Salomon brand has existed for more than 75 years, we believe there is

an opportunity to grow brand awareness globally, particularly in North America and Greater China. To drive brand
awareness, Salomon plans to use the following integrated, brand-first marketing strategy to communicate key
product stories:

  - _Television, Digital and Social Media: Using television, digital and social media, Salomon plans to_
effectively communicate its brand story to a large audience of consumers and form a deeper connection. For
example, in 2022, Salomon unveiled the new “Tomorrow is Yours” campaign aimed at inspiring a wider,
younger and more diverse audience to connect with the outdoors. We believe this comprehensive global
campaign increased brand awareness and perception globally.

  - _Brand Ambassadors: Professional athletes trust Salomon in the most demanding competitive environments,_
which is the greatest form of product validation. In total, more than 600 professional athletes across trail
running, snowboarding and alpine and Nordic skiing actively use Salomon products. These athletes provide
individual product and brand storytelling opportunities to drive awareness.

  - _Loyalty Program: In 2022, Salomon launched its loyalty program, S/Plus which allows consumers to earn_
points for each purchase, access exclusive products and receive other members only benefits. The S/Plus
program had over 1.2 million members as of December 31, 2022, the first year of its existence, and over 1.5
million members as of September 30, 2023.

  - _[Original Content: Salomon.tv originated in 2009 as the original branded content platform in sports. As of](https://salomon.tv/)_
September 30, 2023, more than 245,000 subscribers view 6-10 original and authentic stories per year
highlighting athletes, sports, products and community.

  - _Events: Salomon has developed a leading series of running events in some of the most iconic outdoor_
destinations around the world called The Golden Trail Series (“GTS”). These events are the only running
events in the world designed and developed for a global television audience. In 2023, GTS events will be
broadcasted on Eurosport across 53 countries. Salomon plans to further increase spending to add events in
Japan and Greater China to complement the United States and European races, entrenching Salomon as the
leading global brand powering the sport of trail running.

Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has recently elevated its brand through consistent, cohesive brand

messaging across sports categories. Today Wilson is thoughtfully balancing product marketing and brand marketing
to engage consumers, and it intends to continue growing its brand awareness in key global markets through the
following strategies:

  - _Professional Partnerships: For more than 110 years, Wilson has been and continues to be a part of_
championship-level performance for some of the world’s best athletes and iconic sports leagues. These
endorsements and partnerships serve as a competitive advantage, providing a differentiated opportunity to
convey a story around “Play What the Pros Play.” Wilson plans to continue leveraging these partnerships
with both professional leagues and young aspiring talent across sport activities to build brand awareness
globally.

  - _Strategic Marketing: Known for product excellence across sport categories, Wilson is establishing a_
cohesive brand identity that sources and amplifies brand equity from each categories’ leadership and
authenticity, effectively shifting from category marketing to brand marketing. Wilson leverages digital
marketing, social media platforms, experiential concepts and collaborations with brands such as KITH to
deliver authentic brand and product messaging to consumers. The digital marketing strategy combines
personalized targeting, engaging content and data-driven optimization to build brand awareness and drive
consumer engagement. In 2022, the brand launched a marketing program for everyone to “Live Like an
Athlete,” which immediately increased the brand’s social media engagement. Wilson continues to build on
this brand momentum through the Wilson Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy and a comprehensive brand
campaign delivered in 2023.

**_Leverage the Amer Sports Platform to Scale All of Our Brands_**

We have laid the foundation and infrastructure to enable premium brands to thrive and scale on the Amer Sports

platform. The ability for brands to chart their own consumer-centric strategies while leveraging the global scale and
capabilities of our platform provides an opportunity for all our brands across each of our three segments to
accelerate their growth in a profitable manner. For example, Atomic and Peak Performance have an opportunity to
leverage our platform to increase their presence globally. Atomic is a leading player in winter sports as validated
through the use of Atomic equipment by some of the world’s best alpine athletes, including Mikaela Shiffrin. We
intend to leverage this professional brand halo to capture additional market share in the global winter sports
equipment industry and further extend the Atomic brand to apparel and accessories. Given its Nordic roots, Peak
Performance has a strong following within EMEA; however, there is an opportunity to expand the brand globally in
the Americas, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific.

**Our Market Opportunity**

Our brands operate across several markets, including the athletic apparel, athletic footwear and sports

equipment markets. These are global markets and form a collective market opportunity of approximately $522
billion as of 2022.

  - _Global Athletic Apparel Market: According to Euromonitor International, the global athletic apparel market_
represented $220 billion in annual spending in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.4% CAGR through
2027.

  - _Global Athletic Footwear Market: According to Euromonitor International, the global athletic footwear_
market represented $152 billion in annual spending in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.8% CAGR
through 2027.

We believe our global capabilities and presence, especially within Greater China, positions us well to drive

growth in the athletic apparel and athletic footwear markets globally.

  - _Global Sports Equipment Market: According to Statista, the global sports equipment market, which_
includes golf, outdoor, racquet, team sports and winter sports, represented $75 billion in annual spend in
2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR through 2027.

We believe the following trends influence the industries within which we operate and how consumers make

their purchase decisions:

  - _Health & Longevity: We believe one of the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is an increased focus_
on health and longevity, resulting in increased participation in sports across genders, ages and geographies.
For example, according to a survey conducted by a third-party research consulting group, approximately
50% of US consumers reported wellness as a top priority in their daily lives in 2022, an increase from 42%
in 2020. We believe this increased focus on health and longevity is a trend that will continue and will drive
consumers to purchase sports apparel, footwear and equipment to facilitate a healthy lifestyle through
sports and outdoor recreation.

  - _Increased Casualization: There has been a shift towards more casual apparel and footwear options for_
daily use, a trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. This casualization trend drives the need for
products that can offer versatility across of a variety of use cases, whether in the office, or participating in
outdoor activities. We believe our premium apparel and footwear products provide the necessary style,
comfort and technical performance to allow consumers to seamlessly transition from one activity to the
next while feeling confident throughout the day.

  - _Growth in the Premium Consumer Segment: Our brands target consumers who seek high-quality, premium_
performance products to help them perform at their best and feel confident on-and-off the court. According
to the Credit Suisse 2022 Global Wealth Report, the number of adults globally with a net worth of
$100,000 or more, which we define as the premium consumer segment, has increased from 358 million in
2010 to 689 million in 2021, representing a CAGR of 6.1%. We believe our brands and products are
positioned as premium products and enable us to capitalize on growth in the number of premium
consumers.

  - _Sustainable Consumption: We believe sustainable consumption is at the forefront of many consumers’_
decision whether to engage or transact with a brand. According to a recent third-party survey of U.S.
consumers, sustainability is increasingly influencing consumer behavior. We believe the consumer’s focus
on sustainable consumption will be a continued trend and that consumers will seek out sustainability
minded companies when making purchases.

**Our Brands and Products**

Our portfolio consists of 11 globally recognized brands in our three segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor

Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports.


-----

**Technical Apparel**

**_Arc’teryx_**

are located, a remote area with challenging terrain that provides the perfect environment for the brand to test
products in real-world conditions. We believe this resource allows the team to create some of the best-fitting,
longest-lasting, and highest-functioning technical products with unrivaled performance at the point of extreme need.

Arc’teryx’s product offering includes technical outdoor apparel, footwear and accessories, including climbing

gear.

**_Peak Performance_**

and various other professional and recreational sports, as well as functional athletic apparel.


-----

**_Louisville Slugger_**

Louisville Slugger was founded in 1884 in Louisville, Kentucky and today is one of the most iconic brands in

the world of baseball equipment. We believe the name Louisville Slugger is synonymous with high- quality,
handcrafted wooden baseball bats that have been used by some of the world’s most legendary players, including
Hall of Famers, MVPs and World Series champions. The brand continues to be loved and respected in the world of
baseball, representing tradition, craftsmanship and excellence.

**_DeMarini_**

DeMarini prioritizes performance and constantly innovates in baseball, fastpitch and slowpitch softball with

bats designed and built in the United States. DeMarini was founded in 1989 and has over 60,000 square feet of
facilities used purely for R&D and manufacturing. In 2016, DeMarini introduced its online custom bat builder,
which we believe was the industry’s first.

**_EvoShield_**

EvoShield offers custom-fitting protective gear and apparel with Gel-to-Shell[®] Technology for baseball,

softball, football and lacrosse. EvoShield was founded in 2002, has over 30 sponsored professional athletes and
provides equipment to world class athletes.

offers pitching machines that can fire fly balls over 350 feet from home plate and tops out with fastballs at 100 miles
per hour.

**Sustainability**

Two of the most prominent trends of our time are at the heart of Amer Sports’ business: health and longevity,

and sustainable consumption. As a global group of sports and outdoor brands, we are in a position to encourage
more sustainable lifestyles and mindful consumption and promote well-being. While the sports and outdoor industry
connects us with nature, it also consumes our planet’s precious resources, and the complex supply chains in our
industry are challenging to manage in a responsible way. All this calls for an increased focus on the way we operate
today. Together with our brands, we seek to build a sustainability culture that will encourage us all to think bigger,
go further and be better.

Sustainability is an integral part of our growth strategy. We are determined to pursue growth in a sustainability
conscious manner. We believe we can do this by integrating sustainability into our operations, from design to supply


-----

chain to sales. Our updated sustainability strategy guides this commitment and supports our vision to become a
global leader in premium sports and outdoor brands. Our management oversees the implementation of our
sustainability strategy. Cross-functional operational teams drive our efforts on sustainable business practices, led by
the Amer Sports platform with participation across key brands and functions. Working groups plan and execute
roadmaps on sustainability initiatives in key areas identified, such as climate change, circular economy, responsible
procurement and supply chain, human rights, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also perform or commission
third-party audits, where applicable, including to monitor sourcing partners in their compliance with industry
standards, regulations and our own expectations regarding sustainability.

We strive to continuously improve our reporting and transparency. Our sustainability framework was created in

reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and CDP frameworks. In line with
guidance provided by the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), we have identified
three key priorities: climate change, circularity and sustainable procurement.

  - We have committed to set science-based near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets at the group
level, which we intend to submit to be validated by the SBTi. Further, Arc’teryx and Salomon have each set
brand-level near-term science-based emission reduction targets for 2030 approved by the SBTi. In addition
to the net zero 2050 target, the SBTs are expected to include existing targets of reaching 100% of our
electricity consumption produced with renewable energy by the end of 2027, and 50% of the purchase
volume from our tier 1 and 2 suppliers produced with renewable electricity by the end of 2030.

  - We are committed to circularity in the design and creation of our products which we believe are built to last
and easy to repair, refurbish, or resell. We are also actively exploring new business models and services
such as Arc’teryx ReBird™ and Peak Performance WearAgains and sharing best practices across the
group.

  - To promote social sustainability in our supply chain, we expect all our tier 1 suppliers to sign the Amer
Sports Ethical Policy, our supplier code of conduct. Our policy is aligned with the FLA Code of Conduct,
and addresses employment relationships, child labor, forced labor, harassment and abuse, discrimination,
compensation, working hours, and health and safety. We expect that our tier 1 suppliers and nominated tier
2 suppliers will have also conducted social compliance training and annual audits reflecting FLA standards
by 2025 in accordance with our contractual requirements.

We are also focused on sustainable business practices at the brand level. For example, Arc’teryx opened five

new ReBird™ Service Centers in the United States, Canada, Greater China and Japan. ReBird™ Service Centers
offer consumers complementary repair services for their Arc’teryx gear, connecting consumers to the brand’s
ongoing focus on improving circularity (which promotes the turning of used products into materials for
new/repurposed products or otherwise extending such products’ lifespans, as opposed to a linear consumption model
where such original products often end up disposed of and treated as “waste”), including upcycling, resale, care and
repair. Arc’teryx’s sustainability program, ReCare™, provides consumers with information on home care and field
repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and
coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform.
Salomon and Peak Performance have reduced the need for materials and transport by using 3D product samples for
sales purposes and is looking to expand the use of 3D in consumer experience and e-commerce. Peak Performance’s
second-hand initiative, WearAgains, offers consumers a platform where they can buy and sell pre-owned Peak
Performance products, either in-store or on our online marketplace. Salomon developed the ground-breaking Index
0.1 shoe with a differentiated thermoplastic polyurethane outsole which significantly reduces greenhouse gas
emissions in manufacturing and is designed to be recyclable into ski boot shells. Salomon has renewed its MTN ski
touring range to reduce its impact on the environment—with products now produced also with up to 30% biosourced or recycled materials, and the brand’s ADDIKT PRO on-piste ski line is made with recycled ABS sidewalls.
In addition, our ski factory in Altenmarkt, Austria drives continued energy efficiency improvements by using local
wood chips instead of oil to heat the factory, resulting in a 95% carbon footprint reduction from heating as
calculated by a lifecycle assessment using GaBi Databases.

We intend to further strengthen our organization and improve our processes, the transparency of our

communication, and the scope, reliability, and depth of our data disclosure to be able to meet or exceed our targets.
While we recognize the challenge of growing the business without growing the environmental and social impacts,
we believe that our strategy, actions and measures can support our journey to sustainable growth. We plan to


-----

achieve it together with our differentiated portfolio of leading brands and the many talented people across the global
Amer Sports community.

**Supply Chain**

Our supply chain is built on the belief that premium products require thoughtful craftsmanship. Our global

supply chain organization is responsible for the operational planning, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of
products to our customers. We pride ourselves on delivering high-quality apparel, footwear, equipment, protective
gear and accessories to our global community of consumers, while working to maintain high standards for labor
practices and workplace conditions and decrease the environmental impact of our supply chain.

**_Sourcing and Manufacturing_**

We believe the combination of our owned and sourced manufacturing across different geographic regions

provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product procurement. Since our ownership transition in 2019, we
have adapted our sourcing practices and supply chain to align with our brand-direct operating model, optimizing our
supply chain to provide our brands with a higher degree of autonomy over their individual sourcing and supply
chain needs. Sourcing, including vendor selection, is now carried out at the brand level, enabling our brands to be
more nimble in their supply chain decision-making. In order to maintain the synergistic benefits of the group’s scale
and consistency to group strategy and standards, back-office services, sustainability, oversight, compliance and
quality control continue to be carried out by the group’s global sourcing team, including relevant human resources,
finance and IT services. To further leverage our diversified setup and scale, we develop and facilitate
communications across all brands, in the areas of quality control, sustainability, supply chain management and
materials sourcing. This dynamic allows us to have oversight over the various brands, promoting and managing
adherence to our Code of Conduct and Ethical Policy, while realizing cost savings from both a scale and operational
perspective.

In 2022, approximately 81% of our products were sourced from a network of third-party strategic suppliers,

with approximately 60% of such products sourced from Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China), approximately 36%
from Greater China, approximately 2% from EMEA, and approximately 2% from the Americas. We have a
diversified sourcing network, with no single tier 1 supplier accounting for more than 20% of total supply in 2022.
Our sourced manufacturing agreements are generally on a fixed price purchase order basis which renew annually.

Several of our hard goods products, such as ski boots and bindings, baseballs bats and baseballs, are produced at

owned manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Europe. We source the raw materials for our owned
manufacturing on generally the same terms as our contracts with sourced manufacturers. We have multiple sources
for most of our materials and components of our products, but rely on a small number of sole source suppliers, such
as for Gore-Tex, which is used in our Arc’teryx, Salomon, Peak Performance and Atomic products. Key raw
materials used in our supply chain include synthetic fabrics and natural products, including blend fabrics, nylon,
polyester, down and cotton, as well as plastics, rubber, carbon and metals.

In making decisions about the location of suppliers and manufacturing operations, we consider a number of

factors including the raw material source, the final destination, production lead times, transport lead times, labor
cost, product complexity, the ability to pursue upside demand, as well as geopolitical risks and developments related
to duties, tariffs and quotas. We also seek out alternative suppliers and manufacturers in order to manage
concentration risk and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions. Where possible, we use at least two
suppliers for a given product to reduce supply risk and to promote competition among suppliers on the basis of cost
and quality.

In peak seasons, our supply chain operations employ approximately 4,400 employees, including approximately

900 contract workers. As many of our brands are shifting quickly to a higher DTC mix, the agility and speed of our
supply chain has become an increasingly important competitive factor to our business, as we are more often
becoming the final step between our products and the end consumer.

**_Distribution_**

Products are shipped from our owned and sourced manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the

world. Our extensive distribution network, consisting of third-party as well as Amer Sports owned and leased
distribution centers, is shared between the brands, allowing each of them to leverage warehouses globally that


-----

processed close to 4 million outbound deliveries and more than 14 million outbound lines in 2022. We directly
operate 9 of our 19 distribution centers, and we carefully determine the remaining third-party contracted centers
depending on our presence in the region. Our distribution centers are strategically located to provide speed and
service to our consumers at efficient costs and supported by a transportation network built on a set of core-carriers
for sea, land and air-transport, under defined service-level agreements. In 2022, we shipped almost 90 million
outbound units and more than 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (“TEUs”) of sea freight. We believe that the
benefits from operating our supply chain on a group level, as opposed to the brand level, deliver significant cost
savings while maintaining high service levels.

**Marketing**

Our brands’ advertising and marketing functions focus on differentiating their individual positioning and

highlighting product qualities, while creating globally unified messaging with appropriate regional nuances in order
to maximize brand recognition, and drive demand from initial end consumer awareness to long-term loyalty. Our
brands are continuing to develop integrated, multi-channel marketing strategies designed to effectively reach their
target consumers. Each brand pursues this strategy through the use of a variety of media channels, including both
traditional media channels as well as digital media channels such as display, online video, social media, paid search
and influencers, along with engagement with brand ambassadors, including partnerships with professional athletes
and professional sports leagues. Our brands also pursue a variety of “grass roots” initiatives to build community
engagement leading to interest and word-of-mouth marketing.

In addition, by leveraging insights across product offerings, we seek to understand how consumer behavior and

expectations are changing. Our brands employ marketing analytics to optimize the impact of advertising and
promotional spending and continuously evolve their brand messaging to ensure that they drive relevance with
consumers. Certain brands also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with wholesale partners
in traditional and digital, including by providing advertising support in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage
to enhance the presentation and brand image of products. Our brand websites are also designed to enhance consumer
understanding of their product offering and help consumers find and buy our products. Each brand employs a
support team that is responsible for customer service at the consumer level as well as a sales force that manages our
customer relationships.

**Technology Infrastructure**

We have invested in establishing a shared IT infrastructure and platform architecture, supported by a centrally

managed IT organization with teams in all brand locations. This group architecture supports robust and scalable IT
operations, is designed to ensure security and compliance and is the foundation for efficient group services including
finance, tax, customs and supply chain. This architecture further supports the implementation of brand specific
business strategies and processes, allowing brand-dedicated applications and solutions directly managed by brand IT
teams to be integrated, while still benefitting from the overall group IT infrastructure. Our enterprise architecture is
built around a global SAP ERP system, providing a scalable digital core as a system-of-record for finance, sales,
inventory and purchasing. We are currently in the process of upgrading this platform across our segments.

**Competition**

The markets in the sports and outdoor industry are highly competitive and fragmented. They include increasing

competition from established companies who are expanding their production and marketing of performance
products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. Given the breadth of our portfolio and global
footprint, we compete with a broad set of competitors that include Moncler, Canada Goose, Lululemon Athletica,
On Running, Hoka, The North Face, and Babolat, in their respective categories.

Competition in the sports and outdoor industry is principally centered on the basis of brand image and

recognition, product quality, innovation, design, sustainability, distribution and price. We believe that we
successfully compete on the basis of premium products and our clear focus on the consumer, as well as our technical
innovation. See “Risk Factors” for additional information on our competitive risks.

**People and Culture**

Amer Sports employees share a passion for sports. We believe our people’s connection to sporting and outdoor

activities is a key benefit to our business as we understand the needs of consumers and athletes globally, which in
turn helps drive a performance-driven, winning culture.

Our strategy as it relates to human resources and relationships with our employees, which we refer to as our

“People Vision,” is to attract and unite some of the best consumer-minded people in the sports and outdoor industry.
Our People Vision focuses on three pillars:

  - Best people: building high-quality leadership and capabilities to execute our business strategy.

  - Great engagement: fostering strong engagement and a great employee experience through clear purpose
and values, a dynamic feedback culture enabled by an advanced survey system, strong development
programs and opportunities.

  - Superior performance: as a result of the above, combined with competitive rewards and a strong focus on
productivity. A passionate and performance-driven culture is our strength and creates attractive
development opportunities for our people and our business.

**_Human Resources_**

Our human resources function follows our brand-direct operating model, whereby the brands have autonomy to

drive their individual resource plans in alignment with their brand strategies. The brand-level functions are
supported by a group-level human resources function in order to provide technological and capability program scale
and efficiency, reporting capabilities and overall governance, such as compensation framework and plans. The
brands also benefit from shared human resources services across all regions, which allow them to operate efficiently
across the world and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and with operational activities such as
payroll administration.

**_Capability and Culture_**

In recent years, Amer Sports has focused on capability building across the group. During the COVID-19

pandemic, Amer Sports began an internal restructuring process that included strategically reallocating existing and
hiring new employees to support focus areas, such as our DTC channel and expansion in China. Our capability and
resource planning is based on an annual people process called Strategy, Structure and Capability Review (SSCR)
where we review and ensure sufficient capabilities across our brands and group functions to execute our short- and
long-term strategic plans. We align the development ambition of our people with execution of our growth strategy.
In addition, over one third of our top 130 executives were hired externally since 2021 to achieve our high-ambition
growth strategy. We have also sought to strengthen capability throughout the group across levels in our brands and
functions with over 2000 new hires in the past two years. In addition, we have made significant efforts to facilitate
learning and development across the company, including through a modern learning management system and
leadership development programs within our brands, as well as a group-wide Leadership Academy that we expect to
be implemented in 2024. We are committed to providing opportunities for the continuous development and learning
of all our people.

We believe that engagement needs to be built on a strong understanding and commitment to a shared purpose

and values, which we are renewing across our global organization. In 2022, we acquired a state-of- the-art employee
engagement survey platform that allows us to regularly and flexibly survey engagement and understand gaps to
address them in a systematic way based on scientifically tested drivers of engagement, inclusion and well-being. We
strive to provide a workplace that is inclusive, engaging and gives opportunities for growth.

We are committed to continuing to promote diversity in the workplace which reflects the global environment in

which we operate. Through our ongoing encouragement of a workplace environment where diversity and inclusion
are valued, we believe we better serve our consumers and our organization. We continue to believe that different
ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds create a stronger and healthier culture and contribute to superior performance.

We are also committed to creating an ethical workplace and community, and we always strive to improve. All

of our employees are trained in and subject to our company Code of Conduct, which describes how we all put our


-----

values into practice every day and sets the standard for the conduct expected by all Amer Sports employees. Further,
we expect our whole value chain, from our own operations to our sourcing partners, to adhere to international
standards for human and labor rights. We have been a member of the internationally recognized FLA since June
2020, and our vendor sustainability team monitors the labor practices of our Tier 1 suppliers seeking to ensure they
meet the requirements set out in our Ethical Policy.

**_Employees_**

As of September 30, 2023, we employ more than 10,800 people across approximately 370 locations and in 41
countries across our three segments. Of our employees, approximately 4,500 full-time employees were based in
EMEA, approximately 3,700 full-time employees were based in the Americas, approximately 800 full-time
employees were based in Greater China and approximately 700 full-time employees were based either in the rest of
Asia Pacific or in other locations. The brands are supported by corporate functions, with approximately 200
employees dedicated at the headquarter level.

We are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in EMEA, the Americas, Greater China, and
the rest of Asia Pacific. Approximately 3,000 of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by
collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good and we have not experienced any
work stoppages.

**Intellectual Property**

Our long-term commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our
intellectual property rights in our brands, designs, technologies, proprietary information and processes, preserve the
confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating
the intellectual property rights of third parties and prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our investment in the development of our
brands, designs, technologies, proprietary information and processes, and trade secrets by relying on a combination
of patent, trademark, copyright, design, and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and
contractual provisions.

We rely on our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain
brand loyalty and recognition. As of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 6,175 trademark registrations,
and approximately 444 trademark applications, across over 120 different jurisdictions, including the United States,
the EU, the PRC, Japan and other major markets. These trademarks include, among others, our principal brands of
Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson, Peak Performance, Atomic, ENVE, Armada, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini and
EvoShield, and their related logos. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of
time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, comply with all applicable
renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar
goods and services. In addition to our trademarks, as of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 887 domain
[name registrations, including Arcteryx.com, Salomon.com, Wilson.com, Peakperformance.com, Atomic.com,](https://arcteryx.com/)
[Enve.com, Armadaskis.com, Slugger.com, Demarini.com and EvoShield.com. However, despite our efforts to](https://enve.com/)
obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our trademarks, there can be no assurance that these protections will be
available in all cases, and our trademarks may be challenged, infringed, misappropriated, circumvented, otherwise
violated, declared generic, determined to be dilutive of or infringing on other trademarks or may lapse. The
occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limit our ability to market our
brands, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar products or
technologies.

As of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 480 issued U.S. patents (including design patents), 83
pending U.S. patent applications (including design applications), 672 issued foreign patents (including design
registrations), 136 pending foreign patent applications (including design applications) and 142 pending PCT
applications relating to technologies, components, materials, features, functionality, and industrial and aesthetic
designs used in and for the manufacture of various of our products.

The term of individual patents and design registrations depends upon the legal term for patents and design
registrations in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent
term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable
country. In the United States, the term of a design patent is 15 years from the date of grant of the patent, and the


-----

term of a similar design registration in foreign jurisdictions may vary. Additionally, in the United States, a patent’s
term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for
administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent. It may
also be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common
inventor and having an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have
filed or may file in the future will result in issued patents in any jurisdiction, and we can give no assurance that any
patents that have been issued or might be issued in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide
us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.

We seek to control access to and use of our designs, technologies, trade secrets, proprietary information and

processes, and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, and through the
inclusion of contractual protections in agreements with employees, contractors, customers and partners. While we
seek to enter into confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and non-compete agreements, as applicable, with
our employees, contractors and other third parties, we may fail to enter into such agreements with all relevant
parties, such agreements may not be self-executing, may be breached, and might not be completely enforceable. As
a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Moreover, we may be subject to claims that
such parties have misappropriated the trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former
employers or other third parties.

For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors— Risks Related

to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology.”

-----

the Americas, EMEA, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific regions, as of September 30, 2023. Owned retail
stores are generally leased under operating leases and include renewal options.

We consider the facilities that we use in our business to be suitable and adequate for the purposes for which

they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative
facilities. We are committed to maintaining all of these properties in good operating condition.

**Regulatory Matters**

In the United States, EU and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to, laws governing

advertising and product labeling, environmental, health and safety, ESG laws and regulations, data privacy and
security laws, rules and regulations, antitrust and competition laws and labor and employment laws, among others.
Our products, which are predominantly manufactured in countries other than the United States and which are
shipped into over 100 countries across the world, may be subject to tariffs, treaties, and various trade agreements, as
well as laws affecting the importation of consumer goods. It is our policy and practice to comply with all
government regulations applicable to our business. The process of complying with applicable federal, state and local
regulations in the United States and around the world may be complex, time consuming and costly. In addition, the
global regulatory landscape is subject to rapid and unexpected changes, some driven by geo-political influences, and
there has been a general trend toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement around the world in recent
years. New or more stringent laws or regulations, more restrictive interpretations of existing laws or regulations,
court practices or increased enforcement actions by governmental and regulatory agencies around the world could
increase our ongoing costs of compliance, alter the environment in which we do business or otherwise adversely
affect our business. If we fail to comply with any new or existing laws or regulations, we may be required to pay
damages, cease advertising or promotional activities, alter our products or marketing materials, cease selling certain
products and possibly face fines, corrective measures or other types of sanctions. Furthermore, as we continue to
expand our global operations, we may be required to comply with market-specific laws and regulations, including
by obtaining approvals, licenses or certifications from a particular country’s regulators. Failure to obtain these
approvals, licenses or certifications or comply with these laws or regulations could impede our growth prospects and
otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For additional information about
risks associated with government regulations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation.”

**_Advertising and Labeling_**

The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising

as well as relationships between us, on the one hand, and advertisers and influencers, on the other hand, pursuant to
principles described in the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (the
“Endorsement Guides”). The Endorsement Guides provide that an endorsement should reflect the honest opinion of
the endorser and cannot be used to make a claim about a product that the product’s marketer could not itself legally
make. The Endorsement Guides also stipulate that, if there is a connection between an endorser and the marketer
that consumers would not expect and this connection would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, then
that connection should be disclosed. Although the Endorsement Guides are advisory in nature and do not operate
directly with the force of law, they provide guidance about what the FTC staff generally believes the Federal Trade
Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) requires in the context of using endorsements and testimonials in advertising. Any
practices inconsistent with the Endorsement Guides can result in violations of the FTC Act’s proscription against
unfair and deceptive practices. If our advertising claims or claims made by our social media influencers or by other
endorsers with whom we have a material connection do not comply with the Endorsement Guides or any
requirements of the FTC Act or similar state requirements, then the FTC and state authorities could subject us to
investigations and enforcement actions, impose penalties, require us to pay monetary consumer redress, require us to
revise our marketing materials or require us to accept burdensome injunctions, any of which could adversely affect
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Furthermore, the National Advertising Division (“NAD”) of the Better Business Bureau administers a self
regulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising. NAD monitors
national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competitors and consumers. We may also be
subject to various state consumer protection laws, including California’s Proposition 65, which requires a specific
warning on any product that contains a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth
defects, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.


-----

Many countries and markets outside the United States have similar, and sometimes more stringent, regulations

of advertising practices. For example, in the European Union, advertising of products is subject both to general
consumer advertising requirements pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC),
which imposes a general prohibition on misleading and aggressive advertising and in the PRC, the Advertising Law
regulates advertising and puts similar restrictions on such activities.

**_Environmental, Health and Safety_**

Federal, state and local authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities around the world,

enforce a broad range of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we and
our third party suppliers manufacture and sell our products or otherwise operate our business. These include
requirements governing product content and labeling, worker health and safety, the handling, manufacture,
transportation, storage, use and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials and wastes, the discharge and
emission of pollutants and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. We could incur substantial costs,
including civil or criminal fines or penalties, enforcement actions and other third-party claims and cleanup costs as a
result of our failure to comply with, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations or permits required thereunder.
Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be subject to liability for environmental investigations
and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste
we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or the relevant conduct was legal at the
time it occurred. We are addressing contamination from historical operations in the United States that has been
identified at certain of our current or former properties. The ultimate cost at such sites is difficult to accurately
predict and we may incur significant additional costs as a result of the discovery of contamination or the imposition
of additional obligations (including in connection with expansions or renovations of our facilities) at these or other
sites in the future.

We also are subject to extensive and evolving regulations regarding the manufacturing, processing, distribution,

importing, exporting and labeling of our products and their raw materials. In the European Union, the Registration,
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations came into effect in 2007, with
implementation rolling out over time. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential
restrictions. Since the promulgation of REACH, other countries have enacted or are in the process of implementing
similar comprehensive chemical regulations. In addition, California’s Proposition 65 requires companies to place
warnings on products sold in California that contain one of approximately 900 chemicals known to the state of
California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. The California state attorney general, as well as
private citizens, can file lawsuits against companies for alleged failure to comply with Proposition 65; from time to
time, we have received such lawsuits regarding certain of our products.

Our operations are also subject to regulation in the United States under federal, state and local occupational

health and safety standards, as well as occupational health and safety standards applicable to our operations in other
jurisdictions. These standards establish certain employer responsibilities, including requirements to maintain a
workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause serious injury or death, certain medical and hygiene standards,
licensing and permitting obligations and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Our
facilities and operations may be subject to periodic inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration representatives and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with applicable
occupational health and safety standards, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, could result in civil
or criminal enforcement and substantial penalties, significant capital expenditures or suspension or limitation of our
operations.

**_ESG_**

Federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have adopted or proposed, and are likely to

continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the management of sustainability- or ESGrelated topics, or disclosures on such matters. For example, we may be subject to the disclosure requirements of the
EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (and its implementing laws and regulations) and other EU
directives or EU and EU member state regulations, the International Sustainability Standards Board’s sustainability
and climate disclosure standards, various disclosure requirements (such as greenhouse gas metrics, climate risks, use
of offsets, and emissions reduction claims) from the State of California as well as the SEC’s climate disclosure
proposal, if finalized, among other regulations or requirements; these regulations and requirements may not entirely
align and thus require us to duplicate certain or make different efforts or use different reporting methodologies in


-----

order to comply with each jurisdictions’ requirements. Separately, various regulators have adopted, or are
considering adopting, regulations on environmental marketing claims, including but not limited to the use of
“sustainable,” “eco-friendly,” “organic,” “recyclable” or similar language in product marketing. There are also
increasing regulations on the provenance, composition, or production methods of products to reflect environmental
and/or social concerns, which may require us to change our suppliers, disrupt our business operations, incur
additional compliance costs or otherwise impact our reputation, operations or financial condition.

**_Data Privacy and Security_**

We are subject to increasingly complex and changing laws, directives, industry standards, rules and regulations,

as well as contractual obligations, related to data privacy and security in the United States and around the world that
impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, transmission, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality,
security, retention, availability, integrity and other processing of personal information.

In the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the FTC, have

adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, rules and regulations concerning personal information and information
security and have prioritized privacy and information security violations for enforcement actions. Certain state laws
may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information
than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may
complicate compliance efforts. For example, we are subject to the CCPA, which imposes obligations on covered
companies that process the personal information of California residents. Among other things, the CCPA requires
covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California residents regarding data privacy and security, and
provides California residents with data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt out of the sale or
certain sharing of their personal information, and to request the deletion of their personal information (subject to
certain exceptions). The CCPA provides a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of
personal information as well as for civil penalties with enforcement capabilities for both the California Attorney
General and a new state agency created under the CPRA. The enactment of the CCPA and other state privacy, data
protection and cybersecurity laws, rules and regulations is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in
other states in the United States, which creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws.
For example, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), which became effective on
January 1, 2023, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), which became effective on July 1, 2023, and
Connecticut enacted the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), which became effective on July 1, 2023. The
VCDPA, the CPA and the CTDPA have some similarities to the CCPA and introduced new data privacy rights for
residents of such states and new operational requirements for covered companies, including consent requirements
for the collection of sensitive personal information. At least nine additional states (Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee,
Montana, Delaware, Oregon, Texas and Florida) have passed similar laws, with some scheduled to take effect in
2023 and others in subsequent years, and other states are considering enacting similar such laws. In addition, laws in
all 50 states in the United States require businesses to provide notice to consumers (and, in some cases, to
regulators) whose personal information has been accessed or acquired as a result of a data breach. State laws are
changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data protection law to which
we would become subject if it is enacted.

We are also subject to international laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, which apply

broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information.
For example, in the EEA, we are subject to the EU GDPR and, following the UK’s exit from the EU, we are subject
in the UK to the UK GDPR. The EU GDPR and UK GDPR impose strict compliance obligations with respect to our
ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal information, including a
principal of accountability, the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and
audits, and the requirement to appoint data protection officers when special categories of personal information, such
as health data, are processed on a large scale. Non-compliance with the EU GDPR and UK GDPR may lead to fines
for certain violations of up to €20 million or £17.5 million, respectively, or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover
of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. However, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate
future changes to be made to the EU GDPR (such changes would need to be specifically incorporated by the UK
government), which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. On June 28, 2021, the
European Commission announced an adequacy decision concluding that the UK ensures an equivalent level of data
protection to the EU GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal information
flows from the EEA to the UK. This adequacy determination will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the
European Commission renews or extends it and it may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot predict


-----

how the UK GDPR and other UK privacy and information security laws, rules or regulations may develop, including
as compared to the EU GDPR, nor can we predict the effects of divergent laws and related guidance. Moreover, the
UK is currently in the process of reforming its data protection framework. This may lead to future divergence and
variance between the two regimes.

The EU GDPR and UK GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal information to countries

outside of the EEA and the UK. Legal developments in Europe have created further complexity and uncertainty
regarding such transfers, in particular in relation to transfers to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of
Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield,
under which personal information could be transferred from the EEA (and the UK) to relevant self-certified United
States entities. The CJEU further noted that reliance on the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract
approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism and potential
alternative to the Privacy Shield) alone for transfers of personal information outside the EEA (and the UK) may not
necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances, and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. On July
10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (the
“EU-US DPF”) (a new framework for transferring personal information from the EEA to the United States), having
determined that the EU-US DPF ensures that the protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the
United States will be comparable to the protection offered in the EU. However, this decision will likely face legal
challenges and ultimately may be invalidated by the CJEU just as the Privacy Shield was. In addition, on October
12, 2023, the UK-US Data Bridge went into effect to operate as an extension of the EU-US DPF to enable the
transfer of personal data between the UK and certified entities in the United States. Such Data Bridge could not only
be challenged, but also may be affected by any challenges to the EU-US DPF. As a result of changes in the laws,
rules and regulations governing cross-border transfers of personal information, we have had to make, and continue
to make, certain operational changes, conduct assessments of our data transfer policies and procedures, and update
and implement revised standard contractual clauses and other relevant documentation and measures for intragroup,
customer and vendor arrangements requiring transfers of personal information outside the EEA and the UK,
including to the United States, within required time frames. We may be adversely impacted as the enforcement
landscape further develops, and supervisory authorities issue further guidance on international data transfers.

Moreover, in the EEA and the UK, national laws transposing the ePrivacy Directive require opt-in consent to

place non-essential cookies or tracking technologies on an individual’s device and for direct electronic marketing. In
the EEA and the UK, consent must be obtained in accordance with the requirements of the EU GDPR and the UK
GDPR, respectively. These requirements include a prohibition on using pre-checked boxes and a requirement to
ensure separate consents are sought for each type of non-essential cookie or tracking technology. Recent EEA court
and regulatory decisions are driving increased attention on cookies and tracking technologies. For example,
regulators and courts are increasingly active as a result of actions by NOYB (a not-for-profit privacy activist group),
that has issued over 700 draft complaints to European website operators regarding their cookie banners and
subsequently referred over 650 complaints to relevant national regulators, noting it aims to seek enforcement on up
to 10,000 websites in Europe.

In addition to the data protection laws in the United States, the EEA, the UK and various other jurisdictions in

which operate, we are also subject to the PRC’s data protection laws. Under the PRC’s Cybersecurity Law, any
collection, use, transfer or storage of personal information of an individual through a network by the network
operator should be based on the three principles of legitimacy, justification and necessity and requires the consent of
the data subject. The rules, purposes, methods and ranges of such collection should also be disclosed to the data
subject. The PRC’s Cybersecurity Law requires operators of CIIOs to store personal information and important data
collected and generated from the critical information infrastructure within the PRC. On September 14, 2022, CAC,
the PRC’s top cybersecurity regulator, released new amendments to the PRC’s Cybersecurity Law for public
consultation and if the amendments are passed, the amended law will increase the penalties for violations of
cybersecurity obligations under the Cybersecurity Law, in line with those under the Data Security Law and PIPL.

Building on this, the PRC’s Data Security Law became effective on September 1, 2021. The primary purpose of

the Data Security Law is to regulate data activities, safeguard data security, promote data development and usage,
protect individuals and entities’ legitimate rights and interests, and safeguard state sovereignty, state security and
development interests. The Data Security Law applies extraterritorially, and to a broad range of activities that
involve “data” (not only personal or sensitive data). Under the Data Security Law, entities and individuals carrying
out data activities must abide by various data security obligations. For example, the Data Security Law proposes to
classify and protect data based on the importance of data to the state’s economic development, as well as the degree


-----

of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or
organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, or illegally acquired or used. The appropriate
level of protective measures is required to be taken for each respective class of data. The Data Security Law also
echoes the data localization requirement in the Cybersecurity Law and requires important data to be stored locally in
the PRC. Such important data may only be transferred outside of the PRC subject to compliance with certain data
transfer restrictions, such as passing a security assessment organized by the relevant authorities.

Additionally, on August 20, 2021, the PRC announced the PIPL, which took effect on November 1, 2021. The

PIPL is intended to clarify the scope of application, the definitions of personal information and sensitive personal
information, the legality of personal information processing and the basic requirements of notice and consent,
among other things. The PIPL also sets out data localization requirements for CIIOs and personal information
handlers who process personal information above a certain threshold prescribed by the relevant authorities. The
PIPL also includes a list of rules which must be complied with prior to the transfer of personal information outside
of the PRC, such as compliance with a security assessment or certification by an agency designated by the relevant
authorities or entering into standard form model contracts approved by the relevant authorities with the overseas
recipient. Notably, the PIPL, similar to the EU GDPR, applies extraterritorially.

On July 7, 2022, the CAC issued Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Data Transfers, which became

effective on September 1, 2022. The Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Data Transfers clarifies the
security assessment requirement under the PIPL and requires a data handler to apply for the security assessment
organized by the CAC under any of the following circumstances before the information is transferred outbound: (i)
where a data handler provides important data overseas, (ii) critical information infrastructure operator and personal
information handlers who process more than 1 million individuals’ personal information; (iii) where a data handler
has cumulatively provided personal information of over 100,000 individuals or sensitive personal information of
over 10,000 individuals in total abroad since January 1 of the previous year. Additionally, on November 18, 2022,
the CAC and the State Administration of Market Regulation issued the Implementation Rules for Personal
Information Protection Certification which apply with immediate effect and which provide important guidance on
obtaining a personal information certification for lawful cross-border transfer of personal information under the
PIPL. The CAC published the Measures on Standard Contract for Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information,
which became effective on June 1, 2023, and the Guidelines on Filing the Standard Contract for the Export of
Personal Information on February 24, 2023 and May 30, 2023, respectively. These provide important guidance on
relying on the standard contract for transferring personal information out of the PRC and on its filing requirement.
As a result of changes in the cross-border data transfer landscape, we have had to and continue to review our
existing data protection compliance framework, conduct data mapping exercises, obtain relevant separate consents
from individuals, apply for a security assessment with the CAC and enter into standard contracts with our overseas
affiliates for transfers of personal information outside of the PRC.

In addition to the PRC’s Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law and the PIPL, the relevant government

authorities of the PRC promulgated several regulations or released a number of draft regulations for public
comments which are designed to provide further implemental guidance in accordance with the laws mentioned
above. We cannot predict what impact the new laws and regulations or the increased costs of compliance, if any,
will have on our operations in the PRC, in particular the Data Security Law or PIPL, or the increased costs of
compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the PRC due to their recent enactment and the limited guidance
available, particularly on PIPL, which entities are awaiting further guidance on, particularly on the scope of data
localization requirement. It is also generally unclear how the laws will be interpreted and enforced in practice by the
relevant government authorities.

Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or

criminal penalties and private litigation. Data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations are
constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in
investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on our ability to process data.
For additional information about the risks to our business associated with data privacy and security matters, see
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology—We are subject to various
laws, rules, regulations and guidelines relating to data privacy and security governing the use and processing of
personal information. Changes in such laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, or any actual or perceived failure by
us to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy
and security, could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include administrative fines, civil or
criminal penalties, suspension of processing activities and audits), private litigation or adverse publicity, any of


-----

which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.”

**_Anti-Corruption_**

We are subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in countries outside of the United

States in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act and PRC anti-corruption laws. These laws and regulations
are aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt behavior. Anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws have been enforced
aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their
third-party intermediaries from corruptly promising, offering, authorizing, or providing, directly or indirectly,
anything of value to government officials, political parties, and private sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining
or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any other improper business advantage. The
FCPA also requires U.S. issuers to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation—Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws
could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.”

**_Other Regulations_**

We are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations in the United States and around the world. For

example, we must comply with an increasing number of laws designed to combat abuses of human rights in supply
chain operations, such as the UFLPA. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities
in the United States and around the world. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United States
(including those imposed by OFAC) and other authorities that may prohibit us or our affiliates from doing business
in certain countries or restrict the type of business that may be conducted by us or our affiliates. For example,
actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War have included the imposition of export controls and broad
financial and economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine. Enforcement activities
under these laws and regulations could subject us to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions,
which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions and administrative remedies.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of

business, including proceedings to maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We have received,
and may in the future receive claims relating to intellectual property, commercial contracts, product liability,
marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, labor and employment, data
privacy and security, environmental, health and safety and tax matters. The results of any current or future litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us
because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, harm to our brands and reputation, and
other factors. We are not currently party to any legal proceedings the resolution of which we believe would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

shares, it shall have the right to nominate a total of one ANTA Director. At the time ANTA Sports and its affiliates
together beneficially hold less than 10% of our then-outstanding ordinary shares, it shall no longer have the right to
nominate for election any ANTA Director.

**Board Nomination Agreement**

In connection with the Amer Sports IPO, we have entered into a new Board Nomination Agreement with

Anamered, which has become effective as of the closing of the Amer Sports IPO (the “Nomination Agreement”).

Pursuant to the Nomination Agreement, we have agreed that, for so long as Anamered and its affiliates together

continue to beneficially hold at least 10% of our then-outstanding ordinary shares, it shall have the right to nominate
a total of one candidate to serve as a director (the “Anamered Director”). At the time Anamered and its affiliates
together beneficially hold less than 10% of our then-outstanding ordinary shares, it shall no longer have the right to
nominate for election any Anamered Director.

**Indemnification Agreements**

We expect to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and directors that

provide, in general, that we will indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by law in connection with their
service to us or on our behalf.

**Policy on Related Person Transactions**

In connection with the Amer Sports IPO, we have adopted a new related person transaction policy. Our related

person transaction policy states that any related person transaction must be approved or ratified by our audit
committee or board of directors. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction with a related person, our


-----

audit committee or board of directors will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including, without
limitation, the commercial reasonableness of the terms of the transaction, the benefit and perceived benefit, or lack
thereof, to us, the opportunity costs of an alternative transaction, the materiality and character of the related person’s
direct or indirect interest and the actual or apparent conflict of interest of the related person. Our audit committee or
board of directors will not approve or ratify a related person transaction unless it has determined that, upon
consideration of all relevant information, such transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests and the
best interests of our shareholders.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a summary of the material provisions relating to our material indebtedness. The following

summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
provisions of the corresponding agreement or instrument.

**New Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

We intend, in addition to the notes offered hereby, to enter into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”)

providing for a U.S. dollar denominated term loan facility of $600 million with a seven-year term to maturity (the
“New USD Term Loan Facility”), a Euro denominated term loan facility of €600 million with a seven-year term to
maturity (the “New EUR Term Loan Facility,” and together with the New USD Term Loan Facility, the “New Term
Loan Facilities”) and a five-year revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with
the New Term Loan Facilities, the “New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), which will initially be a $710 million
revolving credit facility established under the Credit Agreement, as we will maintain an existing $90 million
bilateral credit facility entered into with Standard Chartered Bank on September 22, 2021. The bilateral facility is
expected to ultimately be consolidated into a single revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with the use of proceeds of the notes offered
hereby, are expected to be used to repay and terminate our outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit
facilities and to finance the working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and

certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company that are organized in the United States, Austria, Canada,
Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Finland, France, Hong Kong and Sweden, subject to certain exceptions. The New
USD Term Loan Facility will be denominated in U.S. dollars, the New EUR Term Loan Facility will be
denominated in Euros and borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be available in U.S. dollars or
Euros.

Borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility in: (i) U.S. dollars will bear interest at a rate per annum

equal to, at our option, either (a) a term SOFR-based rate or (b) a U.S. dollar base rate and (ii) Euros will bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (provided, however, that the term SOFR-based rate and EURIBOR
shall be no less than 0.00% per annum at any time and the U.S. dollar base rate shall be no less than 1.00% per
annum at any time), in each case, plus an applicable margin.

The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be between

0.75% to 1.75% with respect to U.S. dollar base rate borrowings and between 1.75% to 2.75% with respect to SOFR
or EURIBOR borrowings based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio (the “Applicable Rate”). In addition,
we will be required to pay commitment fees equal to 30% of the Applicable Rate then in effect for SOFR
borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, on a per annum basis in respect of the unutilized commitments
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. We will also be required to pay letter of credit
fees on the maximum amount available to be drawn under all outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the
Applicable Rate on SOFR borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility on a per annum basis, payable
quarterly in arrears, as well as customary fronting fees for the issuance of letters of credit and agency fees.

Borrowings under the (i) New USD Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our

option, either (x) a term SOFR-based rate, plus an applicable margin to be set forth in the Credit Agreement or (y) a
U.S. dollar base rate, plus an applicable margin to be set forth in the Credit Agreement and (ii) New EUR Term
Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin to be set forth in
the Credit Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions and customary baskets set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company will be

required to make mandatory prepayments of the loans under the New Term Loan Facilities under certain
circumstances, including from: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of insurance and condemnation proceeds for
property or asset losses (subject to reinvestment rights, decrease based on leverage ratios and net proceeds
threshold), (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of debt (other than permitted debt under the
Credit Agreement), (iii) 50% of excess cash flow subject to decrease based on leverage ratios and subject to a
threshold amount and (iv) 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales (subject to reinvestment rights, decrease based


-----

on leverage ratios and net proceeds threshold). These mandatory prepayments may be used to satisfy future
amortization.

The amortization rate for the New USD Term Loan Facility will be 1.00% per annum, payable in quarterly

installments, and the first installment in respect of the New USD Term Loan Facility will be payable on June 30,
2024. The New EUR Term Loan Facility is not expected to be subject to scheduled amortization payments. The
Company may direct that prepayments be applied to such amortization payments in order of maturity.

We will be permitted to voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving commitment amount and

repay outstanding loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than
customary “breakage” costs with respect to SOFR and EURIBOR loans. We will be permitted to voluntarily repay
outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facilities at any time without premium or penalty; provided that that we
expect that any voluntary prepayment, refinancing or repricing of the New Term Loan Facilities in connection with
certain repricing transactions that occur prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities shall be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loans so
prepaid, refinanced or repriced.

The obligations of the Company and the obligations of the guarantors under the New Senior Secured Credit

Facilities and certain hedging arrangements and cash management arrangements entered into with lenders under the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (or affiliates thereof) will be secured by first-priority security interests in the
collateral securing such facilities subject to certain exclusions set forth in the credit documentation governing the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The Credit Agreement is expected to contain a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to

certain exceptions, restrict the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to:

  - incur additional indebtedness;

  - create liens;

  - enter into agreements and other arrangements that include negative pledge clauses;

  - pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;

  - make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;

  - merge, amalgamate or sell assets, including equity interests of subsidiaries;

  - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

  - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

  - enter into amendments of or waivers under subordinated indebtedness.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will also contain financial covenants that: (1) require the Company to

maintain a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of not greater than 5.00:1.00 and (2) require the Company to
maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.00:1.00, which shall increase to 2.25:1.00 as of the fiscal
quarter ending December 31, 2025 and shall further increase to 2.50:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending December
31, 2026. The financial covenants will contain a customary term loan facility standstill and customary cure rights.

The Credit Agreement will also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. If an

event of default, as specified in the Credit Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the borrowers thereunder may
be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We periodically
review our debt profile with a view towards extending maturities and/or improving the terms of such debt. We may,
from time to time, seek amendments to such debt in order to effect any such changes.

The terms described above with respect to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to change and a

number of conditions, including market conditions. To the extent that any of the conditions with respect to such
indebtedness are not satisfied, such indebtedness may not be available on the terms described herein or at all.


-----

**_Bilateral Facility_**

On January 1, 2021, Amer Sports European Center AG (the “Borrower”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Amer

Sports, Inc., entered into a bilateral loan facility with Standard Chartered Bank authorizing a revolving credit line of
up to $50 million (the “Bilateral Facility”) and, on September 25, 2023, the Bilateral Facility was increased to $90
million. The Bilateral Facility is a short term facility with maximum tenor of twelve months for borrowings
thereunder and bears interest at a rate equal to (i) SOFR plus 2.55% per annum for borrowings in U.S. dollars, (ii)
Euro short-term rate plus 2.50% per annum for borrowings in Euros and (iii) SONIA plus 2.40% per annum for
borrowings in British pounds. Borrowings under the Bilateral Facility are unsecured and guaranteed by Amer Sports
Holding 1 Oy (the “Guarantor”) and the Borrower and Guarantor are subject to certain restrictive covenants.

The Bilateral Facility is expected to ultimately be consolidated with the new $710 million revolving facility

under the Credit Agreement, resulting in a total New Revolving Credit Facility of $800 million.

**Receivables Purchase Agreements**

**_Wells Fargo Receivables Facility_**

On July 15, 2022, Amer Sports US Financing LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amer Sports, Inc. (the “Wells

Fargo Seller”), entered into a receivables purchase agreement (the “Wells Fargo Receivables Purchase Agreement”)
with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Wells Fargo Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Wells Fargo
Seller agreed to sell accounts receivable from time to time so long as the outstanding amount does not exceed $50
million in exchange for advanced funding equal to 100% of the principal value of such receivables on a nonrecourse basis. The Wells Fargo Seller is charged a commission fee of 0.4% based on the gross purchased amount of
receivables, and an adjustment rate equal to SOFR plus 1.50% per annum based on the number of dates between
purchase and settlement. The obligors under the Wells Fargo Receivables Purchase Agreement include, in addition
to the Seller, Amer Sports Winter & Outdoor Company, Wilson Sporting Goods Co. and Amer Sports Company.

The Wells Fargo Receivables Purchase Agreement will initially expire three years from the effective date of

July 15, 2022 and is automatically renewed for additional twelve month-periods following such expiration. The
Wells Fargo Seller and Wells Fargo Purchaser may terminate the agreement upon no less than 60 and no more than
90 days’ notice to the other party, and the Wells Fargo Purchaser may also terminate the agreement upon the
occurrence of certain events and actions by the Wells Fargo Seller.

**_Targobank Receivables Facilities_**

On December 1, 2023 and on December 14, 2023, respectively, Amer Sports Austria GmbH and Amer Sports

Deutschland GmbH (each a “Targobank Seller” and together the “Targobank Sellers”), each entered into a
receivables purchase agreement (each a “Targobank Receivables Purchase Agreement” and together the “Targobank
Receivables Purchase Agreements”) with Targobank AG (the “Targobank Purchaser”) pursuant to which each
Targobank Seller agreed to sell accounts receivable from time to time so long as the aggregate outstanding amount
under the Targobank Receivables Purchase Agreements and a receivables purchase agreement entered into or to be
entered into by Amer Sports France S.A.S as a seller and the Targobank Purchaser as purchaser does not exceed
EUR 60 million in exchange for advanced funding equal to 90% of the principal value of such receivables on a nonrecourse basis. There is no commission payable, and each Targobank Seller is charged an interest rate equal to threemonth EURIBOR plus 2.75% per annum, with EURIBOR floor at 0, based on the number of dates between
purchase and settlement and an audit fee of EUR 5,000 per annum by Amer Sports Deutschland GmbH and EUR
2,500 per annum by Amer Sports Austria GmbH. The security granted by each Targobank Seller to the Targobank
Purchaser under each Targobank Receivables Purchase Agreement includes a pledge over collection accounts of the
Targobank Seller, a security assignment of receivables in case purchase of such receivables was not valid, an
assignment of ancillary rights and claims relating to accounts receivable and an assignment of all insurance claims
from existing credit insurance policy.

Each Targobank Receivables Purchase Agreement will initially expire on November 30, 2025 and is

automatically renewed for additional twelve month-periods following such expiration. Each Targobank Seller and
the Targobank Purchaser may terminate the respective Targobank Receivables Purchase Agreement upon no less
than 60 and no more than 90 days’ notice to the other party, and the Targobank Purchaser may also terminate the
agreement upon the occurrence of certain events and actions by the respective Targobank Seller.


-----

Any receivables sold under any of the Wells Fargo Receivables Purchase Agreement or the Targobank

Receivables Purchase Agreements will not be pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement or in favor of the
notes to be issued hereby.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this section of the offering memorandum under the

subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this section, (i) the term “Issuer” refers only to Amer Sports Company, a
Delaware corporation, and its successors and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the term “Parent” refers only to
Amer Sports, Inc., the Issuer’s ultimate parent and an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the
Cayman Islands, and its successors and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue the     % Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “notes”) under an indenture, to be dated

as of February  , 2024 (the “Issue Date”), among the Issuer, the Note Guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and Wilmington Trust (London) Limited as Notes
Collateral Agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The indenture will not be subject to the provisions
of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Holders of the notes will not be entitled to any registration rights or
similar rights.

The Issuer has the right to issue additional notes in the future. Any such additional notes will have the same

terms as the notes being offered hereby but may be offered at a different offering price or have a different initial
interest payment date than the notes being offered by this offering memorandum. If issued, these additional notes
will become part of the same series as the notes being offered by this offering memorandum.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the

indenture in its entirety. You are urged to read the indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights
as holders of the notes. Copies of the indenture are available as set forth below under “—Additional Information.”

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. The registered holders of the

notes are those that own notes registered in their own names on the books that the Issuer or the Trustee as registrar
maintains for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in the notes registered in street name or in
notes issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. Only registered holders will have rights under the
indenture. Owners of beneficial interests in the notes should read the information contained under the subheading
“—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**Ranking**

The notes and the Note Guarantees of the notes will be:

    - general secured obligations of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors, as applicable, secured by a first
priority Lien on the Collateral referred to below;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with each other and all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness_
of the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor;

    - senior in right of payment to all future indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor that
expressly provides for its subordination to the notes or the applicable Note Guarantee;

    - effectively pari passu with all indebtedness secured by a first-priority Lien on the Collateral (including
the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities);

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, preferred stock and other liabilities of
the Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that do not guarantee the notes; and

    - effectively senior to all existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured of the Issuer or the
applicable Note Guarantor or that is secured by junior Liens, in each case to the extent of the value of
the Collateral.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The Issuer may issue additional notes

under the indenture from time to time after this offering. Any offering of additional notes is subject to the covenants
described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock


-----

or Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” The notes and any additional notes subsequently issued
under the indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided, however, that if any additional notes
are not fungible with the notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes, they will be issued with a
separate CUSIP number. The Issuer will issue the notes in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof. The notes will mature on     , 2031.

Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of     % per annum. Interest on the notes will be payable semi
annually in arrears on      and     , commencing on     , 2024. The Issuer will make each interest payment
to the holders of record on the immediately preceding       and       .

Interest on the notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was

most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Trustee will initially act as registrar, transfer agent and paying agent for the notes. The Issuer may change

the registrar, transfer agent or paying agent without prior notice to the holders, and the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as paying agent, transfer agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. The registrar, the transfer agent and

the paying agent may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents in connection with a transfer of notes.

Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any

note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days
before a selection of notes to be redeemed.

**Note Guarantees**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the indenture initially will be jointly and severally guaranteed by

the Parent and those of the Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that are borrowers or guarantors
under the Credit Agreement. If any such Subsidiary that is organized outside of the United States or Canada is not
able to enter into such Note Guarantee on the Issue Date, the Issuer intends to cause such Subsidiary to provide such
Note Guarantee as promptly as practicable thereafter, and the indenture will require the Issuer to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Note Guarantees to be issued within 120 days after the Issue Date; however, no
assurance can be given that such Note Guarantees will be granted on a timely basis.

Not all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or

reorganization of any of these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (including the Parent’s Subsidiaries that are required to
guarantee the notes but have not yet issued such Note Guarantees), these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the
holders of their debts, preferred stock and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their
assets to the Parent. As of December 31, 2022, these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries represented 23.0% of the
Company’s liabilities, to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated.

If any Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) of the Parent that is not the Issuer nor a Note

Guarantor (i) provides a Guarantee of any Indebtedness of the Parent or is a guarantor under any syndicated Credit
Facility or Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor after the Issue Date, or (ii) becomes a borrower
or a guarantor under the Credit Agreement, such Restricted Subsidiary will promptly execute a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which it will Guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and
the indenture for so long as the Guarantee in connection with the applicable Indebtedness remains in place.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Subsidiary shall be required to Guarantee the notes if any such Guarantee shall be
illegal or unenforceable under relevant law (after taking into account the limitations set forth in the next succeeding
paragraph), as determined in good faith by the Issuer.

The obligations of each Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such

Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or preference under applicable law. In addition, the


-----

obligations of any Note Guarantor organized outside of the United States of America and Canada may be limited as
necessary or appropriate to (1) comply with applicable law, (2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general
statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, “thin capitalization” rules,
retention of title claims or similar matters or (3) avoid a conflict with the fiduciary duties of such company’s
directors, contravention of any legal prohibition or regulatory condition, or the material risk of personal or criminal
liability for any officers or directors (in each case as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion). Such limitations
could be significant and could, depending on the jurisdiction, reduce the obligations of any Note Guarantor
organized outside of the United States of America to zero. In addition, the Credit Agreement grants the
administrative agent under the Credit Agreement the ability to agree to additional limitations on guarantees under
the Credit Agreement in certain circumstances, which if agreed to would also limit the Note Guarantees for so long
as the Credit Agreement remains outstanding. You can find detailed information with respect to limitations on the
validity and enforceability of a Note Guarantee granted by Note Guarantors organized outside of the United States
of America under “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

A Note Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee and its obligations under the

indenture:

(1) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Note Guarantor, by

way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or, except in the case of the Parent, a sale or other
disposition of all of the Equity Interests of such Note Guarantor then held by the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to a transaction not prohibited by the indenture;

(2) if such Note Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted

Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the provisions of the indenture, upon effectiveness of such designation
or when it first ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, respectively, or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary;

(3) in the case of any Note Guarantee issued on the Issue Date (or required but issued thereafter pursuant to the

first paragraph above under the caption “—Note Guarantees”), upon the release or discharge of the Note Guarantee
by such Note Guarantor in respect of the Credit Agreement, and, in any other case, upon the release or discharge of
any Note Guarantee in respect of Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of the Note
Guarantee by such Note Guarantor;

(4) upon the occurrence of a Fall Away Event;

(5) if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described under “—

Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or if the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture are discharged in
accordance with the terms of the indenture; or

(6) as provided in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

**Security for the Notes**

**_General_**

The obligations under the notes will be secured by first priority liens or floating charge (as applicable in the

jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant Note Guarantors) granted by the Issuer, the Note Guarantors and any
future Note Guarantor on substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors (whether now owned
or hereafter arising or acquired), subject to certain exceptions (including with respect to certain assets that will be
subject to a lien securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement but may not secure the notes, as described
below), Permitted Liens and encumbrances described in the indenture and the Collateral Documents.

In the Collateral Documents, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions described below

or as set forth in the Collateral Documents (including certain limitations and exclusions applicable to non-U.S. Note
Guarantors specified in the “Agreed Security Principles” to be set forth in an exhibit to the indenture, in regards to
assets of such non-U.S. Note Guarantors), will grant first priority liens or a floating charge (as applicable in the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant Note Guarantors) in (collectively, excluding the Excluded Assets, the
“Collateral”):


-----

(1) 100% of the Capital Stock of certain existing and future wholly owned material subsidiaries of the Issuer or

any Note Guarantors, subject to certain limitations, including limiting the pledges of voting Capital Stock of certain
Specified Foreign Subsidiaries or FSHCO to 65% of such voting Capital Stock; provided that no pledge agreements
shall be required under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Covered Jurisdictions; and

(2) substantially all of the other tangible and intangible assets (including, subject to certain exceptions and

thresholds, fee-owned real property and tangible and intangible personal property such as, among other assets,
intellectual property, investment property, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, contract rights, material bank
accounts and material intercompany receivables), in each case, that are held by the Issuer or any of the Note
Guarantors, to the extent that a security interest is able to be granted or perfected therein after use of commercially
reasonable efforts by the Issuer and applicable Note Guarantors.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by New York law and will contain customary

provisions for such intercreditor agreements governing priority of claims among secured creditors. See “—
Intercreditor Agreement.” While certain of the grantors are incorporated, organized, or have their center of main
interest in Austria, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland, the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement may not contain provisions that typically would be included in similar documents in
these local jurisdictions. For example, a typical European intercreditor agreement would address, on a contractual
basis, certain European insolvency and restructuring considerations which arise in the absence of consistent statutory
provisions in Europe equivalent to the framework under the Bankruptcy Code, including, among others, provisions
on standstill on the enforcement of liens on assets and on the making of claims on direct debt obligations and
guarantees, release or forced transfer of junior debt claims upon the occurrence of “distressed disposals” during a
restructuring or enforcement process and debt purchase options.

In addition, the lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security

documents entered into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to
the creation and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, charged or assigned, will
give it, in certain cases, as a matter of law, junior priority to the rights of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, the first priority lien of the holders of the notes with
respect to the Collateral will be dependent on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that the rights
of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral are secured on a first priority basis and to which the
collateral agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are a party. Such agreement may not be recognized
in certain jurisdictions.

The indenture and the Collateral Documents will exclude certain property from the Collateral (the “Excluded

Assets”), including:

(1) any lease, license, contract or agreement to which any grantor is a party, and any of its rights or interest

thereunder (or, with respect to clause (i), any other asset), if and to the extent that a security interest is prohibited by
or in violation of (or would result in a loss of material rights under) (i) any law, rule or regulation applicable to such
grantor, or (ii) a term, provision or condition of any such lease, license, contract or agreement (unless such law, rule,
regulation, term, provision or condition would be rendered ineffective with respect to the creation of the security
interest hereunder pursuant to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) (or
any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law (including the
Bankruptcy Code or the Personal Property Security Act (“PPSA”)) or principles of equity); provided, however, that
the Collateral shall include (and such security interest shall attach) immediately at such time as the contractual or
legal prohibition (or condition causing such violation, breach, termination or loss of right) shall no longer be
applicable and to the extent severable, shall attach immediately to any portion of such lease, license, contract or
agreement not subject to the prohibitions specified in clause (i) or (ii) above; provided further that the exclusions
referred to in this clause (1) shall not include any proceeds of any such lease, license, contract or agreement unless
such proceeds result in the consequences described in this clause (1) after giving effect to the first proviso in this
clause (1);

(2) any Excluded Securities;

(3) any “intent-to-use” application for registration of a trademark filed pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Lanham

Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1051, prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” pursuant to Section 1(d) of the Lanham Act or an
“Amendment to Allege Use” pursuant to Section 1(c) of the Lanham Act with respect thereto, to the extent, if any,


-----

that, and solely during the period, if any, in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity
or enforceability of any registration that issues from such intent-to-use application under applicable Federal law;

(4) any motor vehicles and any other assets subject to certificates of title to the extent that a Lien thereon

cannot be perfected by the filing of “all assets” financing statements or similar filings under the UCC, or any other
equivalent law, including the PPSA in the applicable grantor’s jurisdiction of organization or, if applicable, where
such asset is situated;

(5) any letter-of-credit rights (other than any letter-of-credit rights constituting a Supporting Obligation (as

defined in the UCC) for a receivable or other Collateral in which the Notes Collateral Agent has a valid and
perfected security interest) to the extent that a Lien thereon cannot be perfected by the filing of “all assets” financing
statements or similar filings under the UCC or any other equivalent law, including the PPSA in the applicable
grantor’s jurisdiction of organization;

(6) any Excluded Accounts;

(7)  any assets owned by any grantor on the date hereof or hereafter acquired and any proceeds thereof (or

related assets) that are subject to a Lien securing Indebtedness incurred in connection with a Finance Lease,
purchase money Indebtedness or other Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of such assets permitted to
be incurred pursuant to the indenture to the extent and for so long as the contract or other agreement in which such
Lien is granted (or the documentation providing for applicable purchase money Indebtedness) validly prohibits the
creation of any other Lien on such assets and proceeds;

(8) any property or assets in circumstances where the cost, burden or consequences (including adverse tax

consequences) of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in such property or assets (including on account of any
need to obtain consents or approvals, and the effect of the ability of the relevant grantor to conduct its operations and
business in the ordinary course), as determined in good faith by the Parent, are excessive in relation to the practical
benefit to the holders of the notes afforded in the indenture; provided that, if the Credit Agreement is then
outstanding, the same determination is made in respect of the Lien on such assets securing the Credit Agreement;

(9) any property constituting or that is the proceeds of aircraft, aircraft engines, satellites, ships or railroad

rolling stock (unless any such property or assets are pledged as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement), to the
extent that a Lien thereon cannot be perfected by the filing of “all assets” financing statements or similar filings
under the UCC or any other equivalent law, including the PPSA in the applicable grantor’s jurisdiction of
organization or, if applicable, where such asset is situated;

(10) any real property or real property interest with a Fair Market Value of no greater than $50.0 million

(unless any such real property is pledged, charged or assigned as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement) or
that is located in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood
hazards;

(11) any governmental or regulatory license or state, provincial, municipal or local franchise, charter, consent,

permit or authorization to the extent the granting of a security interest therein is prohibited or restricted thereby or by
applicable Requirements of Law; provided however, that any such asset will only constitute an Excluded Asset
under this clause (11) to the extent such prohibition or restriction would not be rendered ineffective pursuant to
applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC of any relevant jurisdiction, the PPSA or other similarly
applicable law; provided further that the exclusions referred to in this clause (11) shall not include any proceeds of
any such license, franchise, charter, consent, permit or authorization unless such proceeds independently constitute
an Excluded Asset;

(12) any asset or property (including Capital Stock) the grant or perfection of a security interest in which would

result in material adverse tax or regulatory consequences to any grantor or any of its subsidiaries as determined by
the Parent in good faith; provided, that this clause (12), as related to material adverse tax consequences, shall not
apply to any asset or property that is owned by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on the Issue Date and that is not
an Excluded Asset on the Issue Date (determined without regard to this clause (12) or to the extent such asset or
property remains as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement);

(13) Rule 3-16 Capital Stock (as defined below);


-----

(14) so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any asset that is not pledged, charged or assigned to secure

obligations arising in respect of the Credit Agreement (whether pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (and
any related documents) or as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or otherwise);

(15) Receivables Facility Assets (or interests therein) (including, without limitation, any trade receivables held

by the Parent and/or any Restricted Subsidiary) sold or otherwise transferred to a Receivables Entity or otherwise
pledged, transferred or sold, in each case, in connection with a Qualified Receivables Facility;

(16) any consumer goods (as defined in the PPSA) of any Canadian grantor;

(17) the last day of the term of any lease or agreement for lease of real property of any Canadian grantor;

provided that such last day will be held by such Canadian grantor in trust for the Notes Collateral Agent and, on the
Notes Collateral Agent’s exercise of any of its rights or remedies under the applicable Collateral Document
following an Event of Default, shall be assigned by such Canadian grantor as directed by the Notes Collateral Agent;
and

(18) any commercial tort claim involving a claim of less than $25.0 million (as determined in good faith by the

Parent).

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in addition to other exceptions and limitations

described in the Collateral Documents, and notwithstanding any action described below that is taken in favor of the
Credit Agreement, it is agreed and understood that (i) none of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor will be required to
(x) take any action to grant or perfect a security interest in any asset located outside of a Covered Jurisdiction or (y)
execute any security agreement, pledge agreement, mortgage, deed, charge or other collateral document governed by
the laws of any jurisdiction other than a Covered Jurisdiction, (ii) none of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor will be
required to take any action to perfect a security interest in the Collateral in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction
in which the Issuer or such Note Guarantor is organized or, in the case of a security interest in equity, a Covered
Jurisdiction, (iii) none of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor will be required to take any action to perfect any lien with
respect to (x) any vehicle or other asset subject to a certificate of title, or any retention of title, extended retention of
title rights, or similar rights and/or (y) letter-of-credit rights, in each case to the extent that a security interest therein
cannot be perfected by filing a financing statement under the UCC (or similar filings in foreign jurisdictions)
without the requirement to list any VIN, serial or other number, (iv) mortgages shall only be required in respect of
fee-owned real property with a fair market value in excess of $50.0 million (a) as of the Issue Date, with respect to
any such property owned by the Issuer or any Note Guarantor as of the Issue Date, or (b) as of the date of
acquisition thereof, with respect to any such property acquired by the Issuer or any Note Guarantor after the Issue
Date and, in the case of any such property located in the United States, so long as such property is not located in a
flood hazard area, (v) landlord waivers, estoppels, collateral access agreements or similar rights and agreements
shall not be required, (vi) the creation or perfection of any security interests through or by “control” (including
control agreements) shall not be required with respect to any Collateral (other than in respect of certain material
intercompany debt owing to the Issuer or any Note Guarantor (if applicable) and certificated equity interests to the
extent otherwise required to be pledged, charged or assigned) and (vii) the Collateral shall not include any property
for which the burden or cost (including adverse tax or regulatory consequences) of obtaining or perfecting a security
interest therein would outweigh the benefit to the holders of the notes as determined in good faith by the Parent, so
long as, in the case of clause (8), such property does not constitute collateral for the Credit Agreement (this
paragraph, the “Perfection Requirements”). The Collateral of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor organized in a
Covered Jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada shall also be subject to customary “Agreed Security
Principles” to be set forth in an exhibit to the indenture.

Additionally, (i) no action shall be required to create or perfect a Lien in any asset in respect of which the

creation or perfection of a security interest therein would (1) be prohibited by enforceable anti-assignment
provisions set forth in any contract directly relating to such asset (at the time of acquisition thereof and not incurred
in contemplation thereof (except if contemplated in connection with any licensing arrangement permitted
hereunder)) that is permitted or otherwise not prohibited by the terms of the indenture, (2) violate the terms of any
contract directly relating to such asset (at the time of acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation thereof
(except if contemplated in connection with any licensing arrangement permitted hereunder)) that is permitted or
otherwise not prohibited by the terms of the indenture, in each case, after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law or (3) trigger termination of any contract directly relating
to such asset (at the time of acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation thereof (except if contemplated in


-----

connection with any licensing arrangement permitted hereunder)) that is permitted or otherwise not prohibited by the
terms of the indenture pursuant to any “change of control” or similar provision (in each case after giving effect to
any applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law), it being understood that the
Collateral shall include any proceeds and/or receivables arising out of any contract described in this clause (other
than Excluded Assets) to the extent the assignment of such proceeds or receivables is expressly deemed effective
under the UCC or other applicable Requirements of Law notwithstanding the relevant prohibition, violation or
termination right, (ii) neither the Issuer nor any Note Guarantor shall be required to create or perfect a security
interest in any asset to the extent the creation or perfection of a security interest in such asset would (A) be
prohibited under any applicable Requirements of Law, after giving effect to any applicable anti-assignment
provision of the UCC or other applicable law and other than proceeds thereof to the extent that the assignment of
such proceeds is effective under the UCC or other applicable Requirements of Law notwithstanding such
Requirements of Law and/or (B) require any governmental consent, approval, license or authorization (unless such
consent, approval, license or authorization has been obtained), after giving effect to any applicable anti-assignment
provision of the UCC or other applicable law and other than proceeds thereof to the extent that the assignment of
such proceeds is effective under the UCC or other applicable Requirements of Law notwithstanding such consent or
restriction, (iii) any joinder or supplement to the indenture, any Note Guarantee, any Collateral Document, any
intercreditor agreement and/or other document executed by any Restricted Subsidiary that is required to become a
Note Guarantor pursuant to the section “—Note Guarantees,” include such amendments as may be necessary to
qualify any representation or warranty set forth in any such document to the extent necessary to ensure that such
representation or warranty is true and correct to the extent required thereby or by the terms of any other such
document and (iv) (A) none of the Issuer nor any Note Guarantor will be required to take any action required under
the Federal Assignment of Claims Act or any similar law and (B) no Person with a security interest in the Collateral
will be permitted to exercise any right of setoff in respect of any account maintained solely for the purpose of
receiving and holding government receivables.

Further, the indenture and the Collateral Documents will not require the Note Guarantors to perfect a security

interest in certain other collateral, including any asset if such asset does not constitute “Collateral” (or equivalent
term) under the Credit Agreement security documents or where the Issuer and the Note Guarantors are not required
to take such actions under the Credit Agreement security documents.

The Agreed Security Principles will provide the amount recoverable in respect of the Collateral provided by the

Issuer and the Note Guarantors will be limited as necessary to (1) prevent such Collateral from being in breach of
any applicable law, (2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general statutory limitations, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims or similar matters or (3) avoid a conflict with
the fiduciary duties of such company’s directors, contravention of any legal prohibition or regulatory condition, or
the material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officers or directors, in each case as determined by the
Issuer in its sole discretion. Such limitations could significantly impact the amounts recoverable upon the exercise of
remedies with respect to such Collateral. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

In certain jurisdictions, a security interest in certain assets can be pledged to or perfected with respect to (as

applicable) one secured party only pursuant to local laws governing such collateral or local practice applicable to
such collateral. The Credit Agreement Collateral Agent holding a lien on such assets may not be acting as agent with
respect to such collateral under such local laws for the benefit of the noteholders and therefore the noteholders may
not have a lien on such assets, and in such case the indenture will not require the Issuer and the Note Guarantors to
grant liens on such assets, or require the entry into of any joint or common agency or similar arrangement.

In certain jurisdictions, the security over the Collateral that (if and when granted) will constitute security for the

obligations under the notes and the indenture related thereto will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes
but only in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, as beneficiaries of parallel debt or analogous obligations, or
“parallel debt.

Subject to the foregoing and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if applicable, if property that is intended

to be Collateral is acquired by the Issuer or a Note Guarantor (including property of a Person that becomes a new
Note Guarantor) and is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the Collateral Documents,
then the Issuer or such Note Guarantor will provide a lien over such property consistent with the liens granted over
similar property in the applicable jurisdiction (or in the case of any jurisdiction where no liens were previously
granted, to the extent customary and reasonably achievable under applicable local law) (or, in the case of a new Note


-----

Guarantor, such of its property consistent with the liens granted over similar property in the applicable jurisdiction
(or in the case of any jurisdiction where no liens were previously granted, to the extent customary and reasonably
achievable under applicable local law)) in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and deliver certain certificates and
opinions in respect thereof, all as and to the extent required by the indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
or the Collateral Documents.

As set out in more detail below, subject to certain exceptions, upon an enforcement event, bankruptcy,

insolvency or liquidation proceeding, proceeds from the Shared Collateral will be applied to satisfy obligations
under the Credit Agreement and under the notes and under additional first lien debt that may be issued in the future
that is subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement on a pari passu basis. In addition, the indenture will permit
the Issuer and the Note Guarantors to create additional Liens under specified circumstances.

The Collateral (1) has been pledged to Wilmington Trust (London) Limited (in such capacity, and together with

its permitted successors, the “Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”) on a first priority basis, for the benefit of the
secured parties under the Credit Agreement to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement and (2) subject to
certain exceptions, will be pledged to the Notes Collateral Agent, on a first priority basis, for its benefit and the
benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes to secure the obligations under the notes. Certain of the Shared
Collateral that has already been pledged to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will, pursuant to certain laws
governing such Collateral, not be capable of being pledged with same priority to the Notes Collateral Agent and will
by way of being pledged later in time rank junior to the existing security granted to the Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent. However, proceeds from enforcement of such Collateral are intended to be distributed amongst the relevant
secured parties in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and the Guarantees—Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien
on the Shared Collateral, the representative of the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will
initially have the exclusive right to control actions (including the exercise of remedies) with respect to the Shared
Collateral. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary provisions for a New York (U.S.) law
intercreditor agreement, but will not contain any provisions that seek to address European, Canadian or other nonNew York (U.S.) law insolvency and restructuring considerations typically available in European, Canadian or other
non-New York (U.S.) law intercreditor agreements.”

To the extent that Liens (including Permitted Liens), rights or easements granted to third parties encumber

assets located on property owned by the Issuer or the Note Guarantors, including the Collateral, such third parties
may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the holders of the notes to realize
or foreclose on Collateral.

**_Certain Bankruptcy and Insolvency Limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an

Event of Default (as described below under “—Events of Default and Remedies”) would be significantly impaired
by, or at a minimum delayed by, U.S. bankruptcy law in the event that a U.S. bankruptcy case were to be
commenced by or against the Issuer or any Note Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee, as
applicable, having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the
Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is generally prohibited from foreclosing
upon, repossessing or taking control of its security from the debtor in the subject case, or from disposing of security
previously repossessed without prior court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). See also
“Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
and the Security Interests.”

In view of the broad powers of U.S. bankruptcy courts, and the lack of a precise definition of the term

“adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the
notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring proceeding (or
the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or
dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what
extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through
“adequate protection” or otherwise.


-----

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court in a U.S. bankruptcy case determines that the value of the

Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and all other pari passu secured debt, the holders of
the notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the holders of the notes
are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or
accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s
bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the
bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral.

See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of

the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a discussion of the bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement and similar
laws of other jurisdictions to which the Issuer or a Note Guarantor could become subject.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the indenture will provide that the first

priority liens securing the Note Guarantee of any Note Guarantor will be automatically released when such Note
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee is released in accordance with the terms of the indenture. In addition, the first priority
liens securing the notes will be released (a) in whole, upon a legal defeasance or a covenant defeasance of the notes
as set forth below under “—Defeasance,” (b) in whole, upon satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, (c) in
whole, upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the notes issued under the indenture,
(d) in whole or in part, with the consent of the requisite holders of the notes in accordance with the provisions under
“—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver,” including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for, or purchase of, notes, (e) in whole, upon the occurrence of a Fall Away Event and (f) in part, as
to any asset (A)(I) constituting Collateral that is sold or otherwise disposed of by the Issuer or any of the Note
Guarantors to any Person that is not an Issuer or a Note Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture (to
the extent of the interest sold or disposed of), or (II) constituting Shared Collateral, in connection with the taking of
an enforcement action by the Applicable Authorized Representative and Applicable Collateral Agent (as defined in
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of any first priority lien obligations in accordance with the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (B) that is held by a Note Guarantor that ceases to be a Note Guarantor, (C) that
becomes Excluded Assets, including so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any asset that is not pledged to
secure obligations arising in respect of the Credit Agreement (whether pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement
(and any related documents) or as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or
otherwise) or (D) that is otherwise released in accordance with, and as expressly provided for by the terms of, the
indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral Documents; provided that in the case of clause
(f)(A)(II), the proceeds of such Shared Collateral shall be applied in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Parent will constitute Collateral securing the notes and the related

Note Guarantees only to the extent that such Capital Stock can secure the notes and Note Guarantees without Rule
3-16 of Regulation S-X (or any other law, rule or regulation) requiring separate financial statements of the Parent
(on an unconsolidated basis) or such Subsidiary, to be filed with the SEC (or any other governmental agency). In the
event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X requires or is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is
replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the
filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of the Parent (on an
unconsolidated basis) or any such Subsidiary due to the fact that such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock secures the notes
and the Note Guarantees, then such Capital Stock shall automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral
securing the notes and Note Guarantees (but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement)
(such Capital Stock, the “Rule 3-16 Capital Stock”). In such event, the Collateral Documents may be amended or
modified, without the consent of any holder, to the extent necessary to release the security interests on the Rule 3-16
Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral.

In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is

replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such
Subsidiary’s Capital Stock to secure the notes and the Note Guarantees in excess of the amount then pledged
without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of the Parent
(on an unconsolidated basis) or any such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary shall automatically
be deemed to be a part of the Collateral securing the notes and Note Guarantees (but only to the extent such
Subsidiary would not be subject to any such financial statement requirement). In such event, the Collateral


-----

Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder, to the extent necessary to subject such
Capital Stock to the Liens under the Collateral Documents.

**_Perfection and Non-Perfection of Security Interests in Collateral_**

The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent in certain of the Collateral will not be in place on the Issue

Date. To the extent any liens on or security interest in the Collateral securing the notes are not granted or perfected
on or prior to such date, the indenture will require us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such
security interests granted and perfected, to the extent required by the indenture and the Collateral Documents, within
120 days of such date (which date will be automatically extended if the corresponding deadline under the Credit
Agreement is extended with the consent of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent); however no assurance can be
given that such security interest will be granted or perfected on a timely basis, or at all. It will not be a Default or
Event of Default if we are unable to grant or perfect any such security interest by such date, provided we have used
our commercially reasonable efforts to do so. In addition, the Collateral Documents may not require the Issuer and
the Note Guarantors to take certain actions to perfect the liens of the Notes Collateral Agent in certain of the
Collateral, including, prior to the repayment in full of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, if such actions are
not requested by the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral. As a result, the first priority
liens may not attach or be perfected in certain of the Collateral, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders
of the notes with respect to such Collateral.

**_After-Acquired Property_**

The indenture will provide that, from and after the Issue Date, upon the acquisition by the Issuer or any Note

Guarantor of any After-Acquired Property that is required to become Collateral under the indenture or any Collateral
Document or upon any new Subsidiary becoming a Note Guarantor, the Issuer or such Note Guarantor shall, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, if applicable, within 120 days (or such longer period as permitted by the Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent), execute and deliver such mortgages, deeds of trust, security instruments, financing
statements, certificates and opinions of counsel as shall be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a
perfected security interest, subject only to Permitted Liens and the Perfection Requirements, in such After-Acquired
Property or in the Collateral of such Note Guarantor and to have such After-Acquired Property or such Collateral
(but subject to certain limitations, if applicable, including as described under “—Security”) added to the Collateral,
and thereupon all provisions of the indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such AfterAcquired Property or Collateral to the same extent and with the same force and effect; provided, however, that if
granting such security interest in such After-Acquired Property or Collateral requires the consent of a third party, to
the extent such actions are also taken with respect to the Credit Agreement, the Issuer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent with respect to the security interest in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the notes; provided further,
_however, that if such third party does not consent to the granting of such security interest after the use of such_
commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer or such Note Guarantor, as the case may be, will not be required to
provide such security interest.

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time

to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent with respect to the
Shared Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders to add other parties
holding first priority obligations permitted to be incurred under the indenture, the Credit Agreement, and the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement (“First Priority Obligations”). All references to the First Priority Obligations in this
section of the Description of the Notes shall refer only to such First Priority Obligations subject to the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” or “Applicable

Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The
Applicable Authorized Representative and the Applicable Collateral Agent will on the Issue Date be the Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the
discharge of First Priority Obligations that are obligations under the Credit Agreement and (2) the Non-Applicable
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized
Representative Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable


-----

Authorized Representative will be the representative of the Series of First Priority Obligations that constitutes the
largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Obligations as such
representative is notified by the Issuer. As of the Issue Date, the Trustee for the notes shall be deemed to be the
Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and shall remain the Major Non-Applicable Authorized
Representative until such time as it is notified in writing by the Issuer or the Applicable Authorized Representative
that another representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative. The Issuer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide a prompt written notice to the Trustee and the Applicable Authorized
Representative upon any such determination, it being understood that the Issuer shall be entitled to rely upon
certifications from the applicable representative in making such determination.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no representative of a Series of First Priority Obligations that is not the

Applicable Authorized Representative (“Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”) or the Applicable Collateral
Agent nor the holders of indebtedness for which any Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is a representative
(“Non-Controlling Secured Party”) shall have the right to direct the Applicable Authorized Representative or
Applicable Collateral Agent to exercise, or to consent to any exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative
or Applicable Collateral Agent, any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared Collateral. Only the
Applicable Authorized Representative and/or the Applicable Collateral Agent shall be entitled to take any such
actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral. In the event of certain enforcement actions
by the Applicable Collateral Agent that result in the sale or other disposition of Shared Collateral consisting of
Capital Stock of the Issuer or a Note Guarantor or a Parent Entity thereof (other than, with respect to any Series of
First Priority Obligations, any such Parent Entity that is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer or a Note
Guarantor) (any such entity, with respect to any first priority lien obligations, a “Disposed Entity”), the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the claims of any first priority lien obligations (whether direct or through a
guarantee) will be released against such Disposed Entity and each of its Subsidiaries and all the Liens on the Shared
Collateral of such Disposed Entity and its Subsidiaries shall be released; provided that the proceeds of such sale or
other disposition shall be applied in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The “Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non
Applicable Authorized Representative, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonApplicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series
of First Priority Obligations, and (b) the receipt by the Applicable Authorized Representative and each other
representative of First Priority Obligations (each such representative of First Priority Obligations, a “First Priority
Collateral Agent”) of written notice from such Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative certifying that
(i) such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and
that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of First Priority Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Obligations of that Series with respect to which such Major
Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full
(whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that
Series of First Priority Obligations; provided that such event of default shall be continuing at the end of such 180day period; provided, further, that the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed
and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the
Applicable Authorized Representative and/or Applicable Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing
any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Note Guarantor
that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise
subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Applicable Authorized Representative and the Applicable Collateral Agent will each on the Issue Date be

the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, and the Notes Collateral Agent will not have any rights to take any action
under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee
becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Notes Collateral Agent becomes the Applicable
Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling

Secured Party (as such term is defined below) may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Applicable Authorized
Representative or the Controlling Secured Party had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral (subject to applicable
local law limitations). No Non-Applicable Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will be
permitted to contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized


-----

Representative or any holders of indebtedness for which the Applicable Authorized Representative is a
representative (“Controlling Secured Party”) or any other exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative or
any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the holders of
the notes and secured parties under the Credit Agreement and the holders of any additional first lien debt that may
be issued in the future that is subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (the “First Priority Secured Parties”)
also agree that they will not question, contest or support any other person in questioning or contesting, in any
proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or
enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the
Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Priority

Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the Applicable Authorized Representative and/or the Applicable
Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made
with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding of the Issuer
(including any adequate protection payments) or any Note Guarantor, or any First Priority Secured Party receives
any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect
to any Shared Collateral, then the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral
by any First Priority Collateral Agent or pursuant to such distribution or received by any First Priority Secured Party
pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral (subject, in the case of any such
proceeds, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First Priority Obligations are entitled under any
other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the First Priority Obligations to the payment in full of the First
Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each First Priority Collateral Agent (in
its capacity as such) and each administrative agent (or other equivalent term or role) for any First Priority
Obligations; provided that following the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding
of the Issuer or any other Note Guarantor, solely for purposes of the waterfall provisions of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement and not any other document with respect to any First Priority Obligation, in the event the
value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest on the First Priority
Obligations to be allowed under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision
of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law in such bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding, the
amount of First Priority Obligations of each Series of First Priority Obligations shall include only the maximum
amount of post-petition interest allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other
applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law in such bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring
proceeding.

The First Priority Secured Parties of each Series agree that the holders of First Priority Obligations of such

Series (and not the First Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under
applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations),
(y) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the
Shared Collateral securing any other Series of First Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest
exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior
to the security interest of such Series of First Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other
Series of First Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Priority
Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with
respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided that the existence of a
maximum claim with respect to any properties subject to a Mortgage (as defined in the Credit Agreement (or the
equivalent provision thereof)) which applies to all First Priority Obligations shall not be deemed to be an
Impairment of any Series of First Priority Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of
First Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First
Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Priority Obligations (including, without
limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Priority Obligations permitted by the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent
necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Priority
Obligations subject to such Impairment.

Additionally, in the event the First Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law

(including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First


-----

Priority Obligations or the Collateral Documents governing such First Priority Obligations will be deemed to refer to
such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring

proceedings or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Applicable
Collateral Agent or any other First Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific
performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral and none of the Applicable Authorized
Representative, Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by the Applicable Authorized Representative, Applicable Collateral Agent or other First
Lien Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may challenge or question, or support any other
Person in challenging or questioning, in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of any First Priority
Obligations of any Series or any first priority security document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of
any Lien under any first priority security document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties
established by or other provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured
Parties may take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or
delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
Shared Collateral by the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent. In addition, none of
the First Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any
foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Priority Secured Party obtains possession of
any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Collateral Document or
by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or
through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the
discharge of each of the First Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in
trust for the other First Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment
to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the

Controlling Secured Party forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in
a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time)
the Liens in favor of the other First Priority Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral
Agent and the holders of the notes and each other Series of First Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared
Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon the earlier of (i) the conclusion of the applicable
foreclosure proceeding or other exercise of remedies and (ii) as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the
Applicable Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of
any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If the Issuer or any Note Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceedings,

the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Note Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-inpossession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP
Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code), or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable
debtor relief law) or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or under any equivalent
provision of any other applicable debtor relief law), each First Priority Secured Party agrees not to object to any
such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use
of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to
such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash
collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral
for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens
with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than
any Liens of any First Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to
the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to
secure the First Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will
confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in
each case so long as:

(a) First Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral

pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with


-----

the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority
Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the insolvency or
liquidation proceedings;

(b) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to

any First Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use
of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority

Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and

(d) if any First Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic

payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection
are applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided that the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_

secure the DIP Financing over any collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Priority Secured Parties of such
Series or its or their representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First
Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection agree that they shall not object to any other First Priority
Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Priority
Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The First Priority Secured Parties therein acknowledge that the First Priority Obligations of any Series may,

subject to the limitations set forth in the other documents governing the First Priority Obligations, be increased,
extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise
amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set
forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First
Priority Secured Parties of any Series.

By its acceptance of notes, each holder will be deemed to have consented to the terms of the Collateral

Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform each of the Collateral Documents and First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement to which it is a party, binding the holders to the terms thereof.

Subject to the terms of the Collateral Documents, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors have the right to remain in

possession and retain exclusive control of the Shared Collateral securing the notes (other than any cash, securities,
obligations and Cash Equivalents constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the Applicable Authorized
Representative in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents and other than as set forth in the
Collateral Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

**_No Impairment of the Security Interests_**

Except as otherwise permitted under the indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral

Documents, none of the Issuer nor any of the Note Guarantors will be permitted to take any action, or knowingly
omit to take any action, which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest
with respect to the Collateral in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent and the holders of the notes.

**_Amendment of Collateral Documents_**

The Issuer will not be permitted to amend, modify or supplement, or agree to permit or consent to any

amendment, modification or supplement of, the Collateral Documents in any way that would be adverse to the
holders of the notes in any material respect, except as described above under “—Security” or as permitted under “—
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”


-----

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of any successor to the Issuer that is organized or incorporated in a

jurisdiction outside the United States under or with respect to the notes or by or on behalf of any Note Guarantor,
under or with respect to any Note Guarantee (each such person, a “Payor”) will be made free and clear of any
withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge
of whatever nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which such Payor is
organized, resident or carrying on business for tax purposes or from or through which such Payor makes any
payment on the notes or its Note Guarantee or any department or political subdivision of any of the foregoing, other
than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless
the Payor (or an applicable withholding agent) is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by applicable law. If the
Payor (or an applicable withholding agent) is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of
Taxes of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to any notes or Note
Guarantee, the Payor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as
may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each holder or beneficial owner of the notes after such
withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable
hereunder) will not be less than the amount the holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had
not been required to be so withheld or deducted.

A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a holder or beneficial owner of notes:

(a) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the

existence of any present or former connection between the holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary,
settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder or beneficial owner, if such
holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other
than any connection resulting solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of notes, the receipt of
payments thereunder or under any Note Guarantee and/ or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any notes or
any Note Guarantee);

(b) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the

failure of the holder or beneficial owner of notes, following the Issuer’s or the Payor’s written request addressed to
the holder, to the extent such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the
rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without
limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) with respect to any Taxes payable other than by withholding or deduction from payments under or with

respect to the notes;

(d) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise or personal property tax or

any similar Taxes;

(e) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the

presentation by the holder or beneficial owner of any notes, where presentation is required, for payment on a date
more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is
duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(f) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts are U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed

pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as in effect on the date hereof (or any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future
regulations, official interpretations or administrative authority promulgated thereunder and any agreements entered
into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code as in effect on the date hereof (or any amended or successor version
that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any intergovernmental agreement (and related legislation, rules or practices) implementing the foregoing (taken


-----

together, “FATCA”), except to the extent that such Taxes result from a failure of any paying agent to comply with
FATCA;

(g) with respect to any Taxes imposed by France if such Taxes are imposed solely because a payment is made to

a holder or beneficial owner of notes being established, incorporated or acting through an office located in a noncooperative state or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) as set out in the list referred to in article 238-0 A of
the French Code Général des impôts, as such list may be amended from time to time or because this payment is
made on an account opened in the name of a holder or beneficial owner of notes in a financial institution situated in
a non-cooperative state or territory;

(h) with respect to any Taxes imposed by France if such Taxes are imposed solely because the Payor is

established in France and is required to withhold, declare and pay at source French personal income tax of a holder
or beneficial owner of notes being a French tax resident individual chargeable on interests or assimilated incomes
yielding under the notes in accordance with article 125 A of the French Code Général des impôts;

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for (i) the

holder or beneficial owner of notes being a person with whom the Note Guarantor is not dealing at arm's length
(within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)), (ii) the holder or beneficial owner of notes being a person
who is, or who does not deal at arm’s length with any person who is, a “specified shareholder” (as defined in
subsection 18(5) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) of the Note Guarantor for the purposes of thin capitalization rules
in the Income Tax Act (Canada) or (iii) the Note Guarantor being a "specified entity" (as defined in subsection
18.4(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) as proposed in Bill C-59, which received first reading on November 30,
2023) in respect of the holder or beneficial owner of notes

(j) with respect to any Taxes imposed by Finland if such Taxes are imposed solely because the Payor is

established in Finland and is required to withhold, declare and pay at source Finnish personal income tax of a holder
or beneficial owner of notes being a Finnish tax resident individual chargeable on interests or assimilated incomes
yielding under the notes in accordance with article 9 of the Finnish income tax act or the Finnish withholding tax act
on interest paid to certain Finnish individuals or the Finnish act on tax prepayments; or

(k) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j).

Additional Amounts also will not be paid with respect to any payment on any note or Note Guarantee to a

beneficial owner who is a fiduciary, a partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for tax purposes), or anyone
other than the sole beneficial owner of that payment to the extent that payment would be required by the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect
to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the
Additional Amounts had that beneficiary, settlor, member or interest holder been the beneficial owner.

The Payor or applicable withholding agent will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by

applicable law and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law. The Payor, or the applicable withholding agent, will make reasonable efforts to
obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor, or the applicable withholding agent, will provide to
the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due
pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy of tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts
are not reasonably available to the Payor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such
payment by the Payor.

The Payor will deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be

payable prior to the date on which such payments will be made, and the amounts so payable, and will set forth such
other information necessary to enable the Trustee (or applicable paying agent) to pay such Additional Amounts to
holders on the payment date. Any such certificate will be delivered a reasonable amount of time in advance of when
the payments in question are required to be made. The Payor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the
provisions of the indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to
pay such amounts.


-----

The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the holders or beneficial owners of notes, upon written request

of such holder or beneficial owner of notes and certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or
imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such holder or beneficial owner in connection with
payments made under or with respect to the notes or any Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with
respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by
such holder or beneficial owner after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such holder or
beneficial owner would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or
(ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this paragraph
shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the holder or beneficial owner of the notes would not have been eligible
to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (a) through (j) above or to the extent such
holder or beneficial owner received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes,

charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of the notes or any Note
Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed
by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made
pursuant to the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder and/or
(ii) the enforcement of the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to
thereunder.

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the

indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, to any Payor and to any jurisdiction in which
such successor is organized (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia), carrying on
business or is otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia) from or through which payment is made by such successor or its respective agents.
Whenever the indenture or this “Description of the Notes” refers to, in any context, the payment of principal,
premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any note or under any Note
Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts or indemnification payments as described
hereunder, if applicable.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to     , 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the

aggregate principal amount of notes (including notes issued after the Issue Date, if any) issued under the indenture at
a redemption price of       % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of notes (including notes issued after the Issue Date, if any)

issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding
notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time on or prior to  , 2027, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, upon

notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes issued under the indenture (including any additional notes) during any 12-month period at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date, subject to the right of holders of notes of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption
date.

On or after     , 2027, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60

days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued
and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during
the twelve-month period beginning on          of the years indicated below:


-----

2027 ........................................................................................................... %

2028 ........................................................................................................... %

2029 and thereafter .................................................................................... 100.000%

At any time prior to      , 2027, the Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price

equal to the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and unpaid interest
to, but not including, the date of redemption. The Issuer shall calculate the redemption price, including any
Applicable Premium.

**_Notice of Redemption_**

In connection with any optional redemption of the notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be

subject to one or more conditions precedent. If a redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, the applicable redemption notice shall describe such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the
Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied, without the requirement of an additional notice period to the holders, or such redemption may not occur
and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.

**_Optional Redemption due to Tax Reasons_**

If any Note Guarantor or any successor to the Issuer becomes obligated to pay, on the next date on which any

amount will be payable with respect to the notes, any Additional Amounts as a result of (i) any amendment to, or
change in, the laws, treaties (or rulings, protocols or regulations promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (as defined above) which amendment or change is publicly announced and becomes effective after the
date hereof (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after
the date hereof, after such later date) or (ii) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or
application of such laws, treaties (or rulings, protocols or regulations promulgated thereunder) (including by virtue
of a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction) which amendment or change is publicly announced and becomes
effective after the date hereof (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the date hereof, after such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a “Change
in Tax Law”) and the applicable Note Guarantor or successor to the Issuer cannot avoid any such payment
obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a paying agent located
in another jurisdiction, provided that changing the jurisdiction of the applicable Note Guarantor (but only in the
event none of the Issuer, successor to the Issuer or other Note Guarantors can make the relevant payment without
triggering additional amounts) or successor to the Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section),
the Issuer may, at its option, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the
holders, redeem the notes then outstanding, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date and all
Additional Amounts (if any) then due and that will become due on the redemption date as a result of the redemption
or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof); provided, however, that if such
right to redeem is triggered by the obligation of a Note Guarantor or successor to the Issuer to pay Additional
Amounts, such right to redeem will apply only if the payment giving rise to such obligation cannot be made by
another Note Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts. Notice of the Issuer’s intent to redeem
the notes shall not be given until the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that there
has been such Change in Tax Law which would require the Note Guarantor or successor to the Issuer to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to the notes hereunder and an officer’s certificate to the effect that the applicable
Note Guarantor or successor to the Issuer (but, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made
by another Note Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) cannot avoid its obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it. The Issuer will not give any such notice of intent
to redeem the notes earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the relevant Note Guarantor or successor
to the Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding (if a payment in respect of the notes or the
Note Guarantees were then due) and unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts remains in effect. The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to the
applicable Note Guarantor, after such successor Person becomes a party to the indenture, with respect to a Change in
Tax Law that is publicly announced and becomes effective after such successor Person becomes a party to the
indenture.


-----

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.

However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the notes as described under
the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders.”

**Other Purchases**

The Parent and its Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time attempt to acquire or acquire notes by

means other than a redemption, whether pursuant to an issuer tender offer, open market purchases or otherwise,
assuming such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the indenture; provided, that this paragraph does
not provide the Issuer with any additional rights to redeem the notes other than as explicitly provided for in the
indenture. In connection with any such acquisition, the Issuer may seek and obtain holders’ consent to amendments
to the indenture.

**Repurchase at the Option of the Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or

any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s notes pursuant to an
offer (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth in the indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the
Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control
Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will transmit a notice to each holder of
notes describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
notes on the date specified in the notice (such date, the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which date will be no
earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the indenture (or in accordance with the procedures of the depositary) and described in such notice. The
Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of
the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or

portions of notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted together with an officer’s

certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by the Issuer.

The paying agent will promptly mail (or transmit by wire transfer) to each holder of notes properly tendered the

Change of Control Payment for such notes, and upon receipt of written instruction from the Issuer, the Trustee will
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new note will be in
a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as reasonably

practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain provisions that

permit the holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between
the Issuer and the initial purchasers. Management evaluates transactions which could result in a Change of Control


-----

from time to time and may engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control in the future. Subject to the
limitations discussed below, the Parent could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could
increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Parent’s capital structure or
credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness
are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes upon a Change of

Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes in the manner, at the times
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer,
(2) notice of redemption with respect to the notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under
the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption
price, or (3) after giving effect to such Change of Control, (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, (ii) the Change of Control transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, and
(iii) the notes have received an Investment Grade Rating from at least two of the Rating Agencies. In addition, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control,
if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of launching the Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as

a result of a Change of Control (including any required notice period) may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes, including after the entry into of an agreement
that would result in the need to make a Change of Control Offer.

With respect to the notes, in the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the

outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer
purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, within 60 days of such purchase, all
of the holders of the notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer
will have the right, upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all of the notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,

conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially
all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder
of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of less than all of the assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another
Person or group may be uncertain.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Parent (or its Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset

Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this clause (1), by the Parent or, in the case
of any asset(s) valued in excess of $300.0 million, by the Board of Directors) of the assets or Equity Interests issued
or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale

by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.

(3) For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as shown on the most

recent consolidated balance sheet of the Parent (or in the notes thereto), or if the incurrence of such


-----

Indebtedness or other liability took place after the date of such balance sheet, that would have been shown on
such balance sheet or in the notes thereto, as determined in good faith by the Parent (other than Indebtedness or
other liabilities that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes and the Note Guarantees
(“Subordinated Debt”) or that are owed to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary) (i) that is assumed by the
transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary
from further liability, (ii) that is discharged by the transferee in a transaction pursuant to which neither the
Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any liability following such Asset Sale or (iii) that is otherwise
cancelled or terminated in connection with such Asset Sale;

(b) any securities, notes, other obligations or assets received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary

from such transferee (including earn-outs or similar obligations) that are converted by the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or
Cash Equivalents, within 180 days after the consummation of the applicable Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash
or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken

together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not
exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect
to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $135.0 million or 25.0% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA;

(d) future payments to be made in cash or Cash Equivalents owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary

in the form of licensing, royalty, earnout or milestone payment (or similar deferred cash payments); and

(e) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets acquired in

connection with such Asset Sale.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Parent or the applicable

Restricted Subsidiary may apply the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(1) to repay (x) secured Indebtedness and other Obligations under the Credit Agreement and, if the

Indebtedness repaid under the Credit Agreement is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto, (y) Indebtedness and other Obligations under the notes or any Pari Passu
Indebtedness (other than the Credit Agreement) and, if the Pari Passu Indebtedness being repaid is revolving credit
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto (provided that if such Net Proceeds are
applied to repay such Pari Passu Indebtedness under this clause (y), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce
obligations under the notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” through
privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases (in each case, provided that such purchases are at or
above 100% of the principal amount thereof), or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth
below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the pro rata principal amount of notes) or (z) (I) other Indebtedness of a
Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, so long as the relevant assets were assets of such Subsidiary or (II) if the assets sold
were not Collateral, any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Debt) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted

Business or the minority interest of any Permitted Business;

(3) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in a

Permitted Business;

(4) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business;

(5) to retire notes (x) pursuant to the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” (y) through privately

negotiated transactions or open market purchases, or (z) by making an offer to purchase notes in accordance with the
procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer; or

(6) to acquire other assets (other than Cash and Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Permitted

Business;


-----

_provided that (i) a binding commitment to apply any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale as set forth in clauses (2),_

(3), (4) or (6) above shall be treated as a permitted application of the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net
Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries enters into
such commitment with the good faith expectation that the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds
will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the end of such 450-day period (an “Acceptable
Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before
the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then the Parent or
such Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted to apply the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds
in any manner set forth above before the expiration of such 180-day period and, in the event the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary fails to do so, then the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds shall constitute
Excess Proceeds (as defined below) and (ii) the Parent may elect to deem certain expenditures (including
Investments) that would otherwise be permissible reinvestments but that occurred prior to the receipt of the
applicable Net Proceeds as having been reinvested in accordance with the provisions of this covenant, but only to
the extent such deemed expenditure (or Investment) shall have been made no earlier than the earlier of the execution
of a definitive agreement with respect to such Asset Sale or the consummation thereof.

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, (x) the Parent shall not be required to apply any

amount that would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to this covenant to the extent that the Asset Sale is
consummated by any Foreign Subsidiary for so long as the Parent determines in good faith that the repatriation to
the Parent of any such amount would be prohibited or delayed (beyond the time period during which such
application is otherwise required to be made pursuant to this covenant) under any Requirements of Law or conflict
with the fiduciary duties of such Foreign Subsidiary’s directors, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of
management or consultant of such Foreign Subsidiary (including on account of financial assistance, corporate
benefit, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar considerations); it being understood and agreed that
(i) solely within 450 days following the event giving rise to the relevant Net Proceeds, the Parent shall take all
commercially reasonable actions required by applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation and (ii) if
such repatriation is permitted under the applicable Requirements of Law and, to the extent applicable, would no
longer conflict with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a
material risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, in either case, within 450 days
following the event giving rise to the relevant Net Proceeds, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate
the relevant Net Proceeds, and the repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than two
Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against such Net
Proceeds, as a result thereof, by the Parent or its Subsidiaries, and any Affiliates or indirect or direct equity owners
of the foregoing) as required by this covenant (without giving regard to this paragraph), (y) the Parent shall not be
required to apply any amount that would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to this covenant to the extent
that the relevant Net Proceeds are generated by any Joint Venture (including any Subsidiary that is not a WhollyOwned Subsidiary) or the relevant Net Proceeds are received by any Joint Venture (including any Subsidiary that is
not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) for so long as the Parent determines in good faith that the distribution to the Parent
of such Net Proceeds would be prohibited under any applicable (I) Organizational Documents (or any relevant
shareholders’ or similar agreement) governing such Joint Venture, (II) agreement or instrument (including a
financing arrangement) entered into with a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or (III) judgment,
decree, order, statute or governmental rule or regulation; it being understood that if the relevant prohibition ceases to
exist within the 450-day period following the event giving rise to the relevant Net Proceeds, the relevant Joint
Venture will promptly distribute the Net Proceeds and the Net Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later
than ten Business Days after such distribution) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a
result thereof) as required by this covenant. In addition, if the Parent determines in good faith that the repatriation
(or other intercompany distribution) to the Parent of any amounts required to be applied by this covenant would
result in material and adverse tax consequences for the Parent or any of its subsidiaries, Affiliates or indirect or
direct equity owners, taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such
repatriation (such amount, a “Restricted Amount”), as determined by the Parent in good faith, the amount the Parent
shall be required to apply as set forth in this covenant shall be reduced by the Restricted Amount; provided that to
the extent that the repatriation (or other intercompany distribution) of any Net Proceeds from the relevant Foreign
Subsidiary would no longer have a material and adverse tax consequence within the 450-day period following the
event giving rise to the Net Proceeds, an amount equal to the Net Proceeds not previously applied pursuant to this
paragraph shall be promptly applied as otherwise required by this covenant (without regard to this paragraph).


-----

Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Parent or a Restricted

Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner
that is not prohibited by the indenture.

The Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as

provided in the preceding three paragraphs will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds $300.0 million, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of notes and all
holders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect
to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of
notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The
offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer (“Declined Asset Sale Proceeds”), the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be purchased on a pro rata
basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to
make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon
such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not
be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Parent may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited
under the indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable

securities laws and regulations to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each
repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The agreements governing the Parent’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other Indebtedness, including any Credit

Facilities, may contain prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or
an Asset Sale. In addition, the exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require the Issuer to offer to
repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale may cause a default under these other agreements,
even if the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the
Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the
Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees—The
Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes if it experiences a change of control.”

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer elects to redeem less than all of the notes at any time, the notes will be selected for redemption as

follows:

(1) in accordance with the procedures of DTC and in compliance with the requirements of the applicable stock

exchange to the extent the notes are held in the form of Global Notes; or

(2) to the extent the notes are not held in the form of Global Notes, on a pro rata basis or by lot to the extent the

notes are held in definitive form.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail to

holders of certificated notes (or otherwise transmitted to registered holders of Global Notes in accordance with
applicable procedures of the depositary) at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each
holder of notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60
days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the indenture.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the portion

of the principal amount of that note that is to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed


-----

portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note.
Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Changes in Covenants and Collateral When Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

In the event of the occurrence of a Fall Away Event (and notwithstanding the failure of the Issuer subsequently

to maintain an Investment Grade Rating), the covenants and provisions described below shall each no longer be in
effect for the remaining term of the notes:

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(6) clause (4) of the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”

In addition, from and after the occurrence of a Fall Away Event, the notes will no longer be secured by any

Collateral, and the Note Guarantors will no longer Guarantee the notes.

**_Restricted Payments_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Parent or any of its

Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger
or consolidation involving the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the
Parent’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than (a) dividends or
distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent or (b) to the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent or (c) dividends or other payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary on
a pro rata basis to the holders of such class of Equity Interests (or more favorable to the Parent or applicable
Restricted Subsidiary that is the parent thereof));

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with

any merger or consolidation involving the Parent) any Equity Interests of the Parent;

(3) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled

repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor with an
outstanding principal amount equal or greater to the greater (a) $110.0 million and (b) 20% of LTM Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the notes or a Note Guarantee, except
(i) from the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent or (ii) the purchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement of any such Indebtedness made in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment;

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as

“Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(a) in the case of any Restricted Payment of the types described in (1), (2) or (3) above, no Event of Default has

occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;


-----

(b) the Issuer would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such

Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to
incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described below under
the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock;” and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the

Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clause (24)
(without duplication), but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is
less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(i) the greater of $220.0 million and 40.0% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA; plus

(ii) an amount (which amount shall not be less than zero) equal to 50.0% of Consolidated Net Income of

the Parent for the cumulative period from January 1, 2024 to and including the last day of the most recently
ended fiscal quarter of the Parent prior to such date for which consolidated financial statements required
pursuant to “—Reports” have been delivered or, at the Parent’s election, are internally available (treated as one
accounting period); plus

(iii) 100% of the aggregate amount of any capital contributions to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary

received as cash equity and the cash proceeds of any issuance or sale of Capital Stock of the Parent (other than,
in each case, any amounts (w) relied on to incur Indebtedness pursuant to clause (21) under the second
paragraph under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock,” (x) constituting an Available Excluded Contribution Amount or proceeds of an issuance of Disqualified
Stock, (y) received from the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or (z) consisting of the proceeds of any loan or
advance made pursuant to clause (7)(ii) of the definition of “Permitted Investments”), plus the fair market value,
as determined by the Parent in good faith, of Cash Equivalents, marketable securities or other property received
by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary as a capital contribution or received by the Parent in return for any
issuance or sale of Capital Stock of the Parent (other than, in each case, any amounts (w) relied on to incur
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (21) under the second paragraph under the caption “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,” (x) constituting an Available Excluded
Contribution Amount or proceeds of any issuance of Disqualified Stock or (y) received from the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, during the period from and including the Issue Date through and including
such time; plus

(iv) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, of

the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary issued after the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness or such Disqualified
Stock issued to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary), which has been converted into or exchanged for
Capital Stock of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that does not constitute Disqualified Stock, together
with the fair market value of any cash or Cash Equivalents (as determined by the Parent in good faith) and the
fair market value (as determined by the Parent in good faith) of any property or assets received by the Parent or
such Restricted Subsidiary upon such exchange or conversion, in each case, during the period from and
including the Issue Date through and including such time; plus

(v) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary during the

period from and including the Issue Date through and including such time in connection with the disposition to
any Person (other than the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary) of any Investment made pursuant to this
paragraph; plus

(vi) to the extent not already reflected as a return of capital with respect to such Investment for purposes of

determining the amount of such Investment, the proceeds received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
during the period from and including the Issue Date through and including such time in connection with cash
returns, cash profits, cash distributions and similar cash amounts, including cash principal repayments of loans
and interest payments on loans, in each case received in respect of any Investment made on or after the Issue
Date pursuant to this paragraph or, without duplication, otherwise received by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any proceeds received on account of any issuance of
Capital Stock by any Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than solely on account of the issuance of Capital Stock to
the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary)); plus


-----

(vii) an amount equal to the sum of (A) the amount of any Investments by the Parent or any Restricted

Subsidiary pursuant to this paragraph in any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Joint Venture that is not a
Restricted Subsidiary that has been merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or into, or is liquidated, wound
up or dissolved into, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B) to the extent that the Parent’s or a
Restricted Subsidiary’s Investments in any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Joint Venture have been made
pursuant to this paragraph, the fair market value (as determined by the Parent in good faith) of the property or
assets of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Joint Venture that is not a Restricted Subsidiary that have been
transferred, conveyed or otherwise distributed to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, during
the period from and including the Issue Date through and including such time; plus

(viii) the amount of any Declined Asset Sale Proceeds.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Capital Stock

held by any Permitted Payee:

(A) with Cash and Cash Equivalents, in an aggregate amount not to exceed (x) the greater of

$30.0 million and 5.0% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in any fiscal year, which, if not
used in any fiscal year, may be carried forward to the immediately succeeding fiscal year (and
deemed first applied in such subsequent fiscal year);

(B) with the proceeds of any sale or issuance of, or of any capital contribution in respect of,

provisions of this covenant permitting such Restricted Payment.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified

than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (36) above, or is entitled to be incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on
the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that
complies with this covenant. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to
one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement
outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on clause (1) of the
definition of Permitted Debt.

In addition, for purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” covenant, the Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may elect to treat
all or any portion of the commitment under any Indebtedness (including with respect to any revolving loan
commitment) as being incurred at the time of such commitment, in which case any subsequent incurrence of
Indebtedness under such commitment shall not be deemed to be an incurrence at such subsequent time.

**_Liens_**

Prior to a Fall Away Event, the Parent will not, and will not permit any of the other Note Guarantors to, directly or

indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except a Permitted Lien) of any kind securing
indebtedness (any such Lien, an “Initial Lien”) on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, which constitutes
Collateral.

Prior to a Fall Away Event, the Parent will not, and will not permit any of the other Note Guarantors to, directly

or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except a Permitted Lien) of any kind securing
indebtedness (any such Lien, an “Initial Lien”) on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, which does not
constitute Collateral, unless:

(i) In the case of any Initial Lien securing an Obligation that ranks pari passu with the notes or the Note

Guarantees, effective provision is made to secure the notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be, at
least equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to) the Obligations secured by such Initial Lien until
such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by such Initial Lien; and

(ii) In the case of any Initial Lien securing an Obligation that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes or

the Note Guarantees, effective provision is made to secure the notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case
may be, with a Lien on the same properties or assets of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, that is prior to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation.

Any Lien created for the benefit of holders pursuant to the last clause of the preceding paragraph shall provide

by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without any action
on the part of the holders, upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

From and after the occurrence of a Fall Away Event, the Parent will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to,

incur any Lien securing Indebtedness on any Property (except a Post-Release Permitted Lien), unless the notes or
the Note Guarantees are secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligations secured by such Lien. Any
Lien created for the benefit of holders pursuant to this paragraph shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without any action on the part of the holders, upon the
release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or

permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any such Restricted
Subsidiary to:


-----

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Parent or any of its Restricted

Subsidiaries or pay any indebtedness owed to the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially
more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained
in those agreements on the Issue Date;

(2) the indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Credit Facilities or letters of credit incurred under clauses (1),

(18), (24), (25) or (35) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” (or any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof not prohibited by the
indenture);

contracts with foreign governments or agencies thereof entered into in the ordinary course of business;

its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was
incurred, or such Capital Stock was issued, in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the
Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired, and any amendments, modifications, restatements,
renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with
respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the
acquisition; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was not prohibited by the terms of the
indenture to be incurred;

(6) customary non-assignment provisions in leases, contracts and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of

(9) any agreement or instrument governing Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained

Indebtedness being refinanced;

(10) Permitted Liens securing Indebtedness that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to

such Liens;

(11) provisions in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale and lease-back agreements, stock sale

IP Rights);

(19) restrictions in any Hedge Agreement, any agreement relating to Banking Services and/or any agreement

relating to Permitted Treasury Arrangements; and

(20) other restrictions or encumbrances which would (in the judgment of the Issuer) not reasonably be expected

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Parent and the Issuer may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate, amalgamate, or merge with or into

another Person (whether or not the Parent or the Issuer is the surviving Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Parent or the Issuer is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such

consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if other than the Parent or the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is organized and validly existing under the laws of the U.S.,
any state of the U.S. or the District of Columbia or under the laws of Canada or any province thereof, the United
Kingdom, any member state of the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any
Channel Island or Switzerland;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if other than the

Parent or the Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been
made expressly assumes all the obligations of the Parent or the Issuer under the notes or Note Guarantee (as
applicable), the indenture and the Collateral Documents;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists; and


-----

(4) in the case of the Parent, either (a) the Parent or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,

amalgamation, or merger (if other than the Parent) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition has been made will, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related
financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be
permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, or (b) the Parent or the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation amalgamation, or merger (if other than the Parent) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction after
giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable four-quarter period, have an Interest Coverage Ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries
that would be equal to or greater than such ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to
such action or have a Total Leverage Ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries that would be equal to or
lower than such ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such action.

In addition, the Parent may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in

one or more related transactions, to any other Person.

The Parent will not permit any Note Guarantor to, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate, amalgamate, or merge

with or into another Person; or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose (collectively “dispose”) of all
or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to another Person unless:

(1) except in the case of a Note Guarantor (x) that has disposed of all or substantially all of its assets, whether

through a merger, amalgamation, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets or (y) that, as a result of the
disposition of all or a portion of its Capital Stock, ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Parent, in both cases in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders—Asset Sales,” the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such Note Guarantor) shall expressly assume, by a Note Guarantee
agreement and Collateral Documents, all the obligations of such Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; and

(2) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into

or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Note Guarantor and (B) the Parent or the Issuer
may merge or amalgamate with an Affiliate of the Parent solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Parent or the
Issuer in another jurisdiction within the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province thereof, the United Kingdom, any member state of the European Union as in effect on the
Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any Channel Island, Singapore or Switzerland or converting the Parent or the
Issuer into a limited liability company organized under the United States of America, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia, Canada or any province thereof, the United Kingdom, any member state of the European Union as in
effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any Channel Island, Singapore or Switzerland.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the indenture, the Parent may consummate a Permitted

Reorganization. If in connection with such Permitted Reorganization, a new company is created that directly or
indirectly wholly owns the Parent, then, so long as such new company is an obligor on the notes (as an issuer or
Note Guarantor), the Parent may choose to have the covenants in the indenture apply from and after such time to
such new company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, rather than to the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and all
references thereafter in “Certain Covenants” to the Parent shall refer to such company.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,

lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or
for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in
excess of the greater of $45.0 million and 7.5% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not substantially less favorable to the Parent or such Restricted

Subsidiary, as the case may be (as determined by the Issuer in good faith), than those that might be obtained at the
time in a comparable arm’s-length transaction from a Person who is not an Affiliate; and


-----

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate

consideration in excess of $200.0 million, such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Parent.

The following items will be deemed not to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the

provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any transaction between or among the Parent or one or more Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) any issuance, sale or grant of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or

otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans
approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) (i) any collective bargaining, employment, indemnification, expense reimbursement or severance

agreement or compensatory (including profit sharing) arrangement entered into by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary with any Permitted Payee, (ii) any subscription agreement or similar agreement pertaining to the
repurchase of Capital Stock pursuant to put/call rights or similar rights with any Permitted Payee and (iii)
payments or other transactions pursuant to any management equity plan, employee compensation, benefit plan,
stock option plan or arrangement, equity holder arrangement, supplemental executive retirement benefit plan, any
health, disability or similar insurance plan, or any employment contract or arrangement which covers any
Permitted Payee and payments pursuant thereto;

(4) (i) any Restricted Payment or Investment permitted by the indenture and (ii) any transaction

specifically permitted by clauses (5), (23) and (26) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” or by the second paragraph
under the caption “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” (iii) any
Permitted Reorganization and (iv) issuances of Capital Stock and issuances and incurrences of indebtedness not
restricted by the indenture and payments pursuant hereto;

(5) the existence of, or performance by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of their obligations under

the terms of, any transaction or agreement in existence on the Issue Date, and any amendment, modification or
extension thereof to the extent such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not materially (i)
adverse to the holders of the notes or (ii) more disadvantageous to the holders of the notes than the relevant
transaction in existence on the Issue Date, as applicable;

(6) (i) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Parent solely because the Parent or any

Restricted Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly through a Restricted Subsidiary, Capital Stock in, or controls,
such Person or Controls such Person and (ii) transactions with any Person that is an Affiliate solely because a
director or officer of such Person is a director or officer of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary and (iii)
transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Parent or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries, where such Affiliates receive the same consideration as non-Affiliates in such
transactions;

(7) any transaction or transactions approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of

Directors of the Parent at such time;

(8) Guarantees not prohibited by “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or

Preferred Stock” or “—Restricted Payments”;

(9) [reserved];

(10) (i) the payment of customary compensation and fees and reasonable out-of-pocket costs to, and

indemnities provided on behalf of, current and former members of the Board of Directors, officers, employees,
members of management, managers, consultants and independent contractors of the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries; or (ii) issuances or sales of Qualified Capital Stock of the Parent to Affiliates or employees of or
consultants to the Parent;

(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, licensees, Joint Ventures, purchasers or sellers of goods

or services or providers of employees or other labor entered into in the ordinary course of business, which are (i)


-----

fair to the Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary in the good faith determination of the Issuer or (ii) on
terms not substantially less favorable to the Parent and/or its applicable Restricted Subsidiary as might reasonably
be obtained from a Person other than an Affiliate;

(12) the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses related to registration rights and

indemnities provided to shareholders under any shareholder agreement and the existence or performance by the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any such registration rights or shareholder agreement;

(13) (i) any purchase by the Parent of the Capital Stock of (or contribution to the equity capital of) the

Parent and (ii) any intercompany loans made by Parent to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(14) any transaction in respect of which the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a

letter from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing stating that such
transaction is fair to the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the
terms, when taken as a whole, are not substantially less favorable to the Parent or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary than might be obtained at the time in a comparable arm’s length transaction from a Person who is not
an Affiliate;

(15) payments to or from, and transactions with, an Unrestricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of

business (including, any cash management or administrative activities related thereto);

(16) any lease entered into between the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of

the Parent, as lessor, and any transaction(s) pursuant to that lease, which lease is approved by a majority of the
disinterested members of the board of directors or senior management of the Parent in good faith;

(17) transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of business pursuant to membership in a purchasing

consortium;

(18) transactions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Facility, including any customary

transactions with (including any investment in or related to) any Receivables Entity; and

(19) any employment agreement or benefit or similar plan entered into by the Parent or any of its Restricted

Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary.

**Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries

will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture and will not Guarantee the notes. Following
the Issue Date, the Parent’s Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) to be
an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. Any designation of a Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries. Following the Issue Date, if a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments (calculated after giving effect to any concurrent
transactions) owned by the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount
available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or
under one or more of the clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent. That
designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent’s Board of Directors may redesignate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default; provided that
such redesignation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness and, if applicable, an incurrence of related
Liens by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent of any outstanding Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such redesignation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness and, if applicable,
related Liens are permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and, if applicable, “—Certain Covenants—
Liens” (other than clause (14) under the definition of Permitted Liens), calculated, if applicable, on a pro forma basis
as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period.

**Reports**

Whether or not required by the SEC’s rules and regulations, so long as any notes are outstanding, the Parent

will furnish (to the extent not publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR system (or any successor system)) to the
holders of notes by posting on the Parent’s website (in a format that is accessible to holders of notes as well as
prospective holders of notes), within the time periods specified below:

(1) within 105 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Parent ending thereafter, a consolidated

statement of financial position of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal year, and the related
consolidated statements of income (or loss) or operations and cash flows for such fiscal year, together with
related notes thereto, in comparative form the figures for the previous fiscal year, in reasonable detail and all
prepared in accordance with IFRS in all material respects, audited and accompanied by a report and opinion of
an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing;

(2) within 60 days after the end of each quarter of each fiscal year of the Parent (other than any fiscal

quarter ended on the last day of a fiscal year), a consolidated statement of financial position of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal period, and the related (a) consolidated statement of income for the first
two fiscal quarters and the current fiscal period and (b) consolidated statement of cash flows for the period then
ended, and setting forth, commencing with such financial statements delivered for the first fiscal period
following the first full fiscal year of the Parent following the Issue Date, in each case of the preceding clauses
(a) and (b), in comparative form the figures for the corresponding fiscal period of the previous fiscal year; and

(3) concurrently with the delivery of the financial statements set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above, a

narrative report prepared by management of the Parent describing the results of operations in a form
customarily prepared by management of the Parent (provided that such narrative report need not comply with
disclosure requirements under Regulation S-K);

_provided, however, that such reports required pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) above (a) shall not be required to_

comply with Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or related
Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K, or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K (with respect to any non-IFRS financial
measures contained therein), (b) shall not be required to include any exhibits that would have been required to be
filed pursuant to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, except for agreements evidencing material Indebtedness (excluding
any schedules thereto), (c) shall not be required to include any trade secrets or other confidential information that is
competitively sensitive in the good faith and reasonable determination of the Issuer and (d) solely if and to the extent
that the applicable deadline required by the SEC or NYSE for delivery of the Parent’s Form 6-K and/or 20-F (as
applicable) for any period are later than the applicable deadlines for delivery set forth in clauses (1) and (2) (as in
effect immediately prior such time) for such period, such deadlines set forth in clauses (1) and (2) shall
automatically be deemed to be replaced with such later deadlines as required by the SEC or NYSE (without any
further action or consent of any party to the indenture).

The requirement to furnish any of the reports required pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) may be satisfied by the

posting of such reports within the time periods specified above on a password protected online data system requiring
user identification and a confidentiality acknowledgement (the “Secured System”). If the Parent uses the Secured
System to satisfy such requirements, it shall make readily and promptly available any password or other login
information relating to the Secured System to holders, prospective investors, security analysts who have certified to
the Parent that they are reputable security analysts employed by a reputable financial institution who regularly cover
or intend to cover the Parent and the notes (each, a “Security Analyst”) and market makers who have certified to the
Parent that they are reputable market makers who regularly make or intend to make a market in the notes (each, a
“Market Maker”), and shall make readily and promptly available on an “Investor Relations” page on its external
website contact information for being provided access to the Secured System to any holders, prospective investors,
Security Analysts or Market Makers and promptly comply with any such requests for access to the Secured System
to the extent provided for herein.

The Parent shall furnish to holders and prospective investors, upon their request, any information required to be

delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of this covenant if

it or any Parent Entity files with the SEC the reports, documents and information pursuant to the reporting


-----

requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case within the applicable time periods
specified by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and NYSE (including any applicable grace periods);
_provided, that in the case of any such Parent Entity, either (i) such Parent Entity (or any other Parent Entity that is a_
subsidiary of such Parent Entity) has no material third party Indebtedness and/or material operations (as determined
by the Parent in good faith and other than any Indebtedness or operations that are attributable solely to such Parent
Entity’s ownership of the Parent and its subsidiaries) or (ii) if there are material differences between the financial
statements of such Parent Entity and its consolidated subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries, on the other hand, such financial statements or the Form 20-F or Form 6-K, as applicable,
shall be accompanied by consolidating information (which need not be audited) that summarizes in reasonable detail
the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating
to the Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Parent to comply with any of its obligations

under the indenture for purposes of clause (4) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will not constitute an
Event of Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder. To the extent
any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—Certain Covenants— Reports”
and such information is subsequently provided, the Parent will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with
respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

**Certain Calculations**

All financial statements to be delivered pursuant to the indenture shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS

and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature that are used in
calculating the Total Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with IFRS.

All terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts

and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to (i) any election under Accounting Standards
Codification 825-10-25 (previously referred to as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 159) (or any other
Accounting Standards Codification, International Accounting Standard or Financial Accounting Standard having a
similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Parent or any Subsidiary at “fair value,”
as defined therein, (ii) any treatment of Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under Accounting
Standards Codification 470-20 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification, International Accounting Standard
or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or
bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal
amount thereof and (iii) the application of Accounting Standards Codification 480, 815, 805 and 718 (to the extent
these pronouncements under Accounting Standards Codification 718 result in recording an equity award as a
liability on the consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the circumstance where,
but for the application of the pronouncements, such award would have been classified as equity) (or any other
Accounting Standards Codification, International Accounting Standard or Financial Accounting Standard having a
similar result or effect). If the Parent notifies the Trustee that the Parent is required to report under GAAP or has
elected to do so through an early adoption policy, “IFRS” shall mean generally accepted accounting principles
pursuant to GAAP (provided thereafter, the Parent cannot elect to report under IFRS); provided, that any calculation
or determination in the indenture that requires the application of IFRS for periods that include fiscal quarters or
halves ended prior to the application of GAAP will remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance
with IFRS.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs of

this section, all financial ratios and tests based on the Total Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Interest
Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA contained in the indenture that are calculated with respect to
any period during which any Subject Transaction occurs shall be calculated with respect to such period and such
Subject Transaction on a Pro Forma Basis. Further, if since the beginning of any such period and on or prior to the
date of any required calculation of any financial ratio, test or amount (x) any Subject Transaction has occurred or (y)
any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or
into the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period has consummated any Subject
Transaction, then, in each case, any applicable financial ratio, test or amount shall be calculated on a Pro Forma
Basis for such period as if such Subject Transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period (or, in the


-----

case of any determination pertaining to the balance sheet, including the acquisition of Cash and Cash Equivalents, as
of the last day of such period).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the first paragraph above or in the definition of “Finance

Lease”, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, all obligations of any Person that are or would have been treated as
operating leases for purposes of IFRS prior to the issuance by the International Accounting Standards Board (the
“IASB”) on January 1, 2019 of IRFS 16 shall continue to be accounted for as operating leases (and not be treated as
financing or capital lease obligations or Indebtedness) for purposes of all financial definitions, calculations and
deliverables under the indenture and any Collateral Document (including the calculation of Consolidated Net
Income and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA) (whether or not such operating lease obligations were in effect on
such date) notwithstanding the fact that such obligations are required in accordance with the IASB or any other
change in accounting treatment or otherwise (on a prospective or retroactive basis or otherwise) to be treated as or to
be recharacterized as financing or capital lease obligations or otherwise accounted for as liabilities in financial
statements.

For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a

calculation of any financial ratio or financial test (including any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage
Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) and/or the amount of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA,
Consolidated Net Income, such financial ratio, financial test or amount shall, subject to the next paragraph below, be
calculated at the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event
occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of
a change in such financial ratio, financial test or amount occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is
made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including in connection with any calculation made on a Pro

Forma Basis), to the extent that the terms of the indenture require (1) compliance with any financial ratio or
financial test (including, without limitation, any Secured Leverage Ratio incurrence test and any Total Leverage
Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio incurrence test) and/or any cap expressed as a percentage of
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, (2) the absence of a Default or Event of Default (or
any type of default or event of default) or (3) compliance with any basket or other condition, as a condition to (a) the
consummation of any acquisition or similar Investment, and/or (b) the making of any Restricted Payment, the
determination of whether the relevant condition is satisfied may be made, at the election of the Issuer, (i) in the case
of any acquisition or similar Investment, any Asset Sale, any incurrence of Indebtedness or any transaction relating
thereto, at the time of (or on the basis of the financial statements for the most recently ended four quarter period
available at the time of) either (x) the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to such acquisition,
consolidation, business combination, similar Investment or Asset Sale (or, solely in connection with an acquisition,
consolidation or business combination to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies,
the date on which a “Rule 2.7 Announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer is made) or the establishment of a
commitment with respect to such Indebtedness or (y) the consummation of such acquisition or similar Investment,
(ii) in the case of any Restricted Payment, at the time of (or on the basis of the financial statements for the most
recently ended four quarter period available at the time of) (x) the declaration of, or delivery of any required notice
of redemption or prepayment with respect to, as applicable, such Restricted Payment or (y) the making of such
Restricted Payment, in each case, after giving effect on a pro forma basis to the relevant acquisition, consolidation,
business combination or similar Investment and/or Restricted Payment (including the intended use of proceeds of
any Indebtedness to be incurred in connection therewith), and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to
have occurred solely as a result of an adverse change in such ratio, test or condition occurring after the time such
election is made (but any subsequent improvement in the applicable ratio, test or amount may be utilized by the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary). If the Parent has elected to test the permissibility of any transaction as provided
above prior to the consummation of such transaction, then prior to the completion of such transaction (or the
abandonment of such transaction), all future incurrence tests will be made on a Pro Forma Basis for such transaction
and all related transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer shall have elected any option set forth in this
paragraph in respect of any transaction, then the Parent or its applicable Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted to
consummate such transaction even if any applicable test or condition shall cease to be satisfied subsequent to the
Issuer’s election of such option.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless the Issuer otherwise elects, with respect to any amounts

incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the indenture that does not
require compliance with a financial ratio or financial test (including any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total


-----

Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, and any cap expressed as a
percentage of Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, the “Fixed Amounts”) substantially
concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of
the indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or financial test (including any Secured Leverage Ratio
test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the “IncurrenceBased Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that (A) the incurrence of the Incurrence-Based Amount shall be
calculated first without giving effect to any Fixed Amount but giving full pro forma effect to the use of proceeds of
such Fixed Amount and the related transactions and (B) the incurrence of the Fixed Amount shall be calculated
thereafter. Unless the Issuer elects otherwise, the Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to
have used amounts under an Incurrence-Based Amount then available to the Parent or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary prior to utilization of any amount under a Fixed Amount then available to the Issuer.

The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting

Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Parent
dated such date prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Any increase in any amount of Indebtedness or any increase in any amount secured by any Lien by virtue of the

accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or a dividend in the form of additional
Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount and/or any increase in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
solely as a result of any fluctuation in the exchange rate of any applicable currency shall be deemed to be permitted
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” without utilizing any basket thereunder and
will be deemed not to be the granting of a Lien for purposes of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Liens”.

For purposes of determining compliance with the covenants described under the captions “—Certain

Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and “—Certain
Covenants—Liens”, if any Indebtedness or Lien is incurred in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a
percentage of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (including a ratio based on Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA), and
any refinancing or replacement thereof would cause the percentage of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to be
exceeded if calculated based on the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA on the date of such refinancing or replacement,
such percentage of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA will be deemed not to be exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness or other obligation does not exceed an amount sufficient to
repay the principal amount of such Indebtedness or other obligation being refinanced or replaced, except by an
amount equal to (x) unpaid accrued interest, penalties and premiums (including tender, prepayment or repayment
premiums) thereon plus underwriting discounts and other customary fees, commissions and expenses (including
upfront fees, original issue discount or initial yield payment) incurred in connection with such refinancing or
replacement and (y) additional amounts permitted to be incurred under the covenant described under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” (subject to
utilization of such amounts).

Any financial ratios required to satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under the indenture shall

be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more
than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest
number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” with respect to the notes:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the notes;

(2) default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the notes;

(3) failure by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (a) to comply with the provisions described under

the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders,” which failure remains uncured for 30 days after written
notice to the Issuer from the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee from the holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the notes, or (b) to comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;


-----

(4) failure by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days (or 120 days in the case of the

provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports”) after written notice to the Issuer from the Trustee or to
the Issuer and the Trustee from the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the notes to comply with any of
the other agreements in the indenture or the Collateral Documents;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there

may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) (other than
Indebtedness held exclusively by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee
now exists or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal when due on such Indebtedness within any applicable grace

period provided in such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates to the greater of $110.0 million and 20.0% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA or more;

(6) failure by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating

in excess of the greater of $110.0 million and 20.0% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which judgments are
not paid, discharged, stayed or subject to insurance for a period of 60 days after becoming final;

(7) any Note Guarantee by the Parent or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect in all

material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Note Guarantor that is the Parent or a
Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms such Note Guarantor’s obligations under the indenture or any Note
Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice as specified in the indenture;

(8) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents, liens

with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable, or the Issuer shall assert or
any Note Guarantor shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such security
interests are invalid or unenforceable and, in the case of any such Note Guarantor, the Issuer fails to cause such Note
Guarantor to rescind such assertions within 30 days after the Issuer has actual knowledge of such assertions; or

(9) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation described in the indenture with respect to the Parent,

the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
when taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the

Issuer, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other
Event of Default with respect to the notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any
action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice

of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (other than
any holder that is a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation
from each such holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its
nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that
they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction
relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or
otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of
providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position
Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the
holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be
provided by the beneficial owner of such notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to


-----

conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the
Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder providing such Noteholder
Direction was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee (i)
an officer’s certificate certifying that the Issuer has (x) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more
Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant
and (ii) evidence that the Issuer has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that
such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any
Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event
of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the
notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee such officer’s certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach
of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction
being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of notes held by the
remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such
Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity and/or security
such Directing Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect
that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its
Verification Covenant (and the Issuer has not determined in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe
such Verification Covenant has not been satisfied as set forth above), then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the
above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of holders
required under the indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if
applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken
or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall not
apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank; provided that if a Regulated Bank is a Directing Holder or a beneficial
owner directing DTC it shall provide a written representation to the Issuer that it is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively

rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to monitor,
investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a holder has a Net Short Position or to inquire as to or investigate the
accuracy of any Position Representation or determine whether it complies with the provisions of the indenture,
enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection
therewith, inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position
Representation, monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported, verify
any statements in any officer’s certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative
Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy, staying any
remedy or otherwise failing to act in accordance with a Noteholder Direction as provided for herein. Neither the
Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting
in good faith on a Noteholder Direction, or for determining whether any holder has delivered a Position
Representation, such Position Representation conforms with the requirements of the indenture or any other
agreement or any holder is a Regulated Bank.

Each holder by accepting a note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral

Agent (nor any agent) shall be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing
provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any officer’s certificate or (iv) its duties under the indenture, as the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion.

Holders of notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to

certain limitations, including the right to be indemnified and/or provided with security to its satisfaction, holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the Trustee with respect to the notes
in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the notes notice of any continuing
Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest) if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest.


-----

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by written notice to the

Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or
the principal of, the notes.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the indenture.

Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement
specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Foreign Currency Equivalents**

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction or amount, the U.S.

dollar equivalent principal amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency will be the Dollar Equivalent
calculated on the date the Indebtedness was incurred or other transaction was entered into; provided that if any
Refinancing Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars is incurred to refinance Indebtedness
denominated in the same currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated
restriction to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such Refinancing Indebtedness shall be
deemed not to exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other
provision in the indenture, no restriction or amount will be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies. In no event, will the Trustee or the paying agent be responsible for obtaining exchange
rates or otherwise effecting currency conversions or calculations.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Note Guarantors domiciled outside the U.S. will irrevocably appoint Amer Sports Company, One

Prudential Plaza, 130 East Randolph Street #600, Chicago, Illinois 60601, as their agent for service of process in any
suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents
brought in any Federal or state court located in New York City and each of such parties will submit to the
jurisdiction thereof.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor, as such, will

have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor under the notes, the indenture, the
Collateral Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its and the Note Guarantors’ obligations

discharged with respect to the outstanding notes and the related Note Guarantees and have Liens on the Collateral
securing the notes released (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or

premium, if any, on, the notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of notes,

mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in connection

therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Note

Guarantors with respect to the notes released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the indenture


-----

and have Liens on the Collateral securing the notes released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission
to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default with respect to the notes or an Event of Default. In the
event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment or bankruptcy or insolvency events
with respect to the Issuer) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event
of Default with respect to the notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as to the notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, cash

in U.S. dollars, U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and U.S.
dollar-denominated Government Securities, in each case in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if
any, on, the outstanding notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and
the Issuer must specify whether the notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably

acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal
income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the
beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably

acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes may have occurred and be continuing, on the date

of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance must not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a

default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the indenture) to which the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; and

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all

conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs with respect to the notes, (a) the indenture, the

notes, the Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor agreement may
be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the notes
then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, the notes), and (b) any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the indenture or
the notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding
notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, the notes).

Without the consent of each holder of notes affected thereby, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to

any notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to the

redemption of the notes (other than to provide for a shorter notice period or any other purely administrative change


-----

to the provisions with respect to the redemption of the notes, and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, provisions
relating to the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any note;

(4) make any such note payable in money other than U.S. dollars;

(5) make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of

holders of notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on notes;

(6) waive a redemption payment with respect to any note (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, a payment

required by one of the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders”);

(7) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the notes;

(8) modify the Note Guarantees with respect to the notes in any manner adverse in any material respect to the

holders of the notes (other than, with respect to the Note Guarantee of a Foreign Subsidiary, as and to the extent
necessary in order for such Foreign Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with applicable law as
more fully set forth under the caption “—Note Guarantees”); or

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

In addition, except as set forth under “—Note Guarantees,” without the consent of holders of at least 66[2]/3% in

principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, notes), (i) no amendment or supplement may release the Note
Guarantee of the Parent with respect to the notes and (ii) no amendment or supplement may modify any Collateral
Documents or the provisions in the indenture dealing with Collateral or the Collateral Documents to the extent that
such amendment or supplement would have the effect of releasing all or substantially all of the Liens securing the
notes (except as permitted by the terms of the indenture and the Collateral Documents) or change or alter the priority
of the security interests in the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of or notice to any holder of notes, the Issuer, the Trustee

and the Notes Collateral Agent (as applicable) may amend or supplement the indenture, the notes, the Collateral
Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor agreement:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Note Guarantor’s obligations to holders of notes in the

case of a consolidation or merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Note Guarantor’s assets;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of notes or that does

not adversely affect in any material respect the legal rights under the indenture of any such holder;

(5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture

under the TIA;

(6) to conform the text of the indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Documents, the First

Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor agreement to any provision of this “Description of the
Notes”;

(7) to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the indenture as

of its date;

(8) to add additional Note Guarantees with respect to the notes (including, with respect to the Note Guarantee

of a Foreign Subsidiary, any amendment or supplement to the terms of such Note Guarantee as and to the extent
necessary in order for such Foreign Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with applicable law) or to
confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any Note Guarantee with respect to the notes when
such release, termination or discharge is not prohibited under the indenture;


-----

(9) to secure the notes or the Note Guarantees or to add additional assets as Collateral;

(10) to release Collateral from the Lien pursuant to the indenture, the Collateral Documents, the First Lien

Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement when permitted or required by the indenture, the
Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or such other intercreditor agreement; or

(11) to enter into any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Parent, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent may amend the First Lien

Intercreditor Agreement, any other intercreditor agreement and the Collateral Documents to provide for the addition
of any creditors to such agreements to the extent a pari passu lien for the benefit of such creditor is not prohibited by
the terms of the indenture and may enter into an intercreditor agreement with creditors for whom a junior lien on the
Collateral is to be granted, provided the Issuer delivers an officer’s certificate to the Trustee and Notes Collateral
Agent certifying that the terms thereof are customary and that the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent are authorized
to enter into an intercreditor agreement. Upon delivery of the aforementioned officer’s certificate, the Trustee and
Notes Collateral Agent may request an opinion of counsel stating that they are authorized to enter into an
intercreditor agreement and that all conditions precedent in the indenture relating to the execution and delivery of
such Intercreditor agreement have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect with respect to the notes, and the Note

Guarantees and the Liens on the Collateral securing the notes will be released without any further action by holders,
when:

(1) either:

(a) all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or

paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by

reason of the mailing or transmission of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable
within one year and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust
funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable U.S. dollardenominated Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable U.S. dollardenominated Government Securities, in each case in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the notes not delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption,
_provided that with respect to any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount_
deposited shall be sufficient for purpose of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
Applicable Premium deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the notes on the date of the

deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit;

(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to the notes under the indenture;

and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the indenture to apply the deposited

money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that

all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.


-----

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer, the indenture limits its right to obtain payment of claims in

certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time,

method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee with respect to
the notes, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in
the conduct of such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any holder of notes, unless such holder has
offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or
expense (including attorney’s fees and expenses).

The Trustee shall not be responsible to make any calculation with respect to any matter under the indenture.

**Governing Law**

The indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents will be governed by the laws of the

State of New York; provided that certain of the Collateral Documents will be governed by the laws of other
jurisdictions to the extent that (i) the validity, perfection, effect of perfection or of non-perfection or priority of the
security interests granted thereunder are governed by such other jurisdictions pursuant to applicable conflict of laws
principles or (ii) such approach is consistent with the security interests granted with respect to the Credit Agreement
or with applicable commercial practice.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this offering memorandum may obtain a copy of the indenture without charge by writing

to Amer Sports, Inc., Konepajankuja 6 00511 Helsinki Finland, Attention: Investors Relations.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

The notes will be represented by one or more notes in registered global form, without interest coupons attached.

On the date of closing, these global notes (the “Global Notes”) will remain in the custody of the Trustee and
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant
in DTC as described below.

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another

nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants, including,
if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream, which may change from time to time. Beneficial interests in the
Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form except in the limited circumstances described
below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.”

**_Depository Procedures_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided

solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its

participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its
participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly


-----

or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own
securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership
interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the
records of the participants and indirect participants.

DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants with portions of the principal

amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these

interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the participants) or by the
participants and the indirect participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly

through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly
through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank
S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC.

Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements

of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of
securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons
will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to
Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be
affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names,

will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or
“holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the

name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture.
Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes,
including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for
all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or payments

made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership
interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect

participants.

DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as

the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant
participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants
to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants in
identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.


-----

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be

settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Cross-market transfers between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and DTC participants acting on behalf

of Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s
rules on behalf of DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be; however, such
cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by
the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines
(Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its
settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the DTC participant acting on its behalf to take action to effect final
settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or
receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC.
Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC participants
acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of

one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes
for notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of

interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither the
Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**_Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes_**

A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive notes in registered certificated form, or “Certificated Notes,” if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (b)

has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, the Issuer fails to appoint a
successor depositary; or

(2) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default.

In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes

will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the
depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures), and the Certificated Notes shall bear appropriate legends
indicating the transfer restrictions applicable thereto.

**_Same Day Settlement and Payment_**

The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal,

premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to
Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the
Certificated Notes, in the case of a holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of $1.0 million or more,
or, if no such account is specified or in the case of a holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of less
than $1.0 million, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by the Global
Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted
secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately
available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in
immediately available funds.


-----

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an

interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a
business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised
the Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement
date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day
for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Similar Laws (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit

certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under
ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority, responsibility or control over the
administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders
investment advice to an ERISA Plan for a fee or other compensation, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the
ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes by any Plan, fiduciaries should determine whether the investment is in

accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Similar Laws.

Each Plan should consider the fact that no Transaction Party is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with

respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes in connection with the initial offering of the notes. The
Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular
investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes
in connection with the initial offering of the notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the
Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific
purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the notes for any
specific purchaser.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified

transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of an ERISA
Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is

considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard,
the DOL has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and/or
holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting transactions involving
insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting transactions involving bank collective
investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting transactions involving insurance company general accounts and PTCE
96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code, respectively, for the purchase and sale of securities, provided that neither the issuer of the
securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or


-----

renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided
_further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the_
transaction. There can be no assurance that any such exemptions will be available, or that all of the conditions of any
such exemptions will be satisfied, with respect to the transactions involving the notes.

Governmental plans, certain church plans, non-U.S. plans and other plans, while not subject to the fiduciary

responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions described above, may
nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel regarding
the potential consequences of an investment in the notes under any applicable Similar Laws before purchasing any
notes.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any

Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA or the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

By its acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and

warranted that either (i) such purchaser or subsequent transferee is not, and is not acting on behalf of or using the
assets of, a Plan or (ii) the purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of a note by such purchaser or transferee
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary of such
purchaser or transferee with respect to the purchase and holding of a note in connection with the initial offering of
the notes.

The foregoing discussion is merely a summary and should not be construed as legal advice or as complete in all

relevant respects. The foregoing discussion is based on laws in effect on the date of this offering memorandum and
is subject to any subsequent changes therein. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or
other persons considering investing in the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their
counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to the
acquisition, holding and disposition of the notes. Acceptance of a note on behalf of a Plan is in no respect a
representation by the Transaction Parties that such investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by Plans generally or a particular Plan or that such investment is appropriate for Plans generally or a
particular Plan.

**MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes

purchased in this offering at the “issue price,” which is the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is
sold to the public for cash, and held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This discussion also does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your

particular circumstances, including any alternative minimum tax consequences, Medicare contribution tax
consequences, the application of Section 451 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) with
respect to conforming the timing of income accruals to financial statements, as well as differing tax consequences
that may apply if you are, for instance:

  - a financial institution;

  - a regulated investment company;

  - a dealer or trader in securities that uses a mark-to-market method of accounting;

  - holding notes as part of a “straddle” or integrated transaction;

  - a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

  - a tax-exempt entity; or

  - a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your

partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your activities.

This summary is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and

proposed Treasury Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this offering memorandum may
affect the tax consequences described herein. This summary does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S.
taxation, or any taxes other than income taxes. You should consult your tax adviser with regard to the application of
the U.S. federal tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

**Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a U.S. Holder. You are a U.S. Holder if for U.S. federal income tax

purposes you are a beneficial owner of a note and are:

  - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

  - a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or

  - an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

**_Certain Additional Payments_**

There are circumstances in which the Issuer might be required to make payments on a note that would increase

the yield of the note, for instance, as described under “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of the
Holders—Change of Control”. We intend to take the position that the possibility of such payments does not result in
the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our
position is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). If the IRS takes a contrary position, you may be
required to accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury Regulations)
determined at the time of issuance of the notes (which is not expected to differ significantly from the actual yield on
the notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments
based on the comparable yield. In addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable


-----

disposition of the notes would be treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. You should consult your tax
adviser regarding the tax consequences if the notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Stated interest on a note will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the time it accrues or is received,

in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and this
discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the

difference between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the
note. Your tax basis in a note will generally equal the cost of your note[.] For these purposes, the amount realized
does not include any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which is treated as described under
“Payments of Interest” above.

Gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a note will generally be capital gain or loss and

will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other taxable disposition the note has been held for
more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate taxpayers are subject to reduced tax rates.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a Non-U.S. Holder. You are a Non-U.S. Holder if for U.S. federal income

tax purposes you are a beneficial owner of a note that is:

  - a nonresident alien individual;

  - a foreign corporation; or

  - a foreign estate or trust.

You are not a Non-U.S. Holder if you are a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183

days or more in the taxable year of disposition, or if you are a former citizen or former resident of the United States,
in either of which cases you should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
owning or disposing of a note.

**_Payments on the Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below under “FATCA” payments of principal and interest on the notes by the Issuer or

any paying agent to you will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided that, in the case of
interest,

  - you do not own, actually or constructively, ten percent or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock of the Issuer entitled to vote;

  - you are not a controlled foreign corporation related, directly or indirectly, to the Issuer through stock
ownership;

  - you certify on a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form), under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person; and

  - interest on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States as described below.


-----

If you cannot satisfy the first three requirements described above and interest on the notes is not exempt from

withholding because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States as
described below, payments of interest on the notes will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless
the Non-U.S. Holder qualifies for a reduced rate under an applicable treaty. To claim such treaty entitlement, you
must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other
applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an
income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

You generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on gain realized on a sale,

redemption or other taxable disposition of notes, unless the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a
trade or business in the United States as described below, although any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest will be treated as described above under “Payments on the Notes.”

**_Effectively Connected Income_**

If interest or gain on a note is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States

(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base
maintained by you), you will generally be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. Holder (see “Tax Consequences to
U.S. Holders” above). In this case, you will be exempt from the withholding tax on interest discussed above,
although you will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim an exemption
from withholding. You should consult your tax adviser with respect to other U.S. tax consequences of the ownership
and disposition of notes, including the possible imposition of a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty
rate) if you are a corporation.

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

If you are a U.S. Holder, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with payments

on the notes and proceeds received from a sale or other disposition of the notes unless you are an exempt recipient.
You may also be subject to backup withholding on these payments in respect of your notes unless you provide your
taxpayer identification number and otherwise comply with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules
or you provide proof of an applicable exemption.

If you are Non-U.S. Holder, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with

payments of interest on the notes. Unless you comply with certification procedures to establish that you are not a
United States person, information returns may also be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a sale
or other disposition of a note. You may be subject to backup withholding on payments on the notes or on the
proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the notes unless you comply with certification procedures to establish
that you are not a United States person or otherwise establish an exemption. The certification procedures required to
claim the exemption from withholding tax on interest described above will satisfy the certification requirements
necessary to avoid backup withholding as well.

Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited

against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**FATCA**

Provisions commonly referred to as “FATCA” impose withholding of 30% on payments of interest on the notes

and of gross proceeds of sales or redemptions of the notes to “foreign financial institutions” (which is broadly
defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless
various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons
of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies. If FATCA withholding
is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of any
amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden).
Proposed U.S. Treasury regulations (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them
pending finalization) eliminate the withholding requirement on payments of gross proceeds (other than amounts
treated as interest). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of FATCA on their
investment in the notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Note Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers named below have entered into a purchase agreement

with respect to the notes. Subject to certain conditions, each Initial Purchaser has severally agreed to purchase the
principal amount of notes indicated in the following table. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC are the representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

**Principal Amount of**

**Initial Purchasers** **Notes**

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ..................................................................................................... $

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ....................................................................................................
BofA Securities, Inc. ...............................................................................................................
BNP Paribas Securities Corp. ..................................................................................................
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ...................................................................................................
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ....................................................................................................
TD Securities (USA) LLC .......................................................................................................
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. .................................................................................................

**Total ..................................................................................................................................** **$** **600,000,000**

The Initial Purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the notes being offered, if any are taken. The

initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the notes are released for
sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The offering of the notes by the
Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order
in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their respective affiliates.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has agreed

that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) in the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or (B) outside the United States to non-U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the
meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer,

sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’
distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date
the notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during
such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the

commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the
United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act.

The Issuer and the Note Guarantors have agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that

for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum, neither they, nor any of their subsidiaries or
other affiliates over which they exercise management or voting control, nor any person acting on their behalf will,
without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, offer, sell, contract
to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes.

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the notes on

any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market
after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will
develop and continue after this offering. We have been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers
intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time
without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading
market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected.

271


-----

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These

transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase
in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or
retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own

accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes
may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they
may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-thecounter market or otherwise. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to
the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes.

We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under

the Securities Act, or to contribute payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make because of any of
those liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various

activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and
non-financial activities and services. Specifically, affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates act as lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and may in the future provide, a variety of
these services to the Issuer and the Company and to persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer and the
Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In addition,
affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers are acting as lenders under our existing credit facilities and the Bilateral
Facility, and our existing revolving credit facility, and may receive certain of the proceeds used by the Company to
repay outstanding balances under our existing credit facilities and the Bilateral Facility. Affiliates of certain initial
purchasers are agents and lenders under the existing credit facilities and New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates,

officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their
own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or
relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the Issuer and the Company (directly, as collateral securing other
obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer and the Company. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market
color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or
instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions
in such assets, securities and instruments. Additionally, if the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending
relationship with us, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge and certain other of the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliate may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about        , 2024, which will be the

fifth business day following the date of this offering memorandum. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the second business day prior to
the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes will not initially settle in T+2,
to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.

public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document relating to
the notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Austria or used in
connection with any offer for subscription of notes to the public in Austria. Consequently, in Austria the notes will
only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any other offering material in relation to the notes is
directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Article 2 e) of the
EU Prospectus Regulation. The notes will not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
Austria. For the purpose of this clause, a "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of

in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for

rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a


-----

misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer
to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of
these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”), the Initial

Purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts
of interest in connection with this offering.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not being offered to the public in the European Economic Area (the "EEA) within the

meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the "EU Prospectus Regulation"), and includes any relevant
implementing measure in each member state of the EEA. In member states of the EEA, this offering
memorandum is directed only at persons who are “qualified investors” within the meaning of the EU
Prospectus Regulation. This offering memorandum must not be acted on or relied on in any member state of
the EEA by persons who are not qualified investors. Any investment or investment activity to which this
offering memorandum relates is available only to qualified investors in any member state of the EEA. Neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor will authorize, the making of any offer of notes other than to
qualified investors.

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be made

available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directiv e,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended) (the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”), for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in any member state

of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a
member state of the EEA of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this offering memorandum
may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer.
This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU Prospectus Regulation.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and January 1, 2021, and for each of

the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, have been included herein in reliance upon the report of
KPMG AB (“KPMG”), independent registered public accounting firm, appearing elsewhere herein.

The audit report covering the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and January

1, 2021, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, contains an explanatory
paragraph that states that as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2022, 2021, and 2020
consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct certain misstatements.

The registered business address of KPMG is Vasagatan 16, 111 20 Stockholm, Sweden.

In connection with the Amer Sports IPO, KPMG completed an independence assessment to evaluate its

independence under the SEC and the PCAOB independence rules. During KPMG’s independence evaluation
procedures, a service was identified between the KPMG member firm of the KPMG International Cooperative in
Bulgaria (“KPMG Bulgaria”) and a controlled subsidiary of the Company that was permissible under the
independence rules applicable at the time it was performed but impermissible under the SEC and PCAOB
independence rules applicable to audits in connection with this filing.

Late in 2022 and in early 2023, KPMG Bulgaria performed clerical assistance in the preparation and filing of a

registration in Bulgaria related to the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners of our subsidiary in Bulgaria. This
service was exited in April 2023. No fee has been or will be charged for the service rendered or the related costs
incurred.

KPMG provided the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to our board of directors and the audit

committee, including the entity involved, the nature of the service, the period over which the service existed, and the
potential fees and actual cost incurred by KPMG Bulgaria. Notwithstanding that the service is an impermissible
management function under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, the management of our subsidiary in Bulgaria retained all
decision making and ultimate responsibility for the service which was not complex or judgmental in nature.
Additionally, the service was not significant to KPMG and our subsidiary in Bulgaria, does not place KPMG in a
position of auditing its own work and does not place KPMG in a position of being an advocate for the Company.
The Bulgarian operation is not material and is not in scope for the group audit of the Company. Considering the
facts presented, our board of directors, the audit committee, and KPMG have concluded (1) that the service does not,
did not and will not impair KPMG’s application of objective and impartial judgment on any matter encompassed
within KPMG’s audits of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and for the
years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and (2) a reasonable investor would
reach the same conclusion.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

We are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we will be required to file

reports and other information with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K. The

## Annex A —
 Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
 Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests 

The following is an overview of certain insolvency considerations and limitations on the validity and

enforceability of the guarantees and the security interest certain jurisdictions outside of the United States in which a
material portion of the Collateral is located.

**Austria**

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Austrian insolvency law. The law relating to

insolvency is primarily regulated by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) (the “IO”). The IO regulates
on the one hand bankruptcy proceedings in which the debtor’s assets or company as a whole are sold and the
proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it also provides for recovery proceedings insolvency enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under
certain conditions. On top, in case of a likelihood of insolvency (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz), in particular if the
relevant company is imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig), restructuring proceedings under the Austrian
Restructuring Code may be opened. Creditors' rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization
Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency proceedings but regulates the
reorganization of companies in financial distress – see further below for details.

As to Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Austria (the “Austrian Guarantors”), a rebuttable

presumption exists that these entities also have their respective COMI in Austria.

Insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Austria in the event of an insolvency of a company having its COMI

in Austria, or if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of the Republic of Austria or, where the
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) does not apply, also if such company has assets in
Austria. Such proceedings will be governed by Austrian law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings
may also be opened in Austria in accordance with Austrian law with respect to the assets of companies that are not
organized under Austrian law.

Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) are opened by a court if the debtor is insolvent, provided that the

insolvency estate's value is sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings (or an advance
payment is made to cover such costs). In a nutshell, a debtor is insolvent in case of illiquidity within the meaning of
section 66 IO (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e., the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due) or, if the
debtor is a company, also over-indebtedness within the meaning of section 67 IO (Überschuldung) (i.e., the debtor’s
liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to
continue as a going concern (negative Fortbestehensprognose)). Under Austrian law, insolvency proceedings may
be initiated either by the debtor or a creditor by filing an application to that effect with a court of competent
jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a creditor’s request, such creditor will have to show that the
debtor is illiquid or over-indebted and the court as a general rule will hear the debtor. In the event that the debtor is
at imminent risk of becoming illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), only recovery proceedings may be initiated
and only upon the debtor's request.

The debtor is obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay upon insolvency. If

it is evident that an insolvency cannot be avoided, the debtor is obliged to file for insolvency immediately. If the
debtor undertakes ex ante promising and realistic measures to stabilize or reverse insolvency, the debtor has a
maximum period of 60 days to file. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IO has been amended to
allow the debtor 120 days to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor’s illiquidity is caused by a
natural disaster, which includes pandemics, epidemics, floods, avalanches, snow pressures, landslides, hurricanes,
earthquakes, or similar disasters of comparable magnitude.


-----

Depending on whether the debtor submits a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) together with the application for the

opening of insolvency proceedings, the initiated proceedings may be in the form of recovery proceedings
(Sanierungsverfahren), with or without self-administration (mit oder ohne Eigenverwaltung) or bankruptcy
proceedings (Konkursverfahren). If it is the debtor that has applied for the initiation of insolvency proceedings as
recovery proceedings and has submitted to the court a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) that offers a recovery rate of
at least 20% payable to the unsecured creditors within a maximum period of two years, the court initiates insolvency
proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings without self administration. If the conditions for recovery
proceedings are not met, the insolvency court initiates bankruptcy proceedings. There are additional legal provisions
regulating recovery proceedings not applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.

A debtor may also submit a recovery plan during bankruptcy proceedings that are already in progress. For the

debtor's recovery plan to be approved by the court it should meet certain criteria specified by sections 140 et seq. IO.

The purpose of a recovery plan is to enable a debtor to be released from a portion of its debts (not to exceed

80% of the aggregate amount thereof) and to continue its business operations. A recovery plan must be approved by
a “qualified majority” of the debtor's unsecured creditors for it to become effective. For the approval of the recovery
plan, two majorities must be reached: (i) more than half of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at
such hearing must approve the recovery plan and (ii) the creditors voting in favor of the recovery plan must
represent more than half of the aggregate amount of all claims of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote
at such creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung). Once the debtor has complied with the terms of a recovery plan
that was duly approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, it will be released from its remaining
outstanding unsecured debts. Unsecured creditors whose claims under the recovery plan have not been satisfied in
accordance with the plan's terms may enforce their individual claims against the debtor, moreover, the release from
debt is usually not fully applicable anymore to these creditors. In case the recovery plan is not approved by the
creditors, insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings.

If the recovery proceedings have been initiated, the debtor has submitted a recovery plan that offers a recovery

rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors over a maximum two-year period after the approval of such recovery
plan and some further prerequisites are met, the debtor qualifies for self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren mit
_Eigenverwaltung). It is possible that such proceedings are changed and continue in the form of recovery proceedings_
without self-administration and/or (subsequently) bankruptcy proceedings.

Other than under restructuring proceedings under the ReO (see below) recovery plans in recovery proceedings

do not contain creditor classes; there is, therefore, however, also no cross-class cram-down. Same as with the
proceedings under the ReO, the recovery plan cannot interfere with the legal and economic position of shareholders
against their will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders.
Creditors are not entitled to present their own (competing) recovery plan.

Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor is not allowed as of the date of the opening of the

insolvency proceedings to dispose of the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). The opening of
insolvency proceedings usually takes effect on the day following the publication of the court's order opening such
proceedings in the official online database of Austrian insolvencies (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the opening of
insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration), transactions of the debtor with
respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate have no effect against the creditors of the insolvency estate.
Certain of the administrator’s actions or transaction require the prior approval of the creditor’s committee (if
appointed) or the court.

With its decision to open the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator

(Insolvenzverwalter) and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor's business (either ex officio or upon
the request of the creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung)), appoint a creditors' committee (Gläubigerausschuss)
charged with monitoring and assisting the insolvency administrator in the discharge of its duties. After the opening
of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration) only the insolvency administrator
is entitled to act on behalf of the insolvency estate.

Under Austrian law, an insolvency administrator’s role is to continue the debtor’s business with a view to

enabling a potential reorganization of the debtor’s business either by implementing the debtor’s recovery plan or by
a (partial) sale of the debtor’s business. If neither a recovery plan nor a (partial) sale of the debtor’s business is
possible, the insolvency administrator will discontinue the debtor’s business operations (or parts of it). As a result of

A 2


-----

the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor's assets will be liquidated and the proceeds realized thereby will be
distributed to the debtor's creditors, with the debtor remaining liable for any portion of its debts not satisfied by such
proceeds.

If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will proceed with the appointment of a recovery

administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are
either subject to the recovery administrator’s approval or may be performed only by the recovery administrator.
Again, certain actions or transactions may also require the prior approval of the creditor’s committee (if appointed)
or the court.

Unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) wishing to assert their claims against the debtor need to participate in

the insolvency proceedings and must file their claim with the competent court within the period set out in the court
order opening the insolvency proceedings. At the respective hearing (examination hearing (Prüfungstagsatzung)),
the insolvency administrator must declare whether it acknowledges or contests each of the claims filed with the
court. If the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor’s claim, such creditor will be entitled to participate in
the insolvency proceedings and the pro rata distribution to unsecured creditors that will follow. If a creditor’s claim
is contested by the insolvency administrator, the creditor will have to seek enforcement of its claim in civil
proceedings and only then participate in the insolvency proceedings.

Claims of unsecured creditors which were created before the opening of the insolvency proceedings

(Insolvenzforderungen) rank pari passu among themselves. Certain claims which lawfully arose against the
insolvency estate after the opening of the insolvency proceedings (privileged claims (Masseforderungen)) enjoy
priority in insolvency proceedings. Claims which are secured by in rem security, such as pledge over shares
(preferential claims (Absonderungsrechte)), are entitled to preferential payment in the distribution of the proceeds
resulting from the realization of the charged asset. Creditors who have a right to preferential treatment may
participate in the pro rata distribution to the unsecured creditors to the extent that the proceeds from the realization
of the assets charged to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment.
Secured creditors do not have a voting right with respect to the approval of the recovery plan to the extent their
claim is covered by security. Claims relating to the payment of taxes, social security contributions and employee
compensation are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian law.

The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during such proceedings constitute

privileged claims (Masseforderungen) and rank prior to all other unsecured claims (Insolvenzforderungen). Claims
of creditors with a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte), such as creditors with a retention of
title or trustors (Treugeber), remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings. According to the IO, a
request for preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets of a debtor that are essential for the continuation
of the debtor’s business cannot be made within a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings,
unless, inter alia, the preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets is necessary to prevent the contractual
counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages.

Once insolvency proceedings have been opened it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with respect

to assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are subject to an automatic
stay (Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the last 60 days prior to the opening of insolvency
proceedings expire upon the opening of such insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exemptions), unless the
insolvency proceedings are terminated due to lack of funds to cover the cost of such proceedings. Execution liens
obtained within the last twelve months may be subject to voidance law.

According to the IO (and subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions), for a

period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractual counterparties of the debtor may
terminate contracts only for good cause. In this context, the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of
timely performance by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered a good cause
allowing a termination. This restriction only applies if a termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation
of the debtor's business. No restrictions apply if a termination of a contract is necessary to prevent the contractual
counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages. Furthermore, a contractual stipulation providing
for the right to withdraw from an agreement or for an automatic termination in the event of opening of insolvency
proceedings against the other party is not enforceable (again, subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other
financial transactions).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon

the opening of insolvency proceedings.

**_Reorganization Proceedings_**

The Austrian Business Reorganization Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) (the “URG”) governs

reorganizations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress to continue to do business
after having undergone a reorganization procedure. The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act is therefore not
designed to assist creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization of the debtor’s
enterprise. A reorganization procedure may be opened if there is no insolvency in place and a substantial and
sustainable deterioration of the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) may be certifiably anticipated. Only the
debtor may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is not insolvent at the
time of its application. Failure to timely apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings may result in personal
liability of the representatives of the relevant corporation. A presumption for the need of reorganization (Vermutung
_des Reorganisationsbedarfs) relevant for the opening of a business reorganization procedure is in place if the_
following criteria are met: a quota of own funds (Eigenmittel) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt
repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years, each as defined in, and determined in accordance
with, the URG. Pursuant to section 19 of the URG, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from
an agreement, for its automatic termination or the maturity of a disbursed loan facility in the event of the opening of
reorganization proceedings relating to the other party is (subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other
financial transactions) not enforceable.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

The Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung, “ReO”) is based on the Restructuring Directive

for the right of an entrepreneur (except for certain companies in the financial sector, such as credit institutions and
public bodies) to voluntarily file for the opening of restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) where
there is a likelihood of insolvency (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz), in particular where the relevant company is
imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). The likelihood of insolvency is presumed where the criteria for the
opening of a business reorganization procedure under the URG (see above) are met. Creditors cannot file for the
opening of restructuring proceedings.

The primary objective of the ReO is the approval of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) by the

majority of the creditors of the debtor in each class (see below). Such restructuring plan which shall ensure the
solvency of the debtor needs to be submitted by the debtor. Creditors are not entitled to present their own
(competing) plan. Under certain circumstances, the court may confirm the restructuring plan
(Restrukturierungsplan), even if the qualified majority is not reached in each class (cross-class cram-down). This
cram-down possibility is aimed at finally removing the disruptive potential of hold-out creditors outside of
insolvency proceedings.

Amongst others, the exercise of rights as well as their enforcement, may be limited under the ReO. For

example, and without limitation, (i) upon the acceptance and confirmation of a restructuring plan
(Restrukturierungsplan) claims may be restructured (for example by way of a payment deferral (Stundung) or a
reduction in the value of the relevant claims (Forderungskürzung)), subject to certain preconditions to be met, even
without the consent of or against the affected creditors, (ii) the ReO allows for a stay of individual enforcement
actions (Vollstreckungssperre) during restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) for a period of three
up to a maximum of six months and (iii) during restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) it is not
allowed, subject to certain prerequisites to be met and exemptions (e.g. for derivatives and other financial
transactions), to withhold performance or terminate, accelerate or, in any other way, modify essential contracts yet
to be performed (wesentliche noch zu erfüllende Verträge) to the detriment of the relevant debtor by virtue of a
contractual clause providing for such measures, solely by reason of, for instance, the opening of restructuring
proceedings or meeting the pre-requisites for the opening of restructuring proceedings.

The ReO provides for five different possible creditor classes in restructuring proceedings: (i) secured creditors,

(ii) unsecured creditors, (iii) bondholders, (iv) particularly vulnerable creditors (with claims below Euro 10,000) and
(v) subordinated creditors.

A 4


-----

Shareholders are subject to a general obligation not to unreasonably prevent restructuring measures. However,

shareholders cannot form a class in a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), with the consequence that there is
no possibility to outvote shareholders in a cross-class cram-down. Therefore, a restructuring plan
(Restrukturierungsplan) cannot interfere with their legal and economic position against their will and, for example, a
debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders.

New or interim financing as well as other transactions closely related to the restructuring (especially those

necessary for the continuation of the business) shall only be subject to limited avoidance actions in possible
subsequent insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, avoidance protection applies if the opposing
party did not know about the debtor's illiquidity.

The ReO also provides for a simplified fast-track restructuring procedure that can be used by the debtor if only

financial creditors will be subject to the proposed restructuring measures. In such simplified proceedings, the debtor
remains entirely in possession (no restructuring expert will be appointed). Further, creditors do not need to vote on a
restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) in a court hearing. Instead, the debtor submits to the court a restructuring
agreement that has already been signed by at least a 75% majority in value of each financial creditor class (no
majority based on headcount is required). Ultimately, such restructuring agreement can be sanctioned by the court
without the initiation of formal restructuring proceedings. Thus, it is also not possible to apply for an enforcement
stay in these fast-track proceedings. A cross-class cram-down will most likely not be possible in such proceedings.

Restructuring proceedings pursuant to the ReO, which do not qualify as European restructuring proceedings

(Europäisches _Restrukturierungsverfahren), are not published in publicly available registers or data bases._

**_Appointment of a Curator_**

Pursuant to the Act on Curators regarding Partial Debentures (Teilschuldverschreibungskuratorengesetz), a

curator may be appointed as representative for the holders of partial debentures (Teilschuldverschreibungen) by the
competent court under specific circumstances, in particular, if rights of holders of such partial debentures might be
endangered due to the lack of common representation. This might particularly be the case if insolvency proceedings
were opened against an issuer with its COMI in the Republic of Austria (see the explanation of COMI above).
Following this, in general and with regard to the scope of the representation by the curator, the respective holders of
such partial debentures may not exert their rights arising out of the partial debentures on their own, as such rights are
then exerted by the curator; however, they are in general entitled to accede the respective legal proceedings initiated
by the curator against the issuer as intervenor (Nebenintervenient).

The powers of the court-appointed trustee to exercise the collective rights of the noteholders would deprive the

noteholders and the trustee for the notes of their ability to exercise their rights under the transaction documents,
including their rights to enforce the Guarantees under the notes.

**_Equity Replacing Shareholder Loans_**

The Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) contains very detailed provisions

regarding equity replacing shareholder loans. It in particular stipulates that a loan (understood in a broad sense)
granted by a (direct or indirect) shareholder in a financial crisis (i.e., the subsidiary is (i) illiquid, (ii) over-indebted
(both in the meaning of the IO) or (iii) the quota of own funds (Eigenmittel) is less than 8% and a fictitious duration
of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) is more than 15 years, both as defined in, and determined in
accordance with, the URG) is deemed to be equity replacing. Equity replacing shareholder loans must not be repaid
as long as the crisis subsists and any security interest granted in connection with such loans must not be enforced.
This means, in particular, that in an insolvency of the subsidiary, the respective claims of the shareholder lender are
subordinated (i.e., there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) or a right for separate satisfaction
(Absonderungsrecht) for such claims). A shareholder is defined to be, inter alia, (i) a shareholder with controlling
participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person not holding a participation in
the borrower but having a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) regarding the borrower. Furthermore, a
person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as shareholder, inter alia, if (i) it holds a participation
or other rights in a person other than the borrowing company which allows a dominant influence (beherrschenden
_Einfluss) regarding the borrowing company (indirect controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a_
participation in the borrowing company of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation
in a company which holds a participation of at least 25% in the borrowing company.

A 5


-----

Also the granting of security can be subject to equity substitution, if a shareholder guarantees the repayment of

a third party’s loan, creates a pledge or provides comparable collateral at a time when the granting of a loan would
replace equity; in such case the third party may satisfy its claims from the collateral without having to take action
against the company first. As long as the crisis subsists the shareholder’s possibilities for recourse towards the
company are limited. Details are provided in sections 15, 16 of the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements.

Prior to the enactment of the Act on Equity Replacements, the Austrian Supreme Court had developed even

stricter rules on equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear whether, in addition to the
provisions of the Act on Equity Replacements, such rules (or certain of its rules) developed by the Austrian Supreme
Court are still applicable/relevant and would be applied by Austrian courts. In this context, it must also be noted that
it is uncertain whether the rules on equity substituting shareholder loans also apply to “a-typical pledgees”
(atypische Pfandgläubiger). The details are unclear and it is also unclear under what circumstances a secured lender
may qualify as a-typical pledgee.

**_Limitations on the Validity and the Enforcement of Guarantees by Austrian Guarantors_**

_Capital Maintenance Rules – General_

The provision and enforcement of upstream and cross stream guarantees or granting of collateral by the

Austrian Guarantors is subject to and may be limited by strict Austrian capital maintenance rules on the preservation
of corporate assets (Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian corporate law, in particular sections 82 et
seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (the
“Austrian GmbHG”) (or sections 52 and 65 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Joint Stock Companies (Aktiengesetz)
(the “Austrian AktG”) respectively). These rules protect the assets of the Austrian Guarantors for the benefit of
their respective creditors. The entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the registered share capital, is
protected by Austrian capital maintenance rules. Austrian capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited
partnerships of which the general partner/s is or are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders in
circumstances other than as a distribution of profits (if, to the extent and as long as available for distribution under
Austrian law), by a reduction of share capital or as liquidation surplus on liquidation of that corporations.
Guarantees or providing of collateral by an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited liability
partner of which is a corporation) in order to guarantee or otherwise secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
sister company are considered disbursements and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such
guarantees by the Austrian subsidiary were not for the Austrian subsidiary's corporate benefit (betrieblich
_gerechtfertigt). Austrian corporate law does not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit (betrieblich_
_gerechtfertigt) must be tested at the level of the individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit solely for the group (but not_
for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be sufficient. Any transaction that violate Austrian capital
maintenance rules are null and void. This nullity may also affect third parties (e.g., noteholders) if such third party
knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to
Austrian capital maintenance rules.

Therefore, in order to enable Austrian subsidiaries to provide a guarantee or any other form of collateral with

respect to liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company and in order to reduce the risk of violating
Austrian capital maintenance rules and the resultant invalidity and unenforceability, it is standard market practice for
indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries
incorporated or established in Austria (see Capital Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language). Pursuant to such
limitation language, the grant of collateral and the provision of upstream and sidestream guarantees of Austrian
subsidiaries are limited to the extent required to avoid a breach of the Austrian capital maintenance rules. However,
such limitation language is not capable of making guarantees or securing of liabilities permissible in general.

No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether the limitations set forth in the indenture

entered into by Austrian Guarantors, in particular regarding the limitation of the amount guaranteed to an amount
permitted under Austrian capital maintenance rules, would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law and achieve
the desired effect of legally preserving the Guarantees or any other form of collateral to the extent possible or
whether the Guarantees or any other form of collateral could be deemed void in their entirety. Moreover, Austrian
capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions, and it cannot be ruled out that future court rulings
may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of subsidiaries incorporated in Austria and
constituted in the form of a corporation or of a limited partnership the general partner or general partners of which is
or are corporations.

-----

_Capital Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language_

The limitation language for any Austrian Guarantor to be incorporated into in the indenture and / or guarantees,

will substantially be in the form as follows:

The obligations (Verpflichtungen) and liabilities (Haftungen) of a Guarantor incorporated in Austria (“Austrian

**Guarantor”) under or in connection with this Agreement, shall at all times be limited so that at no time the**
assumption of an obligation and/or liability under this Agreement would violate or contradict Austrian capital
maintenance rules (Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian company law, in particular, without
limitation, section 52 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Stock Corporations (Aktiengesetz – AktG) (and for the
avoidance of doubt including section 66a AktG), section 82 of the Austrian Act on Limited Liabilities Companies
(Gesetz über Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung – GmbHG) or any analogous application thereof (the “Austrian
**Capital Maintenance Rules”).**

If and to the extent the obligations (Verpflichtungen) and/or liabilities (Haftungen) of an Austrian Guarantor

under this Agreement would not be permitted under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, then such obligations
(Verpflichtungen) and/or liabilities (Haftungen) shall be limited in accordance with Austrian Capital Maintenance
Rules. To the extent any such obligation or liability of an Austrian Guarantor infringes or contradicts Austrian
Capital Maintenance Rules, such obligation or liability shall be deemed to be replaced by an obligation or liability of
a similar nature which is in compliance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and the payment obligations shall
be limited to the maximum amount permitted to be paid in accordance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and
provides the best possible security interest.

If and to the extent the assumption or enforcement of any (payment) obligation or liability by an Austrian

Guarantor under this Agreement could result in a risk to any officer of that Austrian Guarantor of civil liability or
criminal responsibility because of a violation of Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, the amount then payable in
respect of such obligation or liability shall be reduced to the maximum amount then permissible to be paid without
triggering such risk.

The Parties acknowledge that the limitations set out in this Agreement may have the effect of reducing any payment
permissible at a given time by an Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement to zero.

_Limitations on Enforcement – Regulatory Approvals_

Enforcement of the pledges over the Shares in the Austrian Guarantors or even the exercise of voting rights by

the Security Agent ahead of such enforcement may be conditional on certain approvals, including approvals under
applicable merger control laws and foreign direct investment laws.

_Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt_

Certain security interests such as pledges under Austrian law are accessory rights (akzessorisches Rechte) and

will therefore be subject to the same legal consequences as the secured obligations; if the secured obligations are
terminated or not valid, the same applies to the security interest. The security interest cannot be separated from the
secured obligations, which means that it can only be held and enforced by the creditor of such secured obligations.
Due to their accessory nature, pledges will cease by operation of Austrian law upon payment (or other discharge) of
the secured obligations.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent

for the purpose of the Security Agent being able to hold the Collateral. Pursuant to such parallel debt obligations, the
Security Agent is an independent and separate creditor, acting on behalf of itself and the secured parties, in respect
of each and every claim under the notes and the indenture. While parallel debt obligation are market standard and
believed to be recognized (if effective under their governing law), they are untested before the Austrian courts, and
no assurances can be given that parallel debt will be recognized in accordance with its terms by the Austrian courts.

_Hardening Periods and Clawback_

Under the voidance rules of the IO, an insolvency administrator may, by action of voidance or by defense of

voidance, under certain circumstances, challenge any transaction (which term for the purposes of this section
“Hardening periods and clawback” includes, without limitation, the granting of security and the guaranteeing,

assuming and/or paying of debt). In particular, the following transactions are voidable with respect to the debtor’s
creditors:

  - Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht), section 28 no 1 – 3
IO: All transactions (Rechtshandlungen) performed or entered into by the debtor within ten years prior to
the commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent known to the other party to discriminate
against its creditors as well as all transactions through which the debtor’s creditors are discriminated
against and which it performed or entered into during the last two years prior to commencement of
insolvency proceedings, provided that the beneficiary of the transaction should have been aware of such
intent. If the legal act was concluded with or for the benefit of certain connected persons (as defined by
law) the burden of proof regarding the knowledge of the intention to discriminate is shifted to that
connected person, i.e., the connected person must prove that they had no knowledge and was not negligent
in having no knowledge, respectively. Should the debtor be a legal entity capable of being a party in a
lawsuit, then members of the managing and supervisory bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's
shareholders with unlimited liability and the debtor's controlling shareholder or shareholders within the
definitions of the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) are deemed to be
connected.

  - Voidance due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung), section 28 no 4
IO: Delivery, purchase and barter transactions undertaken by the debtor in the last year prior to the
commencement of insolvency proceedings are voidable, if the other party perceived or should have
perceived the intent to discriminate against the debtor’s creditors through transactions below market value.

  - Voidance of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung unentgeltlicher
_oder ihnen gleichgestellter Verfügungen), section 29 IO: In particular, transactions of the debtor without_
consideration (except customary occasional gifts and transactions for a reasonable and proportionate
amount towards a charitable cause or for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, a moral duty or consideration
of decency) and acquisitions of property from the debtor by order of authority if paid out of the debtor’s
funds are voidable, if performed or entered into in the last two years prior to the commencement of
insolvency proceedings.

  - Voidance due to preferential treatment (Anfechtung wegen Begünstigung), section 30 IO: Security or
payment (Sicherstellung oder Befriedigung) given to a creditor after the occurrence of the debtor’s
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung), both within the meaning of the IO,
or after filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or in the last 60 days before such
filing/insolvency is voidable, if (i) the creditor obtained a security or payment it was not entitled to or not
entitled to in this particular manner or at that particular time, (ii) the security or payment was given to
persons who were aware or should have been aware of the intent of the debtor to treat them preferential
ahead of the debtor's other creditors, or (iii) the transaction was effected for the benefit of a connected
person, unless such connected person (as defined by law, see above) did not know and should not have
known about the debtor's intention to give preferential treatment. A grant of security or payment under such
circumstances is not voidable if the preferential treatment was given more than one year prior to the
commencement of insolvency proceedings.

  - Voidance due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), section 31 IO: Any transaction performed or entered into after the occurrence of the_
debtor's illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) both within the meaning
of the IO or after the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings may be challenged if:

    - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to a
connected person (as defined by law, see above), or any other transaction entered into by the debtor
with such connected person which is considered to be prejudicial to the debtor's creditors (nachteilige
_Rechtsgeschäfte), unless (i) with respect to such payment or granting of security, or to a transaction_
directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, such connected person did not have nor should have had
knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and (ii) with respect to a transaction indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's
creditors, the negative effect of such transaction on the insolvency estate was not objectively
foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction;

A 8


-----

    - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to a
creditor, or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with a third party which is directly
prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, provided that the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known
of the debtor's illiquidity, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings; and

    - entered into by the debtor with a third party which is indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors,
provided that (i) the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's illiquidity, overindebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) such
transaction's negative effect on the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable at the time of entering
into the transaction. Such transaction's negative effect is foreseeable, in particular, when a recovery
effort is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich untaugliches Sanierungskonzept).

A transaction is considered to be indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar nachteilig) if, even though it may be

objectively balanced, i.e., not directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, it nonetheless has a negative effect on the
recovery rate of unsecured creditors. Transactions carried out more than six months prior to the opening of
insolvency proceedings may not be voided due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis
_der Zahlungsunfähigkeit)._

The relevant hardening/suspect periods will commence upon the last act of the relevant transaction.

Furthermore, the relevant hardening/suspect periods will be extended by the term of a reorganization proceeding if
such reorganization proceeding terminates within the relevant hardening/suspect periods.

In addition to an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the IO, a creditor who has obtained

an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any transactions pursuant to the provisions of the
Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such
action vary to a certain extent from the rules described above, and the voidance periods commence from the date on
which such other creditor exercises its voidance rights in court.

The most relevant provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung) are: section 439 EO:

Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht) and voidance due to
squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung); section 440 EO: voidance of transactions
with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung unentgeltlicher oder ihnen gleichgestellter
_Verfügungen)._

**_Stamp Duty_**

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Gebührengesetz) (the “GebG”), ad valorem stamp duty is triggered upon

the creation of a document (Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the GebG) on
certain stampable transactions enumerated in the GebG. Stampable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements,
sureties, assignments, mortgages.

According to the GebG, stamp duty on, e.g.,

(a) sureties (Bürgschaften) as well as assumptions of liabilities as joint debtor (Schuldbeitritt) amounts to 1%

of the secured amount (depending on the wording of a guarantee, a guarantee may be treated as a surety or
as assumption of liabilities for stamp duty purposes); and

(b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in a case of an assignment for

security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the lower of either the secured amount or the value of the assigned
receivables.

Stampable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt from stamp

duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures the credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical
ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (section 20(5) of the
GebG).

As a general rule, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a stampable transaction is created in

Austria and such transaction is not exempt from stamp duty.

A 9


-----

Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a document on a stampable transaction outside of Austria may

trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may thus be triggered for a document created outside of Austria if (i) the parties to
the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat,
place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated
asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria (place of
performance within Austria).

If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be

triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into or sent to Austria and (i) the transaction
concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the
transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of
the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria.

Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a stampable transaction in a qualified

manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of
Finance, a confirming document is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be
derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties
and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both parties are obliged to
performance, a third party to furnish proof of the underlying transaction). Furthermore, stamp duty may be triggered
by a so-called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a
stampable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document on a (concluded) stampable
transaction.

If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the GebG generally the parties to the transaction are jointly and

severally liable for Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to
performance (e.g. a surety), the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g.,
the beneficiary of a surety) (section 28(1) of the GebG). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax
office is not duly notified of the stampable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification)
would be secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp
duty if triggered are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honoured by the tax authorities within their
discretion.

If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a stampable

transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to
100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was
made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the GebG have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.

_Enforcement of Judgments_

According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), foreign judgments are only enforceable if

reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by an ordinance
(Verordnung) of the Austrian government (in which ordinance the Austrian government confirms the reciprocity).
The Republic of Austria and the United States have not entered into a treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments rendered in either state's courts, other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial
matters. There is also no applicable ordinance of the Austrian government in place. As such, the courts of Austria
will not recognize and/or enforce a judgment obtained in the courts of the United States being a judgment rendered
by a United States federal or state court. Accordingly, the subject matter upon which a judgment has been obtained
in a United States federal or state court must be re-litigated before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable
Austrian civil procedure laws (Zivilprozessverfahren). Only after having obtained a final judgment before Austrian
courts can enforcement procedures be initiated under the Austrian Enforcement Act.

**Canada**

There is substantial doubt whether an action can be brought in Canada in the first instance on the basis of

liability predicated upon U.S. federal or state securities laws. A court of competent jurisdiction in any of the
provinces of Canada (a “Canadian Court”) would give a judgment based upon a final and conclusive in personam
judgment of any federal or state court located in the United States (a “U.S. Court”) for a sum certain, obtained
against a Canadian guarantor with respect to a claim arising out of its guarantee of the notes under the indenture (a

A 10


-----

“U.S. Judgment”), without reconsideration of the merits, if the U.S. Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction
over the Note Guarantor, as recognized by a Canadian Court (and submission in the indenture to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of a U.S. Court will be sufficient for that purpose), provided that (i) an action to enforce the U.S.
Judgment is commenced in the Canadian Court within any applicable limitation period, (ii) the Canadian Court has
discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the U.S. Judgment if the U.S. Judgment is under appeal or there is
another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating to the same cause of action as the U.S. Judgment, (iii) the
Canadian Court will render judgment only in Canadian dollars and (iv) an action in the Canadian Court on the U.S.
Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights
generally. The enforceability of a U.S. Judgment in a Canadian Court will be subject to the following defenses (A)
that the U.S. Judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of natural justice, (B) that the
U.S. Judgment is for a claim which under the laws of the province of Ontario would be characterized as based on a
foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal or other public law, (C) that the U.S. Judgment is contrary to public policy (as
the term is understood under the laws of the province of Ontario) or to an order made by the Attorney General of
Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition Tribunal under the
Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes or (D) that the U.S. Judgment
has been satisfied or is void under the applicable U.S. federal or state laws.

**_Insolvency_**

Certain guarantors are corporations formed under Canadian federal laws or the laws of various provinces of

Canada. In the event of insolvency of a Canadian guarantor, such guarantor may become subject to Canadian
bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization or similar proceedings and Canadian law would govern those
proceedings (“Canadian Insolvency Proceedings”).

During Canadian Insolvency Proceedings, creditors may be stayed from exercising their rights and remedies

against the debtor company, including in respect of any pre-filing obligations and any security, without prior
approval from the court-appointed officer and/or the court supervising the proceedings. Also, pursuant to such
proceedings, the debtor may prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise, reorganization or arrangement for
consideration by all or some of its creditors to be voted on by the class or classes of its creditors affected thereby.
Such a proposal or plan, as applicable, if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors and
if approved or sanctioned by the relevant court, would be binding on all creditors within any such class who may not
otherwise be willing to accept such plan or proposal. Moreover, subject to court oversight, in such proceedings the
debtor may be permitted to retain possession and administration of its property, including its cash collateral, even
though it may be in default under applicable debt instruments and security documents. Further, in such proceedings,
the court may, subject to certain conditions and on proper notice, create court-ordered charges on the assets of the
debtor to secure new financing, professional fees, post-filing amounts owing to critical suppliers, statutory director
liabilities or other amounts, in priority to the liens that secure the notes or the guarantees, as applicable.

The powers of the court in Canadian Insolvency Proceedings have been exercised broadly to protect a

restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether
payments under the notes or the related guarantees, as applicable, would be made following commencement of or
during such proceeding, whether or when the holders of the notes could exercise their rights in respect of the notes,
related guarantees or security, as applicable, whether and to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated
for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, or whether and to what extent claims under the
notes or the guarantees, as applicable, could be compromised. A court may also authorize the sale of assets of a
debtor company (without a creditor vote) free and clear of any security granted in the assets. Such security interest
would continue in respect of the proceeds of sale of the assets in the same priority it enjoyed immediately prior to
the court-approved sale. Court-approved sales by receivers are generally treated in the same manner.

The guarantees of a Canadian guarantor or security granted by it may be subject to review under applicable

Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and winding-up laws relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences,
transfers at undervalue or similar transactions and applicable provincial and territorial fraudulent conveyance and
preference laws and comparable provisions of other applicable laws if a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding or lawsuit
is commenced by or in respect of a Canadian guarantor.

Under applicable Canadian laws, on application by an interested party, a court could void a Canadian

guarantor’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or void the security granted by it, subordinate the guarantee to
such Canadian guarantor’s other debt or order another monetary or specific remedy if a Canadian court were to find

A 11


-----

that the incurrence of the guarantee or grant of security was a transfer at undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or
preference, or other form of impeachable transaction. For example, under Canadian federal bankruptcy and
insolvency legislation, a guarantee may be set aside or voided, or ordered that it is not effective as against a trustee
in bankruptcy and creditors, if it is established, in the case of a guarantee given to an arm’s length party, that the
Canadian guarantor:

  - became subject to the applicable Canadian Insolvency Proceedings within one year of issuing the guarantee
and, at the time it issued the guarantee, it received conspicuously less than fair market value for issuing the
guarantee (for example, based on the argument that the guarantee was incurred for the benefit of the Issuer
and only indirectly for the benefit of the relevant Canadian guarantor with the result that the obligations of
the relevant Canadian guarantor were incurred for undervalue), it was insolvent or rendered insolvent by
reason of issuing the guarantee, and it intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor;

  - became subject to the applicable Canadian Insolvency Proceedings within three months of issuing the
guarantee and, at the time it issued the guarantee, it was insolvent and it issued the guarantee to a creditor
with a view to giving the creditor a preference over another creditor (which is presumed if the effect was to
give the creditor a preference, absent evidence to the contrary).

Under such legislation, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

  - it is unable to meet its obligations as they generally become due;

  - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due;

  - the aggregate of its assets is not, at fair valuation, sufficient, or if disposed at a fairly conducted sale under
legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing due; or

  - it is reasonably expected to run out of liquidity within a reasonable proximity of time as compared with the
time reasonably required to implement a restructuring.

Because fraudulent conveyances and other forms of impeachable transactions in the context of insolvency are

also subject to provincial laws, other tests may apply and the extent of review and available remedies will vary
depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether an impeachable transaction has occurred.

We cannot be sure, depending on the circumstances, that a guarantee or security would not be voided or the

guarantee would not be subordinated to the Canadian guarantor’s other debt. In the event of a finding that a
fraudulent conveyance or other form of impeachable transaction has occurred in respect of the guarantee or security,
holders of the notes would cease to have any direct claim against the guarantor that delivered that guarantee or the
collateral subject to the security, as the case may be, and may not receive repayment on the notes.

**Cayman Islands**

The Cayman Islands is a British Overseas Territory. The Cayman Islands makes its own laws and has

independent legal and judicial systems. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial
precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding,
authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The Companies Act (As Revised) (the “Cayman Companies Act”) is
derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent English statutory
enactments and accordingly there are significant differences between the Cayman Companies Act and the current
Companies Act of England.

Although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state

courts of the United States (and the Cayman Islands are not a party to any treaties for the reciprocal enforcement or
recognition of such judgments with the United States), the courts of the Cayman Islands would recognize as a valid
judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States
against the Company under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of
multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) or, in certain
circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief, and would give a judgment based thereon
provided that (a) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment; (b) such courts did

A 12


-----

not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman Islands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d)
the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new
admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the
Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.
A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

Under the Cayman Companies Act, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Grand Court”) may wind up a

company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands in certain circumstances as set out in section 92 of the
Cayman Companies Act, and may accept and hear petitions for the winding up of such company from a creditor or
contributory of such company in accordance with the Cayman Companies Act.

Where a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands is wound up by way of voluntary

liquidation commenced in the circumstances set out in section 116 of the Cayman Companies Act or is subject to a
winding up order by the Grand Court, then the provisions of the Cayman Companies Act and the Cayman Islands
insolvency law, including the Companies Winding up Rules (As Revised), would apply.

The Cayman Companies Act contains statutory provisions which provide that a company may present a petition

to the Grand Court for the appointment of a restructuring officer on the grounds that the company (a) is or is likely
to become unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 93 of the Cayman Companies Act; and (b) intends
to present a compromise or arrangement to its creditors (or classes thereof) either, pursuant to the Cayman
Companies Act, the law of a foreign country or by way of a consensual restructuring. The petition may be presented
by a company acting by its directors, without a resolution of its members or an express power in its articles of
association. On hearing such a petition, the Grand Court may, among other things, make an order appointing a
restructuring officer or make any other order as the Grand Court thinks fit.

Notwithstanding that a liquidator, a restructuring officer and the Grand Court would apply Cayman Islands

insolvency law to a winding up or restructuring under the Cayman Companies Act, foreign laws, including foreign
insolvency laws, may nevertheless be relevant in any proceedings in the Cayman Islands. For example, foreign law
may be relevant in a Cayman Islands liquidation where it is the proper law of a creditor’s claim. If under foreign law
the creditor’s claim has been compromised (for example, in a foreign scheme of arrangement) then the Cayman
Islands liquidator is likely to be bound by that compromise. Furthermore, where a company incorporated under the
laws of the Cayman Islands is also being wound up in a foreign jurisdiction, the insolvency laws of that foreign
jurisdiction are likely to apply to the treatment of any of the company’s assets which are under the jurisdiction of the
foreign court. The rules applicable in such a foreign (ancillary) winding up may be different to the rules applicable
to the winding up in the Cayman Islands.

The rights of the secured creditors to enforce their rights under the guarantees may be limited by section 86 or

section 91I of the Cayman Companies Act which provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company
and its creditors or any class of them shall be binding on all the creditors or a class of creditors, as the case may be,
provided that the compromise or arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of creditors with
whom the compromise or arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent seventy-five per cent in
value of each such class of creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a
meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the compromise
or arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court. Cayman Islands authority provides that a class is constituted
by those creditors whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a
view to their common interest.

**European Union**

Certain of the Note Guarantors are organized under the laws of an EU Member State (the “EU Guarantors”).

Pursuant to the recast Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies to public collective
insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in Annex A opened after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain
exceptions) within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the EU Member State in which a
company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is
situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings relating to such company. The determination of
where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial

A 13


-----

difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is

required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be
challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a presumption that in the absence of proof to

the contrary a company has its “centre of main interests” in the EU Member State in which it has its registered
office. However, such assumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another EU Member
State within the three month period prior to the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30)
provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a
Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and
supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Article 3(1) also states that the
“centre of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration
a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company, including in particular where board
meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and
the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests”
may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent
jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its

registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other
EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member
State.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings

as well as to restructuring proceedings, in each case of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark) under

Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an
“establishment” in the territory of such other EU Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in
the 3 month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings, with “establishment”
being defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior
to the petition to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and
assets. If the Issuer and the EU Guarantors do not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of
any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU Member State are
restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other EU Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the EU Member State in which the company has its “centre of

main interests,” any proceedings opened subsequently in another EU Member State in which the company has an
establishment will be secondary proceedings whose effects are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the
territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the company has
its “centre of main interests” have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in
another EU Member State where the company has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be opened in the EU Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that EU
Member State’s law or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose
claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment in the other EU Member State, or (ii) a
public authority of the other EU Member State has the right to request the opening of the proceedings. Irrespective
of whether the insolvency proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings

A 14


-----

will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court
that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of
the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings
have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the
insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation

shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or
immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time,
belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of
proceedings. Rights in rem include:

(i) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or
income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

(ii) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or

by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

(iii) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them

contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

(iv) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening

main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other EU Member States so long as no territorial
proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in an EU Member State
which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may
exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such as to
remove assets of the company from that other EU Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no other
insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU Member State or any preservation measure has been
taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the
company has assets.

However, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of

secondary insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the
assets located in the EU Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the
distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization will comply with the
distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings
were opened in such other EU Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval
by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other EU
Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open
secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general
interests of local creditors.

Additionally, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow

for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a
period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local
creditors.

Furthermore, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of

realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the
creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the
court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that

insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency
practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency
practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is
appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before
which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation
is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules
applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate,
appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**Finland**

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

Amer Sports Corporation (Fi: Amer Sports Oy) and certain of its subsidiaries are incorporated and have their

centre of main interests in Finland. In the event of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may
be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings would be governed by Finnish law. In case of insolvency proceedings
connected to another EU member state within the meaning of regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU
member state, the regulation shall apply.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Finnish insolvency law.

The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended), the Finnish

Restructuring of Enterprises Act (Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended, the “Finnish
**Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (the “Recovery**
**Act”) (Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään, 758/1991, as amended) are particularly relevant to this**
discussion.

Under Finnish law, if a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, the company may be the

subject of two alternative types of proceedings: company restructuring (yrityssaneeraus) and bankruptcy
(konkurssi). Further, the company restructuring proceedings may be divided into a standard company
restructuring proceedings (perusmuotoinen yrityssaneeraus) described below more in detail and early
restructuring proceeding (varhainen saneerausmenettely). Liquidation proceedings (selvitystila) under the Finnish
Companies Act (the “Finnish Companies Act”) (Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended) generally concern only
solvent companies as there is an obligation to conclude liquidation proceedings and file for bankruptcy if the full
settlement of all of the company’s debts is not possible in liquidation.

**_Company Restructuring_**

If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that company restructuring

proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily, an application for
company restructuring can be submitted to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with
the Finnish Restructuring Act. Further, the initiation of company restructuring proceedings is possible—in theory,
irrespective of the company’s solvency situation—when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at
least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the
debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company restructuring.

If no statutory barriers to restructuring under the Finnish Restructuring Act are established and, consequently,

the court approves the application and opens restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a
restructuring administrator (selvittäjä). The purpose of a company restructuring is to investigate whether the
business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its
continued viability and make debt arrangements with creditors and execute other measures. The Board of
Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during the restructuring
proceedings. The restructuring administrator is entitled to review the company’s books and business documents
and obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate in meetings of the
debtor’s corporate bodies. The restructuring administrator’s consent is required to certain legal acts of a
significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Restructuring Act.

A 16


-----

The commencement of restructuring proceedings, as a general rule, has no effect on the debtor’s existing

contracts (though reorganizing debts deriving from such contracts may obviously be reorganized). However, there
are some exceptions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act regarding premature termination of certain
contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the
debtor, long-term contracts whereunder the debtor has committed to regularly perform certain obligations (other
than the payment of cash) and employment relationships.

_Moratorium_

Subject to certain exceptions, all existing claims against the company that have arisen before the filing of the

restructuring application are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension
prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts
(although debts arising after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and can be enforced), and the
seizure of assets. The court may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such prohibitions are in
effect on an interim basis as of a date even prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (i.e., shortly
after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings). The suspensions are in force until the
restructuring program has been verified by the district court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified in
the Finnish Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted.

Debts arising after the filing of the application must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to fees,

charges and other running expenses (e.g., lease payments) based on a continuous contractual relationship or on a
continuous contract on use or possession, to the extent as these relate to the period subsequent to the filing of the
application.

_Debt Arrangements_

Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts (i.e., debts that

have arisen before the filing of the application) within the restructuring program.

Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken

with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that
debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs
only second; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of
a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also
include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by the issuance of new debt or with
payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard to the creditor’s position and field of
business.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security

interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the
deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. The part of the claim that is not covered by the
value of the security is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings. Regarding
business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value
of the property will be determined by the restructuring program.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule;

(ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other
credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining
term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured debt as a lump
sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt.

Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security right, the security

arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security.

Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid

within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the
creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for
reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into consideration

A 17


-----

in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and
credit costs.

_Approval of the Restructuring Program_

The draft of the restructuring program will be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court will

ratify it subject to the approval of all the creditors or with the acceptance of the majority in the groups of creditors.
However, there are some specific limitations under the Finnish Restructuring Act which apply even if the
restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors. Furthermore, even if the
majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program may nonetheless be approved
at the request of the person who has prepared the draft, the administrator or the debtor, subject to the terms specified
in the Finnish Restructuring Act. In such a case the restructuring claims of the creditors in favor of the program must
represent at minimum one-fifth of all restructuring claims of the debtor company taken into consideration in the
voting procedure in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring Act and at least one group of creditors must have
voted for approval of the program by majority. The debtor may also submit a proposal to the court with respect to
the restructuring program, which the court may consider in its discretion.

_Early Restructuring Proceeding_

In addition to what has been described above in respect of standard restructuring proceedings, debtors facing

impending insolvency also have an option under the Finnish Restructuring Act to apply for the commencement of
early restructuring proceedings. Early restructuring proceedings are more easily accessible to debtors, as the
commencement of such proceedings does not require that the relevant debtor would already be insolvent, and
creditors have more restricted rights to object to the commencement of such proceedings. The initiation of early
insolvency proceedings by the creditors is not possible.

The court deciding on the commencement of early insolvency proceedings may prohibit the placing of any

security and payment of any existing debt as described under “Moratorium” above. However, in early restructuring
proceedings, such restrictions have to be ordered by the court deciding on the restructuring application and such
moratorium may remain in force for up three months which period may be extended by the court to up to 12 months
based on an application from either the debtor, the administrator or a creditor. In case the debtor is later found
insolvent, the administrator (if appointed) may with the consensus of the debtor and creditors representing 20% of
restructuring debt apply for a transfer to standard restructuring proceedings.

In general, the content and process of the early restructuring proceedings is by large similar to standard

restructuring proceedings.

**_Bankruptcy_**

A debtor or a qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent jurisdiction when the

debtor is unable to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary, i.e. considered to be insolvent. If the
application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) (pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by
the court.

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and

use the proceeds received in payment of the creditors’ claims. The bankruptcy estate may (in exceptional situations)
continue the company’s business operations and the disposal of property should be realized as soon as it is
reasonably possible. The debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the
estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must
act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in
matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors.

_Notices to the Bankruptcy Estate with regard to Claims_

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a

“lodgment of claim”) with the estate administrator, by a deadline set by the estate administrator. Information
concerning the deadline is sent to all known creditors and published in local newspaper as well as in the official
gazette of Finland (Virallinen lehti). The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a
creditor with a secured claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third

A 18


-----

party must, at the request of, and within a time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information on
the receivables and collateral as should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over
the assets of the debtor, as referred to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (Yrityskiinnityslaki 634/1984, as
amended), as security for a claim shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is
denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is
determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving

notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim
letter.

_Disbursements_

The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors

(“draft disbursement list”). The court verifies that the estate administrator’s disbursement list meets the statutory
requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft disbursement list have been observed.

The entitlement of creditors to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate is proportionate to the

amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to the Finnish Act on Order of
Payment of the Creditors (Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä, 1578/1992, as amended), the following
creditors have priority over unsecured creditors in the following order: (i) creditors of secured claims (excluding
claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights, with priority over the proceeds from the
respective security asset; (ii) the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts
that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is
responsible by operation of law and a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of
restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy,
(A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with penal interest incurred until the time of payment of the
fees and expenses and after satisfaction of said payment and (B) creditors of a debt that has arisen between the
commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings and (iv) claims that are secured by a business
mortgage will receive prior to other unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets.

Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such

claims are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy
and a loan or a bond which pursuant to its terms is subordinated to ordinary debt. The Finnish state has no
preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges.

The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize

the aggregate net proceeds, including by way of auctions, through advertising and direct solicitation of potential
buyers. However, creditors that have an interest in collateral may exercise their right of liquidation of collateral
regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale of
pledged property for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate
only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission. At the
request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in accordance with the provisions
of the Finnish Enforcement Code (the “Finnish Enforcement Code”) (Ulosottokaari, 705/2007, as amended) if the
bailiff consents to the same.

**_Recovery of Assets_**

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked if the rights of creditors have

been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code, the
grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and
enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company restructuring and certain creditors may

seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement
proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery
against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this period to file
an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that

A 19


-----

the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of a company
restructuring program, the administrator must file an action within six months from the commencement of the
restructuring proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator has discovered or should
have discovered grounds for recovery.

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who

becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded
within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed
with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the
transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of
other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the
creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in
case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the
counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction
to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above
in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5
of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus
applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described
above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s
sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction.

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the

good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and
(iii) the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for
bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that
the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual
means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable
in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are
taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the
petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in
the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered
if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession
of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without
unjustified delay after the granting of the credit.

When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the debtor

bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation
that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the
party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no
obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable,
compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause
inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the
value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate
for any decrease in value of the returnable property.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees_**

The Guarantee granted by Amer Sports Corporation and other Notes Guarantors incorporated in Finland (the

“Finnish Guarantors”) will be limited by a general limitation that limits the scope of the guarantee to the extent the
grant of such guarantee would be contrary to certain mandatory provisions of the Finnish Companies Act
(Osakeyhtiölaki, 624/2006, as amended). Pursuant to such limitation, the beneficiaries of the guarantee agree to
enforce the guarantee against the Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a
breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by the Finnish Guarantor. Certain significant
limitations to a company’s ability to grant guarantees are included in sections 1 and 10 of chapter 13 of the Finnish
Companies Act regulating the unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the
Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or
security for the purpose of a third-party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. While the matter

A 20


-----

is not entirely clear under Finnish law, the prevailing view among Finnish scholars seems to be that the financing of
an acquisition of shares in a foreign direct or indirect holding company would fall outside the scope of the before
mentioned prohibition provided that such foreign parent company is not a member of a group of companies
controlled by a qualifying Finnish legal entity but the prohibition of financial assistance may well apply fully to all
direct and indirect parent companies of the Finnish Guarantor, including foreign companies. Further, under Finnish
law if a company undertakes a transaction with or for the benefit of a direct or indirect parent company or another
related party on terms that deviate to the detriment of the company from arms’ length terms, then this may be
construed as unlawful profit distribution. The Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be
granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds,
i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate
benefit to the company, all relevant circumstances, benefits and risks to the company (on a standalone basis, and any
group benefit being taken into account only if and to the extent it directly or indirectly benefits the company itself)
are to be taken into account. In the context of the guarantee, among other things, other guarantees and security
granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the group companies in
connection with the issue of the notes are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the guarantee granted
by the Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be
guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful
profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be
effectively guaranteed.

For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees

to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with
the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Guarantees granted by the Finnish Guarantors will
contain such limitation language and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of the
guarantee agree to enforce the guarantees against the Finnish Guarantors only to the extent that such enforcement
does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by the Finnish Guarantors.

The limitations referred to above also apply to security granted by the Finnish Guarantors and the scope of such

security would be similarly limited.

**_Creation of a Valid Security Interest_**

Other than in respect of the creation of registered mortgages over assets belonging to certain specific asset

classes (such as real estate, qualifying vehicles and intellectual property rights) capable of being the subject of
registered security, the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by
pledging the security assets and perfecting such pledge, typically, in respect of movable assets (including shares, in
case share certificates evidencing such shares have been issued), by transferring such security assets into the
exclusive physical possession of the pledgee or, in respect of receivables (and shares, in case share certificates have
not been issued in respect of such shares), by notifying the person from whom the receivable is owed, or the
company whose shares have been pledged, of the creation of the pledge over the relevant receivables or shares or, in
the case of shares in certain types of property companies that have been registered in Finnish Register of Housing
Company Shares, by the registration of such security interest in said register. In order for the perfection to be
effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets.
If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or
collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have
been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event.
Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible
and be set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time period before the
commencement of insolvency proceedings.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

Enforcement can take place either outside of bankruptcy proceedings or during bankruptcy proceedings under

certain criteria. Instead, in company restructuring proceedings, a moratorium applies, and enforcement is generally
not possible. The terms of the relevant security agreement regulate the enforcement, however, subject to constraints
set by mandatory Finnish law.

A 21


-----

The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the

involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement. A
pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale. The enforcement of an enterprise mortgage or real estate
mortgage requires an enforceable title for execution and such enforcement can be effected only in accordance with
mandatory provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code.

The Finnish Commercial Code (Kauppakaari, 3/1734, as amended) stipulates a default process in respect of an

enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default process.
The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory invalidity of
a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically transfer to the
pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce the security,
effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership of the pledged
asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor and other creditors of
the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.

**_Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_**

It is generally possible under Finnish law to grant guarantees and security interests in favor of the secured

parties represented by an agent acting on behalf of the secured parties and the Finnish Act on Bondholder
Representatives (Laki joukkolainanhaltijoiden edustajasta, 574/2017, as amended) recognizes the concept of
security/collateral agency as part of Finnish law. The concept of trust does not exist under Finnish law and unless
the trustee is treated as the agent of the secured parties, the security will be invalid should Finnish law be deemed
applicable.

**_Enforcement of Judgments_**

As there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards)

in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland, courts in Finland will not automatically
recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution
(i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court
judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions
of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application
by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to
such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered
applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an
outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a

Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as
proven by the claimant. Contractual penalties (regardless of proof of actual damage) are, however, as a general rule
enforceable. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented
lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily
on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly
defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use
as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of
counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish
law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial)
after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or

moratorium as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.

**_Taxation_**

The following includes only a general summary applicable to Finnish tax resident individuals (i.e. generally

liable to tax in Finland), who are taxed in accordance with the Finnish Income Tax Act (1535/1992, as amended, Fi:
Tuloverolaki,) and to Finnish limited liability companies that are taxed in accordance with the Finnish Business
Income Tax Act (360/1968, as amended, Fi: Laki elinkeinotulon verottamisesta) relating to potential income and

A 22


-----

capital gains arising from the notes as well as the withholding tax consequences of the notes. The overview also
covers a general discussion in light of the Finnish Transfer Tax Act (29.11.1996/931, as amended, Fi:
Varainsiirtoverolaki).

The following does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Finnish tax considerations that may be

relevant to a decision to purchase the notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances
that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Finland currently in force and as
applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Prospective purchasers of the notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences
(including tax reporting obligations) of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the notes under the tax laws of
Finland and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

_Withholding Tax_

On the basis that the Issuers are not resident in Finland for tax purposes and have no presence or permanent

establishment in Finland, there is no Finnish withholding tax (Fi: Lähdevero) applicable to payments made by the
Issuers in respect of the notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Finland operates a system of preliminary taxation to secure payment of taxes in

certain circumstances. In the context of the notes, a preliminary tax (Fi: Ennakonpidätys) of 30 per cent will
generally be deducted and withheld from all payments that are treated as interest or as compensation comparable to
interest (such as secondary market compensation), if and to the extent such payments are made by a paying agent or
intermediary established in Finland (as defined and within the meaning of Finnish law) to Finnish tax resident
individuals. Such preliminary tax will be used for the payment of the individual’s final taxes (which means that they
are credited against the individual’s final tax liability). Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to limited
liability companies resident in Finland for Finnish income tax purposes may be made without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Finnish tax.

_Taxation of Finnish Resident Limited Liability Companies_

Interest and any similar payments made to limited liability companies residing in Finland as well as any capital

gain received by such companies from disposal of the notes are taxable income. Current applicable corporate income
tax rate is 20%. Correspondingly, any loss resulting from the disposal or redemption of the notes is deductible from
the taxable business income.

_Taxation of Finnish Resident Individuals_

Interest and any similar payments (e.g., interest compensation or jälkimarkkinahyvitys and index compensation

or indeksihyvitys) made to Finnish resident individuals as well as any capital gain received from disposal of the
notes by Finnish resident individuals are taxable capital income of the receiver. Capital income is taxable at the rate
of 30% and at the rate of 34% for the amount of capital income exceeding €30,000 in the tax year in question.
Capital loss is primarily deductible from the resident individual’s capital gains and secondarily from other capital
income arising in the same year and during the following five calendar years.

_Transfer Taxation_

There is no Finnish transfer tax payable on the acquisition, disposal or redemption of the notes.

**France**

Amer Sports Holding S.A.S., and Salomon S.A.S., guarantors of the notes (the “French Guarantors”), are

incorporated under the laws of France and, as such, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings (i.e.,
_mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings), which do not fall within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation, see_
“—European Union”. The mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are confidential proceedings (save for, with
respect to the mandat ad hoc proceedings, the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to
the statutory auditors, if any, and, with respect to the conciliation proceedings, the disclosure of the court decision
commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any, and, if applicable, the homologation of the conciliation
agreement). In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France, or, (ii) in cases where the EU

A 23


-----

Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office is in France, it could also be subject to French courtadministered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings or accelerated safeguard proceedings
(sauvegarde or sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial
liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial

safeguard (which does no longer exist and was replaced by one single proceeding namely accelerated safeguard
proceedings by Ordinance No. 2021-1193 dated September 15, 2021), judicial reorganization and judicial
liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any
company having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of
the EU Insolvency Regulation and any company having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU
Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation (it being specified that in this case, the effects of those proceedings shall
be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in France, Article 3, 2°).

Pursuant to Article L. 721-8 of the French Commercial Code, specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or

court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with
the companies under their control) (y) at least €20 million in annual net turnover and 250 employees or (z) at least
€40 million in annual net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international
jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency
Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such
specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the member

of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having
international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above, and to specific
control thresholds), accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for
this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of a group._

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive

restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of
procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132
(Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU **Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.**

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that

are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to
continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full
discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the
effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular
with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,

insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive
restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to
promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage,
when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most
notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement
actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims
shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors
of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a
restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class
and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class
cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting
creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required
majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will
in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing
the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect

A 24


-----

new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in
the context of a restructuring.

In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government issued:

(i) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from October 1[st],
2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such
date; and

(ii) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the 2021

Ordinance.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment

over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and corresponding
security interests in the Collateral.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law, as

amended by the 2021 Ordinance and the 2021 Decree for informational purposes only and does not address all the
French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the notes.

**_Grace Periods_**

Pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil proceeding involving the

debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the
creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates or payment obligations that are due over
a maximum period of two years. In addition, pursuant to Article 1343-5, if a debtor specifically initiates proceedings
thereunder, French courts may decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled,
will bear interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published
semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the
principal. If a court order under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the
period ordered by the court.

When the debtor is subject to conciliation proceeding, these provisions shall be read in combination with Article

L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, see “—Conciliation Proceedings (Procédure de Conciliation).”

**_Insolvency (Cessation des Paiements)_**

Under French law, a company is deemed insolvent (in cessation des paiements) when it is not able to pay its

debts as they fall due out of its immediately available and liquid assets, taking into account any existing
rescheduling agreement and moratorium which its creditors may have granted as well as any available liquidity
reserves.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings (either judicial reorganization or judicial

liquidation) within 45 days of becoming insolvent unless it has initiated conciliation proceedings within the same
period. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers, may be subject to civil liability.
Insolvency proceedings may also be initiated upon the initiative of a creditor or of the State prosecutor, provided
that the debtor is insolvent.

The date of insolvency (date d’état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court

ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier
date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the
hardening period (période suspecte).

A 25

**_Warning Procedure (Procédure d'alerte)_**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for warning procedures.

Indeed, if a company is incorporated as a société anonyme, when there are elements which they believe are likely to
jeopardize the continuity of the company’s existence as a going concern (des faits de nature à compromettre la
_continuité de l’exploitation), the statutory auditors of a company must inform the chairman of the board of directors_
(conseil d’administration) or the chairman of the management board (directoire) to provide an explanation. Failing
satisfactory explanations or appropriate corrective measures within 15 calendar days, the auditors must request that a
meeting of the board of directors (or a meeting of the equivalent body) be convened and may request to be heard by
the President of the relevant commercial court (tribunal de commerce). The minutes of the meeting of the board of
directors or of the supervisory board are sent to the President of the relevant commercial court and to the social and
economic committee (comité économique et social).

If despite of the auditors’ request, the meeting of the board of directors (or of the equivalent body) has not been

convened, or if the auditors have not convened to such meeting, or failing satisfactory explanations or appropriate
corrective measures, a shareholders’ meeting shall be convened by the management and the auditors present a
special report on this occasion (which is also addressed to the social and economic committee). If management fails
to act, then the statutory auditors convenes the shareholders’ meeting themselves and sets the agenda.

Further to the shareholders’ meeting, if the auditors consider that the decisions taken do not enable the

continuity of the company’s operations, auditors must inform the President of the relevant commercial court of the
warning procedure and may request to be heard by the President of the relevant commercial court. As regards
companies not incorporated as société anonyme, similar warning procedures exist even if the practical details
slightly differ.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their absence, the

employees’ representatives have similar rights.

In addition, pursuant to article L. 611-2 of the French Commercial Code, where it results from any document or

procedure that the continuity of the company’s operations is likely to be jeopardized (des faits de nature à
_compromettre la continuité de l’exploitation), the management of the company may be summoned by the president_
of the relevant commercial court in order to consider the appropriate measures to improve the situation. As soon as
such notice is sent, the President of the relevant commercial court may obtain from the auditors, the social and
economic committee and public administrations, among others, information likely to provide an accurate update of
the economic and financial situation of the company. When the annual financial statements of the company are not
filed within the time limits provided by law, the president of the relevant commercial court may order the
management to do so as soon as possible, subject to a fine.

Pursuant to the provisions of article L. 611-2-1 of the French Commercial Code, the competent civil court

(tribunal judiciaire) will also be able to exercise the emergency procedure for debtors subject to its jurisdiction.

In addition, where a warning procedure is initiated in accordance with articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2, L. 251-15 and

L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code, if the statutory auditors consider that the situation of the relevant
company requires immediate actions, and has determined that the management is refusing to take such actions or is
taking insufficient measures, the statutory auditors may inform the President of the relevant commercial court
concurrently with his or her initial report made to the management, to the chairman of the board of directors (conseil
_d’administration) or to the chairman of the supervisory board (conseil de surveillance), as the case may be. In such_
case, the statutory auditor may communicate by any means and without delay to the president of the relevant
commercial court his or her findings and proceedings, and may produce copies of any relevant documents.

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted

proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

A 26


-----

**_Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings (Mandat Ad Hoc)_**

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings are optional and may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion,_

provided that the debtor is not insolvent, see “—Insolvency test” above. The proceedings consist of informal
negotiations between a company and its major creditors and are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the
court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time but the process usually lasts from
one month to one year. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the president of the court (usually the
commercial court) who appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between
the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those dissenting creditors
not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it (no cram-downs can be imposed
unless an accelerated safeguard proceeding (sauvegarde accélérée) is opened). Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not
automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor
to recover their claims but those who have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for
their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article
1343-5 of the French Civil Code, see “—Grace periods.” The agreement reached is reported to the president of the
court but is not formally approved by it. The debtor is not required to inform the social and economic committee of
the appointment of the court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc).

**_Conciliation Proceedings (Procédure de Conciliation)_**

_Conciliation proceedings are optional and may only be initiated by a debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_

difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature but (at the time the conciliation proceedings are commenced) is
not insolvent (“Insolvency test”) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. Conciliation proceedings
are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory
auditors, if any, and, if applicable, the homologation of the conciliation agreement). They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court. The debtor is not required to inform the social and economic committee of
the opening of the conciliation proceedings but will need to do so if the conciliation agreement is ultimately
approved.

The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request

of the conciliateur, the president of the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five
months). If the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged
(constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place
afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or
the court itself.

The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors

and/or trade partners and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring
of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: (i) those dissenting creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
agreement nor forced to accept it (no cram-downs can be imposed). Conciliation proceedings do not automatically
stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their
claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration and
(ii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation
_judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings._

Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the

right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period (debt rescheduling for a maximum of two years)
in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, see “—Grace periods,” provided that (i) a creditor has
formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment, or if the debtor faces enforcement measures from a
creditor, or (ii) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliateur, a request made by the
_conciliateur to defer payment of his claim._

A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with

respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge.

A 27


-----

Moreover, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliateur, a request made by the

conciliateur to defer payment of its unmatured claim, the judge may defer or reschedule the payment of this
unmatured claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings (i.e. a maximum period of five months), whereas
claims that are due may be deferred in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code. The judge will take
his or her decision after having heard the conciliateur and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to
reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

The conciliation agreement reached between the debtor and its creditors and/or trade partners and/or other

stakeholders may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties,
which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents
any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation
agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force _exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings_
remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the court at the request of the debtor

following a hearing held for that purpose, to which the social and economic committee must be convened, if (i) the
debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii)
the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the
_conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. The approved conciliation_
agreement is subject to challenges by third parties (tierce opposition) and appeal by the public prosecutor or any
party to such conciliation agreement with respect to the New Money Lien. Such approval by the court will have the
same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition:

  - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial court, which should only disclose the amount
of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same,
will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the social and
economic committee that is informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to
the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court;

  - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services
designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new
equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and
post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of
subsequent safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings
or judicial liquidation proceedings;

  - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be
rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid
before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) or be affected by a debt-to-equity swap, not even by
the classes of affected parties;

  - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its
statutory auditors; and

  - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date
of insolvency, see “—Insolvency test,” and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (période
_suspecte) see “Void and Voidable Transactions,” in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings,_
cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement
by the court (except in case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the president of the court or the court

(depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the
_conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its_
performance and while it is in force:

A 28


-----

  - any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the rescheduling agreement
are suspended;

  - interest accruing on the affected claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

  - pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right, during the
performance period of a conciliation agreement, to petition the judge having commenced conciliation
proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation
proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on
notice to pay or who are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement,
such decision being made after hearing the conciliateur if he or she has been appointed to monitor the
implementation of the agreement, and taking into account the conditions of its performance; and

  - pursuant to Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor and a third party having
previously granted credit support (a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or security interest (sûreté réelle)) with
respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as
from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings and during the
performance of the conciliation agreement.

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or

the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such
termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely,
provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to
obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The
commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation
agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and
pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Nevertheless, the termination of the conciliation agreement does not
invalidate the provisions the purpose of which is to organize the consequences arising out of the termination of the
_conciliation agreement._

_Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a_

majority of creditors large enough to render likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in
safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad

_hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, in_
particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (Prepack sale - plan de cession) which would be
implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the
_mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial_
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.

As a matter of law, two types of contractual provisions are deemed null and void: (i) any provision that modifies

the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its
obligations simply by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation
proceedings or of a request submitted to this end and (ii) any provision forcing the debtor to bear, by reason only of
the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than threequarters of the fees of the professional advisers whom the creditors have retained in connection with these
proceedings.

Where the debtor cannot manage to reach an agreement with its creditors within the maximum time period

allotted to court-assisted proceedings, the proceedings will end automatically. The termination of amicable
proceedings does not, in and of itself entail specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result
in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced
enduring a three-month period following the termination of the previous ones.

**Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde)**

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard

proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent, — see “Insolvency
test.” In particular, as established by case law, to be granted the benefit of safeguard proceedings, the debtor cannot
be requested to characterize the difficulties as affecting its business activities. Where it is not demonstrated that the
debtor is experiencing difficulties that it is not able to overcome, the court may invite the debtor to request the
opening of conciliation proceedings. Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing
before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right
to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings through a third-party appeal.

Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur

_judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not_
necessary) within the list of judicial administrators (whose name can be proposed by the debtor or the public
prosecutor). At the request of the debtor or the public prosecutor, or by the court on its own, two or more
administrators can be appointed. The appointment of several administrators becomes mandatory when the debtor (i)
owns at least three establishments outside the jurisdiction of the court where it is registered, or (ii) holds or controls
(as provided by Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) at least two companies subject to
court-administered proceedings, or (iii) is held or controlled (as provided by the same articles) by a company subject
to court-administered proceedings, such company itself holding or controlling another company subject to such
proceedings, and (iv) generates at least €20 million of annual net turnover (for (ii) and (iii)). In case mandat ad hoc
or conciliation proceedings were commenced in the eighteen months preceding the commencement of courtadministered proceedings, the public prosecutor can object to the appointment of the mandataire ad hoc or
_conciliateur as administrator. The administrator is appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an_
“observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and
ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to
twelve months (a first six months period which can be renewed once at the request of either the debtor, the courtappointed administrator or the public prosecutor). The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the
debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors that
may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or Equity Holders (as defined below) do not have effective
control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed administrator.
The court-appointed administrator will either, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her,
exercise ex-post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor with
making some or all of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), under the supervision of the court.

A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also

appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Disposal decisions that
fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under
statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). The
supervisory judge can appoint one to five controllers (contrôleurs) among the creditors who have filed a request,
provided they meet certain conditions (in particular no affiliation to the debtor). Controllers (contrôleurs) assist the
creditors’ representative in his functions and the supervisory judge in his duty of supervising the progress of the
insolvency proceedings. In order to protect creditors’ interests and under certain conditions, the controllers may act
in the interests of the creditors when the creditors’ representative fails to take sufficient action.

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent, see “—Insolvency test,”

before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public
prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into
judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, at any time during the observation period, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i)

judicial reorganization proceedings (a) if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if no plan has been adopted, the approval of a
safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard
proceedings end, or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly
impossible.

The court may decide on the conversion upon its own initiative or at the request of the debtor, the administrator,

the creditors' representative or the public prosecutor, save in the case of (i) (b) above. In case of (i) (b) above, the

A 30


-----

court may decide the conversion (i) at the request of the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public
prosecutor if no draft plan was approved by the relevant classes of affected parties or (ii) at the sole request of the
debtor in all other circumstances.

In these two conversion cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court
appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the supervisory judge
as controllers (contrôleurs) (if any), the public prosecutor and the social and economic committee (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes

immediately due and payable.

Ordinance No. 2021-1193, dated September 15, 2021, created a new post money privilege as an incentive for

new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings (the “Post Money
Lien”).

The Post Money Lien applies exclusively to proceedings commenced from October 1, 2021. The Post Money

Lien also applies in the event of an amendment to the safeguard plan or reorganization plan adopted in proceedings
commenced before May 22, 2020.

The Post Money Lien is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the

approval of the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire), after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the
proceedings or of the observation period:

  - The Post Money Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through
a share capital increase, by any person:

    - in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability during the observation
period, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are
published, or

    - for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or
amended by the court, and for the purposes of its performance, it being specified that both the draft
plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote and the judgment must mention all claims
benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts.

  - Claims benefiting from the Post Money Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and
post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims, procedural costs, claims benefiting of the New Money Lien as defined
above and pre-petition claims secured by a real estate security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings
only)) in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or
judicial liquidation proceedings.

  - The Post Money Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to
commencement of the proceedings.

  - Such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors (although
such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) in subsequent
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings.

Once safeguard proceedings have been commenced, there will be an automatic stay on certain claims. Payment

by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement
of the safeguard proceedings and if they do not relate to expenses necessary for the debtor’s business activities
during the observation period, are not for the requirements of the proceedings, or not in consideration for services
rendered or goods delivered to the debtor during this period is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For
example, the supervisory judge can authorize payments for pre-commencement debts in order to discharge a lien on
property needed to continue the debtor’s operation or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a
fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire), see “—Status of Creditors.” This automatic stay does not apply to claims

A 31


-----

secured by a security interest conferring a retention right, claims assigned by way of Dailly assignment of
receivables and claims secured by a trust (fiducie).

During the safeguard proceedings, any increase in the perimeter of a contractual security interest or a

contractual right of retention, regardless of the method used, is prohibited. Consequently, margin call provisions are
neutralized. This prohibition does not apply to any assignment of receivables as set forth in Articles 313-23 et. seq.
of the French Monetary and Financial Code if the framework master agreement was entered into before the
commencement of the proceedings.

Creditors (and, if applicable, Equity Holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities

will be settled under the plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being
approved by the court. The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business.

Liabilities to be taken into account in the draft plan shall include, provided that they are established on the basis

of a certificate prepared by a chartered accountant or the statutory auditor, those claims admitted and not challenged
as well as those “identifiable”.

_Standard consultation: for debtors which have, on the date of the petition for the commencement of the_

proceedings, (i) less than 250 employees and less than an annual net turnover of at least €20 million or (ii) less than
an annual net turnover of at least €40 million. This also applies in respect of debtors which own or control other
entities within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, who fall below these
thresholds. If so requested by the debtor and with the consent of the supervisory judge, creditors may also be subject
to the class-based consultation.

In the framework of a standard consultation, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts

to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim,
regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether

the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation stage. According to legal commentaries
and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors
is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed
creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial
payment of the claim over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claim over the length of the plan
(ten year maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum if fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is

approved do not need to be consulted.

Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for
equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the
responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to

them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of
their claims (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien
or the Post Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the
maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in
which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be
imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting

the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be at least 5% of the amount
of each claim and from the sixth year onwards, at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first
payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the
plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she
been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

A 32


-----

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the

shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access
to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of
the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the
shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual applicable legal provisions relating to
quorum and majority shall apply.

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share

capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced
according to the provisions of the plan).

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period (which cannot exceed the duration of the plan)

during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be
disposed of without the court’s consent.

The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is

substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted
by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to
this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance
of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps.

**_Class-based Consultation_**

This applies to large companies with, on the date of the petition for commencement of the proceedings, (i) at

least 250 employees and an annual net turnover of at least €20 million or (ii) with an annual net turnover of at least
€40 million, in both cases on a standalone basis or together with other entities they hold or control, within the
meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, or, in the case of a debtor that does not
meet the aforementioned thresholds, upon said debtor’s request and with the consent of the supervisory judge.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the

assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties affectées),
as defined below.

Are considered as “affected parties” (i) any creditors whose rights are directly affected by the restructuring plan,

or (ii) any stakeholders which hold an instrument giving access either immediately or on a deferred basis to the
debtor’s share capital (the “Equity Holders”) in the event of their stake in the debtor’s capital, the debtor’s articles of
association, or such stakeholder’s rights are modified by the draft plan.

Only the affected parties can vote on the draft plan.

The affected parties shall inform the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire), within 10 days

from receipt of the notice sent by the court-appointed administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the
affected parties to notify the existence, of any intercreditor or subordination agreements entered into before the
commencement of the proceedings, of any such intercreditor or subordination. Failing this, these agreements are
unenforceable towards the proceedings.

The composition of the classes of affected parties are determined in light of the claims and rights arising prior to

the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings. The court-appointed administrator divides the affected
parties into classes, which reflect sufficient commonality of economic interest, based on objective and verifiable
criteria, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:

  - creditors holding security interests over the debtor’s assets, for their secured claims, and unsecured
creditors are members of separate classes;

  - composition of classes respects intercreditor agreements concluded before the commencement of the
proceedings;

  - Equity Holders and creditors are treated as separate classes

A 33


-----

  - Creditors that share sufficient commonalty of economic interest will be in the same class and shall benefit
from equal treatment under the plan.

Claims arising under employment contracts, pension rights acquired under a professional retirement scheme and

essential needs claims (créances alimentaires) are excluded from the class-based consultation and therefore are not
affected by the plan.

At least 21 days before the date of the vote on the draft plan, the court-appointed administrator must submit to

each affected party the rules governing the class formation criteria and the voting rights with respect to the class or
classes to which affected parties belong and the claims or rights that enable them to cast a vote. The amount of the
claims taken into account shall be the amount indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor or, where
no statutory auditor has been appointed, established by its chartered accountant. In the case of affected parties which
are beneficiaries of a trust (fiducie) set up as a guarantee by the debtor, only the amounts of their claims not
guaranteed by such a security shall be taken into account. Where there is an indexation clause, the amount of interest
remaining due on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings is calculated at the rate applicable on the
date of that judgment. Foreign currency receivables are converted into euros at the exchange rate on the date of the
judgment. In the event of disagreement, each affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors’
representative or the court-appointed administrator can challenge the rules governing the class formation criteria or
the voting rights before the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire), within 10 days from the notification or
publication of such rules.

The supervisory judge must rule on such challenge within 10 days. In the absence of a decision by the

supervisory judge in the 10 days period, the matter may be referred to the court. Appeal against the supervisory
judge’s decision (or the court’s decision as the case may be) has to be filed within 5 days of its notification to the
parties. The court of appeal then has 15 days to rule. There is no possibility to submit a challenge before the French
Supreme Court.

The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties

concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial
administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree.

The debtor, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of preparing the draft plan. The

draft plan shall be sent to the classes for a vote of affected parties for a vote. Affected parties may not submit
alternative draft plans. The draft plan may, in particular, provide for rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or
debt-for-equity swaps. Where the thresholds applicable to specialized commercial courts are not met, the debtor’s
Equity Holders which are affected by the draft plan can make a non-monetary contribution to the restructuring (e.g.
by providing their experience, reputation or professional contacts). The classes of affected parties must approve or
reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the
supervisory judge upon request from the debtor or the court-appointed administrator but may never be shorter than
15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each class of affected parties (two-thirds of the votes held
by the members casting a vote).

The class or classes of Equity Holders vote in accordance with the provisions applicable to either extraordinary

general meetings, shareholders’ meetings and special meetings or bondholders’ general meetings, as the case may
be, except that the decision is taken at the same two-third majority. Within a class, the vote on the adoption of the
plan may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation with its members, has received the approval of twothirds of the voting rights. There are no quorum requirements, including for classes of Equity Holders.

When the classes have adopted the draft plan, the court rules upon it and verifies that the following conditions

are met:

  - the plan has been adopted in accordance with the rules regarding the affected parties and their classification
into classes;

  - the affected parties sharing a sufficient community of interest within the same class benefit from equal
treatment and are treated in proportion to their claim or right;

  - all affected parties have been duly notified of the plan;

A 34


-----

  - if some affected parties have voted against the draft plan, none of these affected parties is worse off under
the restructuring plan than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were
applied, either in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event
of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not confirmed (the “Best Interest of
**Creditors Test”). If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best**
Interest of Creditors Test, the court will determine the value of the company on a going concern basis;

  - where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair
the interests of the affected parties.

The court may refuse to approve the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s

insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The court must check that the interests of all creditors are
“sufficiently protected”. The judgement adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (including the
affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the

shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted
claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan).

If the plan is not approved by the required majority of each class of affected parties, it may be approved (arrêté)

by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor and be
imposed on the parties that voted against the draft plan (“Cross-Class Cram-Down”), where the plan meets the
following conditions:

  - the plan complies with the conditions for the adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above;

  - the plan has been approved by:

    - a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, including at least one class of secured
creditors or a class ranking higher than the class of unsecured creditors; or, if such condition is not met,

    - by at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than a class of Equity Holders or
any other class which, after determination of the value of the debtor as a going concern, it may
reasonably be assumed it would not be entitled to any payment, if the order of priority payments in
judicial liquidation proceedings were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a courtordered sale plan (plan de cession));

  - the claims of a dissenting class of affected creditors shall be paid in full (by identical or equivalent means)
if a more junior class receives any distribution or keeps any interest under the restructuring plan (the
“absolute priority rule”). However, at the request of (i) the debtor or (ii) the court-appointed administrator
with the agreement of the debtor, the court may decide to deviate from the application of the absolute
priority rule where such deviations are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan and
where such restructuring plan does not excessively prejudice the rights or interest of any affected party. In
particular, claims of the debtor’s suppliers of goods or services, the Equity Holders and claims arising from
the debtors’ tort liability may receive special treatment;

  - under the safeguard plan, no class of affected parties may receive or retain more than the total amount of its
claims or interests;

  - in the case of one or more dissenting classes of Equity Holders:

    - the formation of classes of affected parties was compulsory regarding the thresholds met by the debtor
(i.e., 250 employees and an annual net turnover of at least €20 million or with an annual net turnover
of at least €40 million at the group level);

    - it may reasonably be assumed, after determination of the value of the debtor as a going concern, that
the dissenting classes of Equity Holders would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if

A 35


-----

the order of priority of payments in judicial liquidation proceedings were applied (whether in the event
of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession));

    - if the draft plan provides for a share capital increase subscribed in cash (including by way of set off
with payable claims), the shares to be issued are offered in preference to the existing shareholders, in
proportion to the part of the share capital represented by their shares;

    - the plan does not provide for the sale of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of
Equity Holders (only forced dilution is possible).

The decision of the court shall constitute approval of the changes to the shareholding structure or to the rights of

the Equity Holders or to the articles of association provided for in the plan. The court may appoint judicial
representative to carry out the acts necessary for the implementation of these amendments.

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set up a time
period (which cannot exceed the duration of the plan) during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the
continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent.

At the latest within 10 days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted

against the draft plan and considering that:

  - the Best Interest of Creditors Test criterion has not been met; or

  - the condition relating to the adoption of the draft plan by at least one of the classes of affected parties
entitled to vote (other than a class of Equity Holders or any other class which, after determining the value
of the debtor as a going concern, it is reasonable to assume would not be entitled to any payment if the
order of payment in a judicial liquidation was applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a courtordered sale plan)) has not been met; or

  - in the event of a cross class-cram-down on Equity Holders, the condition relating to the debtor’s value
criterion has not been met (i.e., it is reasonable to assume, after determining the value of the debtor as a
going concern, that the Equity Holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any
payment or retain any interest if the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation was applied
(whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, of a court-ordered sale plan)), may petition the court to dispute
the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the
same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the
appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption
of the plan.

This decision may be appealed under the ordinary procedure by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged

the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor,
within 10 days from its notification (or of its communication if the appeal was lodged by the public prosecutor). The
decision of the court of appeal may be challenged before the French Supreme Court.

In case of failure to adopt the plan in safeguard proceedings, the alternatives are either the termination of these

proceedings or the conversion into judicial reorganization proceedings. The imposition of an alternative plan and
payment terms is not possible.

Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security

and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to
those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar
position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or
relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local
administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from
all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or
fines.

A 36


-----

Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the court
appointed administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties
called upon to vote on the proposed plan.

**Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde Accélérée)**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard

proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée). The accelerated safeguard proceedings are designed to “fasttrack” difficulties faced by any debtor under Ordinance No. 2021-1193 dated September 15, 2021.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require the classes of affected parties to be constituted, the court

opening accelerated safeguard proceedings must order such formation. In that regard, the court shall authorize such
constitution for the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings.

To be eligible for accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

  - its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or drawn-up by a
chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable);

  - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of
the proceedings;

  - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going
concern which is supported by enough affected parties involved in the proceedings to render its adoption by
the relevant classes of affected parties likely within a maximum of two months, extendable for two months,
following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings;

  - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement
of conciliation proceedings; and

  - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a
position to overcome.

The opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings only has effects with regards to the affected parties, i.e. those

parties directly affected by the draft safeguard plan prepared by the debtor in the context of its conciliation
proceedings.

When the debtor’s accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan will be adopted

only by creditors having the status of finance companies, credit institutions and equivalent (i.e. those institutions (i)
referred to in Articles L. 511-1 and L. 518-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et
_financier), (ii) operating under the freedom establishment or the freedom to provide services in the territory of the_
States parties to the agreement on the European Economic Area mentioned in Book V of the French Monetary and
Financial Code and (iii) any other entity with which the debtor has entered into a credit transaction, the “Financial
Institution”), as well as by all holders of a claim acquired from them or from a supplier of goods or services and,
where applicable, bondholders, the debtor may request the commencement of safeguard proceedings, the effects of
which are limited to these creditors. In such case, creditors that are not concerned by the procedure are therefore not
affected by the plan. Such creditors will neither be subject to majority rules, nor to the rescheduling or cancellation
of their debts.

The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard proceedings

apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the
proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or
the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement
non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan
and in accordance with its terms. The other creditors’ debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary
course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings in relation to the constitution of classes of affected

parties is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (for example, affected parties will be consulted by

A 37


-----

way of a class-based consultation on a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée))
and affected parties may not prepare alternative draft plans as described above, see “—Class-based consultation,” to
the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings
is four months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial two-month period).

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not

apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in

standard safeguard proceedings when classes of affected parties are set up and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent).

If a plan is not adopted by the affected parties and approved by the court within the applicable deadlines, the

court shall terminate the proceedings. If the debtor then becomes insolvent, it must file for judicial reorganization
(redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

The list of claims (which shall also mention the subordination agreements communicated to the debtor by the

creditors prior to the opening of the insolvency proceeding) of affected parties to the conciliation proceedings
established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant shall be deemed to
constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings, unless the affected parties
otherwise elect to make such a filing, see “— Status of Creditors” below.

**Judicial Reorganization (Procédure de Redressement Judiciaire) or Judicial Liquidation (Procédure de**
**_Liquidation Judiciaire)_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may be

initiated against (i.e., by the public prosecutor or by a creditor, whether secured or unsecured and regardless of the
amount of its claims) or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, with respect to liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings. If it
does not, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil
liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after

having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the
commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings. The same would apply if the debtor requested the
commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings
would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the
court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public
prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert reorganization proceedings into liquidation proceedings
if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after
having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public
prosecutor and the social and economic committee (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of

employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of

share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually

appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to
18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the
reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar
to a safeguard plan) or, unlike safeguard proceedings, if it appears that a reorganization plan is not possible, the sale
of the business (which will occur through an open bid process organized by the administrator) or the liquidation of
the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission
_d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission_

A 38


-----

_d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard_
proceedings, subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial

reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are
similar, subject to certain exceptions including:

  - if the debtor does not meet the required thresholds, the authorization to form classes of affected parties may
also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator, without the debtor’s
approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor);

  - any affected party may also prepare a reorganization draft plan which shall be submitted, together with the
plan drafted by the debtor, to a vote of the classes of affected parties at the latest 15 days before the date of
the vote;

  - if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers,
prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void;

  - if the classes of affected parties do not approve the reorganization plan, it may be approved (arrêté) by the
court at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator (with the debtor’s consent), or the
court-appointed administrator with the approval of one affected party and be imposed on the classes that
voted against the draft plan (the “Cross-Class Cram-Down”), where the plan meets the conditions of the
Cross-Class Cram-Down mechanism;

  - if the reorganization plan is not adopted by the classes of affected parties or according to the Cross-Class
Cram-Down mechanism, the ability to impose an alternative plan according to the classic individual
consultation and impose payment terms by the court is possible (following individual consultation, the
court can impose a term-out plan on dissenting creditors for up to ten years).

At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the appointed

administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor, or at its own initiative,
order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its
recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided
by the court.

In addition, Ordinance No. 2021-1193, dated September 15, 2021 modified, the judicial reorganization

proceedings to provide for the new Post Money Lien (as defined and detailed above, see “—Safeguard Proceedings
(Procédure de Sauvegarde”)).

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in the framework of individual standard consultation, in case a

shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share
capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may
appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the
shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders
that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the
equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no

reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total
or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the

meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local
employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid
harm to the national or regional economy and allows the continued operation of the business as a going concern,
then at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options
for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision

A 39


-----

commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the
company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the
insolvency court may either:

  - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital
increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the
reorganization plan; or

  - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part
of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding,
directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights
(including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s
shareholders’ meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right
to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be simultaneously purchased by the transferees.
Any consent clause (clause d'agrément) is deemed unwritten.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be

set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders

to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization
plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is

generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial
liquidation proceedings, nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation
proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations
(mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are
sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). Managers are no longer in possession.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation

scenario, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors:

  - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the_
business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the
business as a going-concern via an asset sale, known as a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as
construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s
business;

  - as part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real
estate assets, jobs, and contracts) without the liabilities pertaining to them (with exceptions). The price
offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount
compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the
sustainability of the business as a going concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of
creditors.

  - subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including
secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to
release their security interests. By way of exception:

    - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted
financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of
the business plan, provided that such creditors have filed their claims. In this case, the debtor is
released from the payment of these remaining installments;

A 40


-----

    - the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the
outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as
set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and

    - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over
inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets for
example) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right
(and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless
reaching an agreement with the relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors

subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to
insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in
_bonis market value;_

  - separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the insolvency judge (liquidateur) may
decide to:

    - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

    - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have
been received (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale
agreement with the bidder); or

    - request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on
each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit
their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing
(procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by
certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the

continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when (a) there are no remaining due liabilities and the liquidator has

sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or (b) the continuation of the liquidation process
becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is

disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets or in the event where there are insufficient funds to
pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the
amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

Law n°2021-689 May 31, 2021 has introduced a new insolvent procedure available until June 2, 2023, which is

called “procédure de traitement de sortie de crise” and can be summarized as an accelerated and simplified judicial
reorganization proceedings for small undertaking, i.e. undertakings that have less than 20 employees and whose
reported liability amount excluding equity is lower than 3 million euros. As a result, its regime will not be discussed
further herein.

**_Void and Voidable Transactions_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order

commencing proceedings, unless, in this decision or a subsequent one, the court sets an earlier date, which may be
no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency is important because it marks the
beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the date of insolvency of the debtor to
the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

A 41


-----

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void by the court (the court must

declare these transactions void on petition by the administrator, the insolvency judge, the public prosecutor, or the
plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) or voidable by the court (subject to the court’s
discretionary decision on petition by the administrator, the insolvency judge, the public prosecutor, or the plan
commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)).

  - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period
that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts
under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party,
payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due not made in cash, wire
transfer, remittance of negotiable instruments, Dailly assignment of receivables or any other means
commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a
court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance
with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), contractual security interest or contractual rights of
retention constituted on the debtor’s assets or rights guaranteeing debts having previously incurred (unless
they replace a security interest having at least the same nature and perimeter and with the exception of the
_Dailly assignment of a claim provided for in Articles L. 313-23 et seq. of the French Monetary and_
Financial Code, made in performance of a framework agreement concluded prior to the date of cessation of
payments), for debts having previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures
_conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), any grant, exercise, or_
resale relating to stock options made under Article L. 225-177 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the
transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a
debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights
already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized
declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 5261 of the French Commercial Code and, any statutory mortgage attached to judgments of condemnation
constituted over the assets of the debtor for debts previously incurred and any assignment (or change in the
assignment of the assets) resulting in the impoverishment of the debtor's assets to the benefit of another
debtor's estate.

  - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for
consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if_
the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the
relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations
of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the
French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the
beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the
court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside
transactions that are only “voidable.” In addition, pursuant Article L. 632-1 of the French Commercial
Code, the court may declare null and void any acts transferring the ownership of asset without any
consideration and any notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration
_d’insaisissabilité) entered into within six months prior to the date of insolvency (date de cessation des_
_paiements)._

Third party rights, including bona fide third parties, can be affected by those voidance provisions.

There is no hardening period prior to successful safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Status of Creditors_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the

debt or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are
“contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or
increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in
accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) dated January 14, 2014, No. 12-22.909
regarding a judicial reorganization proceedings and in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court

dated February 22, 2017, No 15-15.942 regarding a safeguard proceedings, which case law may be extended to
accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, except in accelerated safeguard proceedings and judicial liquidation
proceedings where the continued operation of the business has not been ordered by the court, the court-appointed
administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor
will not be able to continue to perform. The court-appointed administrator can, conversely, require that other parties
to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the
condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the
case of reorganization or liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on
delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a
debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a
“plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once),
in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan
for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

  - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be
compounded);

  - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision commencing the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts
and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be
pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate
(patrimoine fiduciaire)) required by the continued operation of the business or to pay a carrier requesting
payment directly from the debtor);

  - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless
they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of
services rendered/goods provided to the debtor, security interests can be granted as regards such debts the
payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge;

  - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of
the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the
debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over
debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as
claims secured by a New Money Lien or a Post Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the
attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire),
or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)
or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

  - creditors (or beneficiaries of a security interest over tangible asset granted by a third-party to secure the
debt of the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor or against a
guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person with respect to any claim arising prior to
the court decision commencing the proceedings in the framework of a safeguard, an accelerated safeguard
or a reorganization proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

    - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described
below);

    - to terminate a contract for non-payment of pre-opening amounts owed to the creditor; or

    - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third
party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for
judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset - whether
tangible or intangible, movable or immovable - is located in another EU Member State within the
European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the

A 43


-----

insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are commenced in such EU Member
State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU
would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the
local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France
is a party).

  - any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means
whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or
proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary
provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on
the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of
commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest
may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to
a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary
provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary
and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) or the French Insurance Code (Code des assurances);
and

  - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment,
immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), will be
required.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (plan

_de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) adopted by the court._

In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the

proceedings. Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the
ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims and securities arose prior to the

commencement of proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within
two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin officiel des annonces civiles et
_commerciales) (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose_
claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to
four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France.

Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the

two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims or
securities have not been submitted during the relevant period, or claims that are not deemed filed with the creditors’
representative, are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the
proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law.

In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must

also file a statement of claim with the creditors representative under the same conditions.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the

creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of
the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof
of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) rules on the admissibility of the
claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard proceedings, however the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken

part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its chartered certified
accountant). Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail
themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the

A 44


-----

list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the
_conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines._

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors

included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor whether partial (within the

frame of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings) or total (within the frame of reorganization or
liquidation proceedings), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according
to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint
a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling its
debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency legislation assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including

employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court official fees), creditors who benefit from a New
Money Lien or a Post Money Lien, post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social
charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose
claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does
not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with
respect to their claim related to such asset.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,

judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable
for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor on the following grounds (and may only be held
liable on those grounds) provided that such grant was itself wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a
fraud, or (ii) wrongfully interfered (immixtion caractérisée) with the management of the debtor or (iii) obtained
security or guarantees taken to support the facilities being disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any
security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these
grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of

such company. In such case, Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation
proceedings have been commenced against the debtor, such creditor being deemed de facto manager may be liable
bearing the excess of liabilities over the company's assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de
_facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of_
assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the
shortfall amount. However, the liabilities of the company shall not be borne by the managers in case of “simple
negligence” (simple négligence).

**_Rights in the Collateral may be Adversely Affected by the Failure to Perfect Security Interests in the Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,

through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral
securing the notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the notes if we, or the Notes Collateral Agent,
fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that
neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any
of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form of a stock company
(société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de
_compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be_
validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers)
by each security provider in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered
in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of
a French guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered
(such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security
interest if it is not publicly registered.

**Limitations on Enforcement of Security Interests and Cash Amount (“soulte”)**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and

unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in
the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the
secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale
being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court-appointed
expert in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or judicially-appointed expert in the
context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured
creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the
securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of
proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the

relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with

applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price
received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a
competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the
basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or
groups of companies.

**_Approval of the French Regulatory Authorities in Order to Allow the Notes Collateral Agent to Enforce the_**
**_Pledges over the Shares of a French Entity_**

In addition, it should be noted that foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain

sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment, products or services which are critical to the interests of
France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, in particular in the areas of energy and water
supply, public health, public transport and electronic communication) may require the prior authorization of the
French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a
business. Where any of the sectors specified by law or regulations are involved, the following shall constitute
foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure:

  - a transaction as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of
Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business (branche d’activité)
or (iii) crosses the threshold of 33.33 percent of the share capital or voting rights, in each case of a
company whose registered office is located in France;

  - a transaction as a result of which an EU/EEA investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of
Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business, in either case of a
company whose registered office is located in France; and

  - a transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control acquires all or part of a
business of a company whose registered office is located in France.

When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction

cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior
authorization to the French authorities which must render a decision within 30 business days of receipt of the
application (failing which authorization shall not be deemed to have been granted). The decision can grant or not the
authorization or condition its obtainment to further examination (examen complémentaire) by the French authorities.

A 46


-----

In the event of further examination (examen complémentaire) the French authorities must render a decision

within 45 business days of receipt of the decision conditioning the obtainment of the authorization to further
examination (examen complémentaire) (failing which authorization shall be deemed not to have been granted).

We can provide no assurance that the approval of the French authorities would not be required in order to allow

the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the applicable Trustee) to enforce the pledge over the shares of
the French guarantor or that such approval, if required, would be granted.

In addition to these limitations, specific insolvency-related limitations may prevent the enforcement of security

interests in the context of court-assisted or court-administered proceedings.

**_Parallel Debt—Trust_**

Furthermore, in order to permit the beneficial holders of the notes to benefit from a secured claim, the

applicable financing documents may provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the applicable
Notes Collateral Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors (as principal
obligors) towards the holders of the notes under or in connection with the indenture (the “principal obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the principal

obligations. Any payment in respect of the principal obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and
any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Pursuant to the
Parallel Debt, the applicable Notes Collateral Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by
an obligor under the notes. The pledges governed by French law will be granted in favor of the Collateral Agent on
behalf of the secured creditors and will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations
under the notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to
take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Trustee under the applicable
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the indenture) provide instruction to the applicable Notes Collateral
Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms

(Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York
law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in
safeguard proceedings) of a collateral agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court
upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French
international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French
debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although
this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as recognition by French courts of
Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all
cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of
claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is
also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should
not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting
from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of
unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the notes or security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the applicable Notes

Collateral Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged
by other parties, holders of the notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement
of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the notes will bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the applicable Notes Collateral Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code by Article 792-0 bis of the French Code

_général des impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published_
decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed
under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard
proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has
not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the
concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

A 47


-----

**_Constitution of Collateral_**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuers under the notes and the

obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes but will be
granted in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent. The indenture and the intercreditor agreements will provide that only
the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the applicable Trustee) have the right to enforce the security
documents. As a consequence, holders of the notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indentures, who will (subject to the provisions of the indenture) provide instructions to the Notes Collateral Agent
for the Collateral.

The beneficial holders of interests in the notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents.

Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such
security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties
who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as agent (mandataire) under Article 1984 et. seq. of the French
Civil Code, as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des
_sûretés) under Article 2488-6 et. seq. of the French Civil Code._

**_Priority of a Pledge over a Securities Account_**

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the

relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company which
are held by the grantor are credited. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not
registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company
are credited.

**_Priority of a Pledge over the Bank Accounts and Receivables_**

The pledges over the bank accounts and receivables are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are

available for security interests, which are not registered, such as pledges over bank accounts and receivables. As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts or receivables of a
debtor.

**_Assumption as to the Enforceability of Lower-Ranking Pledges over the Bank Accounts_**

By way of background, a pledge over bank accounts is a variant of a pledge over receivables. Since the reform

of security law introduced by Ordinance No. 2021-1192 of September 15, 2021, which entered into effect on
January 1[st], 2022, French law recognizes that a grantor of a pledge over present or future receivables could grant
lower ranking pledges over those receivables. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and no
assurance can be given on its concrete application.

**_French Guarantee and Security Interest Subject to Subject to the Validity and Enforceability of the_**
**_Guaranteed Obligations_**

Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the validity and enforceability of guarantees (including any related

security interests) are subject to the validity and enforceability of the guaranteed obligations. Notwithstanding the
fact that certain jurisdictions may recognize independent guarantees, to the extent the parallel debt claim and/or the
obligations of the applicable Issuer in relation to the notes are invalidated, the obligations of a Guarantor under the
relevant guarantees and the collateral may also be invalidated.

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

The liability of a French guarantor are subject to:

  - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited
financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or
infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code or
any other law or regulations having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts; and

A 48

  - French corporate benefit rules.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the guarantee

must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company incorporated as a société anonyme or a société par actions

_simplifiée is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for_
the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an real and adequate corporate benefit from the

transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return
the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that these criteria were not fulfilled. Existence of corporate
benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

French law has recognized that certain inter-group transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the

corporate interest of the guarantor, in particular, where the following four criteria are fulfilled:

  - the existence of a genuine group of companies under a common strategy working towards a common
objective and the guarantee and the transaction to which it relates, must be entered into in the common
economic intent of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate of
such group benefit;

  - the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

  - the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is commensurate to such group benefit; and

  - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Note Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are

commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be

limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or
indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to
that French guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding
on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes guarantees. Any payment
made by such French Guarantor under its Notes guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall
reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries
under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s
obligation under the Notes guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or
a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes guarantees.

**_Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de

_cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the First Lien Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Article L.626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of
safeguard proceedings (applicable in judicial reorganization proceedings), the safeguard plan which is put to the
vote of the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination
agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings. As
a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this offering memorandum, has
received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions
of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of insolvency

proceedings, called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease
in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant
to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of the relevant person by, as the case may be, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed
commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the restructuring plan (commissaire à l’exécution du
_plan) of the relevant debtor, or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act_
in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all creditors of the
relevant debtor (if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the courtappointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan
(commissaire à _l’exécution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the claim was lodged by such creditor) if: (i) the_
person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, (in the case of a claim
lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of
overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) in the
case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence
of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or
should have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their
means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a
court found that the issuance of the notes, the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not
qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the notes, the granting of such guarantee could be
declared unenforceable (i) declared unenforceable against all the creditors if the claim was lodged by the creditors’
representative (mandataire _judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the_
implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or (ii) declared
unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful
challenges, the noteholders may not enjoy the benefit of the notes, the guarantees and the value of any consideration
that the noteholders received with respect to the notes, the guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the
noteholders and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, the noteholders might
be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Note Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

**_Enforcement of Judgements_**

Certain of the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or principal

places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities
are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of
the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible
for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S.
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States.
However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities,
provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims

connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals.

The U.S. and France currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of

judgments (other than arbitral awards rendered in commercial matters and, with respect to France, awards rendered
in the United States civil matters). Consequently, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United
States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was
rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (tribunal
_judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte)_

A 50


-----

proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under
prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

  - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having “indirect” jurisdiction over the matter as this concept is
defined by French courts in the context of enforcement of foreign judgments, meaning that the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such courts, the choice of the U.S. courts is not fraudulent and the
French courts did not have exclusive jurisdictions over the matter;

  - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules (“ordre public
_international”), both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case including fundamental_
procedural rights; and

  - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e.

those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should
not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no
proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the
same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res

judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France.
However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under

certain circumstances by, among others, (i) French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law
No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial, or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons, the communication of which could harm the sovereignty, security or essential economic
interests of France or contravening public policy) completed by Decree N 2022-207 of February 18, 2022, and (ii)
by French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 and Decree No. 2018-1126 relating to the protection of trade secrets,
as amended from time to time, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons
in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of
January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as mainly modified by French laws No.
2018-493 of June 20, 2018, No. 2021-998 of July 30, 2021 and No. 2021-1017 of August 2, 2021, Decrees No.
2018-687 of August 3, 2018 and No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, as well as French Ordinances No. 2018-1125 of
December 12, 2018 and No. 2019-964 of September 18, 2019) could limit under certain circumstances the
possibility of obtaining information in France and from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law if

its application contravenes French international public policy. Further, in case of an action brought in France on the
basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an

individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (Article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant
before French courts (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a
French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction
other than French courts. However, since a 2006 decision, the French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is
no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has
sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, the French national
may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of

December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to
French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the

A 51


-----

privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless
of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU.

Also, in 2012, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) held that a contractual provision submitting one

party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any
competent jurisdiction was invalid. Although this solution has since been tempered by subsequent French case law,
any provisions to the same or similar effect in any relevant documents might not be binding on the party submitted
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Hong Kong**

**_Insolvency and Other Limitations_**

Certain Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Hong Kong. Insolvency proceedings with respect to a guarantor

incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong (a “Hong Kong Guarantor”) may be commenced in Hong Kong and, if
so, will be based on Hong Kong insolvency laws.

In the event of a liquidation of the Hong Kong Guarantor under Hong Kong laws, liquidators will realize

available assets (being the assets remaining after secured creditors have enforced on any valid security interests) for
the benefit of the Hong Kong Guarantor’s creditors and contributories. Provided the notes remain to be guaranteed
on a senior secured basis, payments will be made to holders of the notes as senior secured creditors (pari passu with
Hong Kong Guarantor’s creditors holding indebtedness secured by a lien of the same ranking in terms of seniority
on the Collateral owned by the Hong Kong Guarantor) to the extent of the value of the Collateral owned by the
Hong Kong Guarantor, subject to payment of all other claims entitled to priority under Hong Kong insolvency laws.

Subject to the parties’ agreement on the ranking of the holders’ claims, any interest accruing under or with

respect to amounts due under a guarantee provided by the Hong Kong Guarantor with respect to any period after the
commencement of liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable by the holders of the notes from any surplus
remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the liquidation proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up
to the date of the winding-up order or the date the Hong Kong Guarantor passes a resolution to be voluntarily wound
up.

Under Hong Kong law, a company incorporated in Hong Kong (the “Hong Kong Company”) or any of its

subsidiaries is prohibited from providing “financial assistance” (as defined in section 274 of the Companies
Ordinance (Cap. 622 of the laws of Hong Kong) (the “Companies Ordinance”)) for the acquisition of shares in the
Hong Kong Company or for the purpose of reducing or discharging a liability incurred for the purpose of such
acquisition, unless the transaction falls within the permitted exceptions under the Companies Ordinance or the
giving of the financial assistance is authorized by one of the relevant procedures provided under the Companies
Ordinance.

If the Hong Kong Guarantor’s profits available for distribution are less than the value of the notes, the guarantee

provided by the Hong Kong Guarantor may be challenged as an unauthorized distribution to its shareholder.

Under applicable Hong Kong law relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, such as those relating to

preferences, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or insolvency affecting a Hong Kong company or its assets,
a guarantee or collateral granted by a Hong Kong company may be voided. For example, without limitation:

  - a guarantee or collateral granted by a Hong Kong company may constitute an unfair preference if it is
influenced by a desire to prefer the beneficiary, and it puts the beneficiary in a better position in the event
of insolvency of the Hong Kong company than it would otherwise have been in. A guarantee or collateral
may be an unfair preference if it is granted during the six month period before the winding up is
commenced, but this can be extended to a two year period if the beneficiary of the guarantee or collateral is
an associate (as defined under applicable Hong Kong law) of the relevant Hong Kong company;

  - if a Hong Kong company enters into a transaction with a person at an undervalue (and receives no
consideration or consideration which is significantly less than the consideration provided by the Hong
Kong company), then the transaction may be set aside. For the transaction to be set aside, it must have been
entered into in the five-year period before the Hong Kong company’s winding up is commenced;

A 52


-----

  - transactions made with the intention to defraud creditors or for a fraudulent purpose may be set aside. A
liquidator, creditor or other person thereby prejudiced may apply to the court for relief. For example, a
transaction can be set aside if the liquidator establishes that it took place with the aim of placing assets
beyond the reach of creditors; and

  - a floating charge granted by a Hong Kong company shall be invalid if the relevant charge was created in a
twelve-month period (or two year period, if the charge was granted in favor of a person connected (as
determined in accordance with applicable Hong Kong laws) with the Hong Kong company) ending on the
date of commencement of the liquidation of the Hong Kong company and such company was already
insolvent at the time of creating the floating charge (or as a result of having created the floating charge).

**_Enforcement of Judgments_**

It may be difficult for you to effect service of process upon the Hong Kong Guarantors or enforce against the

Hong Kong Guarantors judgments obtained outside Hong Kong.

We have been advised by Fangda Partners, our Hong Kong counsel, that the United States and Hong Kong have

not entered into any bilateral reciprocal enforcement agreement providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. A final judgment for the payment of money rendered by
any federal or state court of the United States would not be automatically enforceable in Hong Kong. A judgment in
personam obtained in a court of the United States may be enforceable in Hong Kong at common law provided that:

  - the judgment is for a definite sum of money (other than a sum of money payable in respect of taxes or
penalties);

  - the judgment is final and conclusive between the parties;

  - the relevant court from which the judgment was obtained had proper jurisdiction over the parties according
to Hong Kong conflict of law rules;

  - the judgment was not obtained by fraud or obtained in proceedings which contravene the rules of natural
justice;

  - enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy in Hong Kong;

  - the defendant in the proceedings was duly served with the process of a court of the United States or the
proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were not otherwise opposed to natural justice;

  - the proceeding was between the same parties as those before the courts in Hong Kong;

  - the bringing of the proceedings in a court of the United States was not contrary to a valid and binding
agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts
of the United States;

  - the person against whom the judgment was given did (a) bring or agree to the bringing of those proceedings
in a court in the United States and (b) counterclaim in the proceedings or otherwise submit to the
jurisdiction of that court; and

  - all Hong Kong common law and procedural requirements are met and no grounds exist which cause such
judgment to be impeached or rendered unenforceable by the courts of Hong Kong.

**Sweden**

**_Insolvency_**

One Note Guarantor of the notes is incorporated under the laws of Sweden (the “Swedish Guarantor”) and, as

such, any insolvency proceedings applicable to such Swedish Guarantor including any and all of its assets will as a
starting point and by virtue of Article 7 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation be governed by Swedish insolvency
law. However, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, where a Swedish company conducts business in

A 53


-----

more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the Swedish courts may be limited if the
company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a member state other than Sweden. There are a number of
factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of main interests, which should correspond to the place
where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third
parties. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are
opened.

**_Priority of Certain Creditors_**

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in relation

to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, according to the Swedish Rights of Priority Act
(Sw. förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)) some preferential and secured creditors have the benefit of payment before
other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights (Sw. särskild och
_allmän förmånsrätt). Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to_
payment from such property. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company’s
estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment
from such property. Claims that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of
the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as
against each other. However, a claim can also be subordinated, for example, if the creditor has entered into an
agreement stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of bankruptcy, claims in relation to the
bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the debtor) due to costs relating to the bankruptcy (including fees
payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), may have priority over claims in relation to the debtor. In general, proceeds
are distributed in the following order: (i) fees to the receiver in bankruptcy; (ii) debts of the estate (Sw. massaskuld);
(iii) specific preferential rights; (iv) general preferential rights; (v) non-prioritized debts; and (vi) subordinated debts.

**_Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee or Security Interest_**

Certain provisions of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)) may limit a guarantee or

security interest provided by a Swedish Guarantor.

According to the Swedish Companies Act, a value transfer from a Swedish limited liability company (a

“Swedish Company”) would be unlawful to the extent (i) the Swedish Company after such transfer would not have
sufficient funds to cover its debts and its restricted equity or (ii) to the extent it would not be considered prudent by
the Swedish Company to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements
imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish Company’s business or the Swedish Company’s need
to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position. Should the Swedish Company be a parent company,
the latter assessment should be made also on group level. The provision of a guarantee or security interest by a
Swedish company for a third party’s obligation would typically be deemed to constitute a value transfer to the extent
the guarantee or security interest is deemed to be made for an obligation, if the obligor in relation to such obligation
would be deemed not able to fulfil its obligation to repay the Swedish Company at the time the guarantee or security
interest is provided by the Swedish Company, and when determining the repayment capacity, the value of the shares
in the Swedish Company may not be included.

Furthermore, according to the Swedish Companies Act, a Swedish Company may not, subject to certain

exceptions, provide a guarantee or security interest for an obligation of, among other things, its shareholder or a
shareholder of another company within the same group of companies. The most important exception in this case
would be that the prohibition does not apply to any guarantee or security interest provided for an obligation of
another company within the same group (Sw. koncern) of companies where the parent company of the group is
domiciled within the EEA.

Finally, the Swedish Companies Act prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a guarantee or security

interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company or any of its parent
or fellow subsidiary companies.

All three of the above described provisions of the Swedish Companies Act may under certain conditions limit a

guarantee or security interest provided by a Swedish Guarantor, and the guarantees and security interests provided
by the Swedish Guarantor has been limited accordingly to ensure compliance with the Swedish Companies Act.

**_Limitations on the Validity of Certain Transactions_**

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject

to specific time limits) be reversed and the goods or money can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the
company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the
debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors
before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest, granting a guarantee or
security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose, or not perfected without delay
after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or has not been perfected within the statutory time
before the bankruptcy or company reorganization proceedings, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable
compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the
majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during the three months
preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer time limits apply
and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement
or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor, such as a subsidiary or parent company
and situations where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement are aware of, inter _alia, the insolvency of_
the debtor.

**_Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_**

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests to the secured parties represented by an

agent. However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or a mandate
of agency, including the appointment of an agent, can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or
mandates of agency can under Swedish law be revoked and will in addition terminate by operation of law and
without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.

**_Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Swedish Reorganization Act (Sw. lag (2022:964) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing

economic difficulty with an opportunity to resolve these difficulties without being declared bankrupt. A company
reorganization may be granted by the court if it can be presumed that the company cannot pay its due and payable
debts or that such inability will exist shortly or that the debtor, in some other respect, is having financial difficulties
which entail a risk of insolvency and there are clear grounds to assume that the viability of the company’s business
can be secured through the company reorganization. Company reorganization proceedings continue for an initial
period of three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended with three-month periods
at a time. A company reorganization may not last longer than a total of fifteen months although certain key
provisions for the benefit of the debtor, e.g., the moratorium on execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of
security and the termination of contracts entered into by the debtor, can only be extended to have effect for a total of
twelve months (as described further below).

An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and

safeguards the interests of creditors. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for
important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting security
for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in
respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. If the debtor
undertakes any of the mentioned legal acts, the legal act shall be rescinded where the administrator, within a
reasonable time after they learned or should have learned about the legal act, so requests. However, a legal act
between the debtor and a third person which is undertaken on or before the date on which the restructuring was
registered in the insolvency register shall be valid notwithstanding that it was performed without the administrator’s
consent, unless it is shown that the other party knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that company
restructuring had been ordered for the debtor.

All parties with a claim or right affected by the reorganization are included in a company reorganization and

divided into one or more classes based on similarity in ranking and other interests. The company reorganization can
include anything the parties may voluntarily agree on, including e.g. debt restructuring, change of terms, issue of
shares, change in management, debt-to-equity swaps. Limitations exist e.g. by principles of equal treatment of
creditors in the same class, meaning that it is not possible to favor a specific contract or creditor. Furthermore, the

A 55


-----

outcome for a creditor in the company reorganization may not be worse than it would have been in the event of the
debtor’s bankruptcy.

A company reorganization procedure entails a stay of enforcement measures and bankruptcy during the

procedure (subject to certain exceptions, including enforcement of certain types of security). The stay of
enforcement will last for a maximum period of twelve months, even if the company reorganization procedure
continues beyond that point. Existing security does not expire, but cannot be enforced during the period of the
company reorganization procedure (security in the possession of a creditor may be enforced, unless it is likely that
this would jeopardise the reorganization or the stay would unfairly prejudice the creditors of those claims and
subject to the approval of the administrator).

A debtor subject to a company reorganization may elect which contracts to fulfil during the company

reorganization procedure. The debtor will require the administrator’s approval to perform a contract entered into
prior to the reorganization (in part or in full), unless the contract is in the course of day-to-day management of the
business. The debtor may, with the consent of the administrator, terminate long-term contracts with three-month
notice period. Counterparties are generally prohibited from terminating contracts, including credit agreements and
financing agreements. Creditors may only terminate contracts entered into prior to the reorganization if the debtor
does not perform the contracts or after confirmation from the debtor (and the administrator) that the contract will not
be performed. The debtor shall compensate for loss incurred by the contracting party as a consequence of the
termination. The contracting party’s claim for damages shall be deemed to have arisen prior to the order regarding
company restructuring and may therefore be subject to write-off.

Following a decision to initiate a company reorganization, the debtor may request that the court schedule a

negotiation regarding a reorganization plan (plan negotiation). In the proposed reorganization plan, the affected
parties shall be divided into one or more classes based on similarity in ranking and other interests, and parties within
the same class must be treated equally. The affected parties (i.e. the parties whose claims are affected by the
proposed reorganization plan) shall vote to adopt the proposed reorganization plan. If the plan is adopted, the court
will consider whether there are grounds to confirm it. A reorganization plan is considered adopted by the affected
parties if, for each class of creditors, not less than two-thirds of the parties voting have approved the plan, and the
claims or rights of such approving parties constitute not less than two-thirds of the claims or rights for which voting
rights may be exercised. A reorganization plan that has not been adopted in accordance with the foregoing may upon
request by the debtor or the administrator be confirmed by a court by way of cross-group cram-down subject to
certain conditions, including: that the reorganization plan has been approved by more than one-half of the classes
and at least one of these is comprised of creditors who have a right of priority, a security interest, or a right of setoff, or at least two of these classes are creditors who can be expected to receive payment in the debtor’s bankruptcy;
and classes that voted against the reorganization plan receive at least as beneficial treatment under the reorganization
plan as that of other classes which have the same priority in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy, and receive full
satisfaction for their claims if any lower priority group receive payment or retains rights under the reorganization
plan. Further, no group of affected parties may keep more than the full value of their claims or rights. A
reorganization plan that has been confirmed by the court is binding on the company, all affected parties and potential
counterparties in agreements concerning new financing. This means that various actions, including write-down of
debt, could be forced upon individual creditors as well as classes of creditors.

**_Enforcement_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. konkurslag (1987:627)), if a Swedish company is unable to

rightfully pay its debts as they fall due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be
declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the competent district court (Sw. tingsrätt) by the
debtor or by a creditor of the debtor.

In the event of bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs), the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw.

_konkursförvaltare) who will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtors assets and_
distribute the proceeds among the creditors. The bankruptcy estate (Sw. konkursbo) is deemed to constitute a
separate legal entity.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors

receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the
assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In

A 56


-----

general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the
proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s
directors or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s
assets.

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of

Priority Act, as amended, which states the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in
bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed
from the debtor’s assets. However, preferential or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other
creditors.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in

bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts. A
clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of bankruptcy proceedings or similar is
likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right to fulfil the company’s obligations
according to a contract). If the bankruptcy estate steps into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the
creditor may demand that the bankruptcy estate performs its newly assumed obligations as well or, if a grace period
has been granted, request that the bankruptcy estate, without unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its
performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may request security where this is necessary in
order to protect it against loss. If the bankruptcy estate does not step into the contract within a reasonable time after
the creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the creditor’s request to provide security, the creditor may
terminate the contract.

In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an

enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Sw. Kronofogdemyndigheten) or the court. Upon
obtaining an enforcement order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for
enforcement of its claim. If agreed upon between a pledgor and a secured creditor and the secured creditor or its
agent is in physical possession of the security assets, the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge
without the involvement of the Swedish Enforcement Authority or a court. A provision granting the secured party or
its agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the
secured party or its agent but it should be noted that the secured party or its agent has, in case of such a right of
enforcement, extensive obligations to observe the pledgor’s interest when enforcing the pledge, such as an
obligation to account for the proceeds of the sale.

**_Creation of Valid Security Interests_**

In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the asset subject to such security interest must

generally fulfil the following criteria: (a) there must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in respect of the
obligations which the security purports to secure; (b) the security provider must grant the security interest, typically
in the form of a pledge agreement; (c) the security assets must be sufficiently specified; and (d) an act perfecting the
security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.

Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured

party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to
control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be
created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of a specific
trigger event (e.g. an enforcement event) would therefore not be effective until such trigger event has occurred and
the guarantor being effectively deprived of its right to deal or dispose over the relevant asset (thereby resulting in the
security interests having been perfected at such time). Security interests that are subject to such delayed perfection
stand the risk of being subject to a hardening period and clawback claims whereby the security interest might be
held invalid and unenforceable.

Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured

assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with the disposal
thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security.

A 57


-----

In the case of a pledge over shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the share certificates

to the possession of the pledgee. In addition, if the share certificates are situated outside Sweden, perfection of the
pledge may require that all necessary perfection requirements under the applicable laws in such jurisdictions are also
complied with.

The right to future shares and dividends can be pledged. As set out above, any security purported to be created

over, inter alia, (i) future shares before such shares are issued and/or (ii) dividends after a certain triggering event,
will not be perfected from the outset and may as such be vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of
being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider.

**_Trust_**

Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions for trusts to be formed and trustees to be appointed.

While Swedish law does not know the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a trustee that has been appointed
under foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed under the laws governing such appointment,
will be recognized and acknowledged in Sweden and that such an appointed trustee may be able to claim and
enforce or procure the enforcement of the rights of the beneficiaries under the trust, subject to the terms of the
relevant documents.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The principal rule is that foreign judgments are neither recognized nor enforced in Sweden, unless explicitly

permitted by law, including where such judgments pertain to a civil or commercial matter (but not for example,
certain bankruptcy related matters) rendered by a court of a state to which Sweden is bound by a convention or
treaty allowing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, e.g. another EU Member State or member state of
the Economic Free Trade Association (“EFTA”), or judgments rendered by a court of another Nordic country.

The United States and Sweden do not currently have a convention or treaty providing for the reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial matters.
Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States in civil
and commercial matters, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not be
directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated de novo by way of

civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative
tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by a federal or
state court in the U.S. may be regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the
relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio.

Pursuant to the provisions of the 2012 Brussels Regulation, a final and conclusive judgment rendered against a

company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all EU Member States) and which is enforceable
in such a Member State, will be recognized and enforceable in proceedings taken in Sweden upon the satisfaction of
the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels Regulation. It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for
refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation.
Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden.

With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and

Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a final and conclusive judgment rendered against a company in
the courts of a Contracting Party (as defined in therein, i.e., all EU Member States and member states of the EFTA
other than Liechtenstein (namely Iceland, Switzerland and Norway)) and which is enforceable in such Contracting
Party, will be recognized and enforceable in proceedings taken in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under
the Lugano Convention.

With regard to the provisions of the Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the

“Hague Convention”), a final and conclusive judgment rendered against a company in the courts of a Contracting
State (as defined therein) and which is enforceable in such Contracting State, will be recognized and enforceable in
proceedings taken in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under the Hague Convention.

Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a member state under any

applicable convention or treaty (such as the terms of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or a contracting state under the
terms of the Lugano Convention), including without limitation judgments made in the United States of America and
non-EU/EFTA countries, would generally not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law, and would
not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden without a retrial on the merits.

Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the

judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a
foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the
judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign
currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the
parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish
kronor.

Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement

authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability the translation into
Swedish of any relevant document, and assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection
with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations.

It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a

mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore
any powers of attorney or mandates of agency issued by a Swedish party can be revoked and will terminate by
operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish party giving such powers.

**_Taxation_**

The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences relating to holders of the notes. The

summary is based on the laws of Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only.
The summary does not address, inter alia, situations where notes are held in an investment savings account
(investeringssparkonto) or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers of interest. Further, the
summary does not address credit of foreign taxes. Investors should consult their professional tax advisors regarding
the Swedish tax and other tax consequences (including the applicability and effect of tax treaties) of notes in their
particular circumstances.

**_Holders Not Tax Resident in Sweden_**

Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to

the holder of any notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder (i) is not resident in
Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and (ii) does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the notes are
effectively connected.

**_Holders Tax Resident in Sweden_**

In general, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with residence

in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (for example, income that is considered to be interest for
Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences may be applicable to
certain categories of corporations, for example, life insurance companies. Moreover, specific tax consequences may
be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of notes realizes a capital loss on the notes and to any currency
exchange gains or losses.

If amounts that are deemed as interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in Sweden,

including a Swedish branch, or a clearing institution within the EEA, to a private individual (or an estate of a
deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally
withheld by the legal entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other
returns on notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to
above.

**Switzerland**

Amer Sports European Center AG is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland and is a guarantor of the notes.

Any insolvency proceedings applicable to a security provider or guarantor incorporated under the laws of

Switzerland (a “Swiss Guarantor”) are governed by Swiss law and set out below under “Insolvency”. Swiss law on
hardening periods and fraudulent transfers may need to be considered as well, a summary of which is set out under
“Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfers” below.

Limitations on the validity and enforceability of a guarantee and the security interests provided by a Swiss

Guarantor may apply to enforcements of judgments in general (as set out below under “Enforcement of Judgments”)
and/or due to limitations on the enforcement of upstream or cross-steam guarantees or security interests, provided
that such limitations shall not release the respective Swiss Guarantor from payment obligations generally, but
merely postpone the payment date of those obligations until such time as payment of such obligations is again
permitted notwithstanding such limitations. The payment under the respective Swiss Guarantor’s guarantee or other
security may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed including, but not limited to, obtaining an
audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. The enforcement of the respective Swiss Guarantor’s
guarantee or other security granted by such Swiss Guarantor may give rise to tax levied pursuant to the Swiss
Federal Act on Withholding Tax (Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13. Oktober 1965) as amended
from time to time together with the related ordinances, regulations and guidelines on dividends to the extent that the
payment or enforcement of such guarantee or other security, respectively, may be regarded as a deemed distribution
by the respective Swiss Guarantor to the Company or any other related party. For these reasons, it is standard market
practice for indenture agreements, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called
“limitation language” in relation to the respective Swiss Guarantor substantially in the form as set out below under
“Limitations on Enforcement of a Guarantee or a Security Interest Granted by Swiss Guarantors.”

**_Insolvency_**

Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the

assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity
has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no
pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be
dealt with separately.

In the event of a Swiss Guarantor’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would be governed by

Swiss law as a result of such Swiss Guarantor’s offices being registered in the competent commercial register in
Switzerland. In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement
of security interests over assets located in Switzerland. The enforcement of claims and questions relating to
insolvency and bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy
(Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs vom 11. April 1889, the “DEBA”), as amended from time to
time. The rules under the DEBA may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration
of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the notes
to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under these rules claims that are pursued
against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of bankruptcy proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general
liquidation of all assets and liabilities of the Swiss debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by
a pledge (including mortgages) must follow a special enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the
collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed on a private liquidation. However, if
bankruptcy is declared while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the
creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer
permitted.

The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force.

As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt enforcement

procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons by local debt enforcement authorities
(Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior proceedings
if the following requirements are met: (1) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors or the

A 60


-----

auditors of the company (in case of failure of the board of directors) declare that the debtor is over-indebted
(überschuldet) within the meaning of article 725b para. 3 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or if it declares to be
insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), or (2) at the request of a creditor, if the debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of
its creditors or ceases to make payments (Zahlungseinstellung) or if certain events happen during composition
proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in
bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung).

All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently form the

bankrupt estate, which after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, are used to satisfy the creditors. Assets of
the bankrupt estate over which a pledge (or mortgage) was created in favor of a creditor before the declaration of
bankruptcy are included in the bankrupt estate. The pledgee or any security agent, as the case may be, is under an
obligation to remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate. The assets are liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy
in the same manner as the other assets of the bankrupt estate, but the creditor secured by the pledge retains its
privilege to be satisfied from the proceeds of the liquidation of the assets pledged to it with priority over the
unsecured creditors. Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The
first and the second class, which are privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident insurance,
pension plans, employee social plans and family law. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the government and
its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class.
A secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral. Also, it should be
noted that a contractual postponement and subordination of claims against a Swiss debtor, a contractual restriction of
enforcement actions against a Swiss debtor or an appointment by a Swiss debtor of a third party to act as its attorney
or receiver would be valid as between the parties thereto, but may not be binding on an insolvency official after the
occurrence of an insolvency event.

Claims assigned for security purposes by a Swiss Guarantor that come into existence prior to the opening of

bankruptcy can be enforced by the assignee outside Swiss bankruptcy proceedings. Assigned claims that come into
existence after the opening of bankruptcy over a Swiss Guarantor may fall within the bankrupt estate and the
assignee may not be entitled to such claim proceeds.

Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors.

Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a temporary moratorium (provisorische
_Nachlassstundung) of a maximum duration of four months. During the moratorium, the debtor can seek to_
restructure and, if successful, ask the court to lift the moratorium without entering into a composition agreement.
The moratorium can also result in a composition agreement which takes the form of (1) either an ordinary
composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag) where the debtor’s business continues and the contractual
terms of its payment obligations are modified (Stundungsvergleich) or creditors receive a dividend
(Dividendenvergleich) or (2) a composition agreement providing for the assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit
_Vermögensabtretung) where the debtor’s assets are assigned to creditors in order to sell the debtor’s assets (or part_
of it) or to liquidate such assets. The moratorium could also result in a composition agreement that may comprise the
formation of a new company (Auffanggesellschaft) to receive part of the business of the debtor. During a
moratorium, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. Furthermore, debt
collection proceedings can in principle not be initiated and pending debt collection proceedings are stayed. Special
enforcement proceedings to liquidate collateral cannot in principle be initiated or continued (although a secured
creditor may have to take, during the moratorium, certain actions to safeguard its rights in connection with any
special enforcement proceeding instigated before the moratorium). In case of a pledge, the secured party is not
entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. In
principle, interest ceases to accrue against the debtor for all unsecured claims. With the consent of the
commissionaire, the debtor has the right to terminate long-term contracts at any time if without such termination the
restructuring cannot be achieved. The moratorium does however not per se affect the agreed due dates of debts
(contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). Any composition
agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial
confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject
to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfers_**

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration may, under certain conditions, avoid transactions,

such as, inter alia, the granting of or the payment under any guarantee or security or, if a payment has already been

A 61


-----

made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipients return the amount received to the debtor’s
estate. In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the
payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in
the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors:

(i) The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any
consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which
the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided.
In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without
limitation a group company, the burden of proof is reversed: the beneficiary must in this case prove that
such transaction was at arm’s length.

(ii) Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal

insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already
over-indebted at that time: (x) granting of security for existing claims, provided that the debtor was not
previously obliged to grant such security, (y) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other
way than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (z) the payment of a
debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary of the transaction can
prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the
debtor had been over-indebted at that time.

(iii) Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal

insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the
intention to disadvantage some creditors over others or to favor some creditors over others are voidable if
such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence, must have been known to the debtor’s
counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including
without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is reversed: the beneficiary must in this case
prove that such intention was not recognizable.

If any guarantee or security interest is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason,

the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of that guarantee or security and would have a claim solely
under the notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been
avoided would have to be repaid.

**_Enforcement of Judgments_**

We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in

Switzerland, or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court.
Enforcement in Switzerland of judgments rendered outside Switzerland would be subject to the limitations set forth
in (1) the Lugano Convention of October 30, 2007 on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters, (2) such other (multilateral or bilateral) international treaties under which Switzerland is bound,
and (3) the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (Bundesgesetz über das Internationale Privatrecht (the
“PILA”); namely art. 25 et seq. of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law).

The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and

enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state
court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the proceeding set forth by the PILA and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische
_Zivilprozessordnung) and/or the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz über_
_Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the_
original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would

A 62


-----

be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in Articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act
on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which include:

  - the Swiss court determines that the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings;

  - the judgment is final under U.S. federal or state law, and no ordinary legal remedy being available against
such judgment;

  - the recognition of the foreign judgment (i.e. the enforcement of such foreign judgment) is not manifestly
incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer ordre public);

  - the parties have been properly served with process according to the law of the state of his/her/its domicile
or ordinary residence (if in Switzerland, through judicial aid granted by the Swiss authorities) or the
counterparty has unconditionally joined the proceedings;

  - the proceedings leading to the judgment have respected the principles of a fair trial (as understood in
Switzerland) and, in particular, that the counterparty has been granted the right to be heard and the
possibility to properly defend his/her/its case; and

  - the matter (Rechtsstreit) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter
(Rechtsstreit) which was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entering its proceedings, or
the matter (Rechtsstreit) resulting in the judgement of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter
(Rechtsstreit) previously decided by a Swiss court or by a court in another jurisdiction, provided that such
non-Swiss decision is enforceable in Switzerland.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the notes may be able to enforce in Switzerland judgments in civil and

commercial matters obtained from New York courts. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to enforce
judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize
U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings
in the sense of art. 6 (PILA). Furthermore, it is doubtful whether a Swiss court would enforce a judgment of any
U.S. court predicated solely upon the federal or state securities laws of the United States.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts as

incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the
amount of damages ordered by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to
compensate actual losses or damages.

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the

production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial,
compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained
in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery
process exists. Instead, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties
and the related burden of proof.

Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad on a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s

reservation to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and
Commercial Matters concluded on November 15, 1965) and service must be effective by way of judicial assistance.

Enforcement claims or court judgments against a Swiss entity under Swiss debt collection or bankruptcy

proceedings may be made only in Swiss francs and any foreign currency amounts must accordingly be converted
into Swiss francs. With respect to enforcing creditors, any such foreign currency amounts will be converted at the
exchange rate prevailing in particular on (i) the date of instituting the enforcement proceedings
(Betreibungsverfahren) and (ii) upon creditor’s request, the date of the filing for the continuation of the enforcement
procedure (Fortsetzungsbegehren). With respect to non-enforcing creditors, foreign currency amounts will be
converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy (Konkurseröffnung).

A 63

**_Limitations on Enforcement of a Guarantee or a Security Interest Granted by Swiss Guarantors_**

The granting of guarantees or security by the Swiss guarantor as well as any other undertaking contained in any

agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights
or the subordination of intra-group claims, granted by the Swiss guarantor for the benefit of its direct and indirect
parent and sister companies are subject to certain restrictions on the distribution of corporate assets under Swiss
corporate law. Therefore, in order to enable the Swiss guarantor to grant guarantees and security interests securing
liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such restrictions and to protect management from personal
liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain socalled “limitation language” (see below) in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a
Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft). as is the Swiss guarantor, or a Swiss limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of the guarantee and
security interests granted by the Swiss guarantor will be limited reflecting the requirement that payments under the
guarantee or, as the case may be, the use of proceeds from the enforcement of security interests may not cause the
Swiss guarantor to incur a liability which would exceed its freely distributable equity at the time of the enforcement
of the guarantee or, as the case may be, any security interest. The freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum
amount which the Swiss guarantor can distribute to its shareholders or shareholders, respectively, as a dividend
payment under Swiss law at that point in time. These limitations apply in relation to guarantees or security interests
securing the performance of any obligations of any (direct or indirect) shareholder and/or any sister company of the
Swiss guarantor.

Generally, any guarantee or security governed by Swiss law is enforced in accordance with its terms under

Swiss law. Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of Article 111 of the Swiss Code of
Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative. Other security
(rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement. Typically, the security
agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties to enforce the security
either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or
(ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency, in which
case the right of objection pursuant to Article 41 of the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency
(Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. In such case, the
parties also typically agree in advance that a private sale (Freihandverkauf) will be admissible.

In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any

or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In such a case, in order to determine the price for the acquisition of the
pledged assets, the security agent may either sell the pledged assets or liquidate the company whose shares have
been pledged and sell its assets in such a manner as it sees fit. Thereafter, the security agent will settle the
acquisition of the pledged assets with the pledgor. For this purpose, the gross proceeds of any sale of the pledged
assets or of the liquidation of the company whose shares have been pledged will, after payment of expenses and
taxes and – in case of a liquidation – any third-party debts, be considered the price for the acquisition of the pledged
assets, which is applied to the secured obligations. The security agent will credit any remaining surplus to the
pledgor.

In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured

parties, collect all assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by
way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without
having to initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency.

After insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are

considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency administration.
Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to
certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims
of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors.

The notes indenture provides for the following Swiss limitation language: If and to the extent that obligations of

a Swiss Guarantor under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation, are for the benefit of its direct or
indirect affiliates (other than its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) and that complying with such
obligations would constitute a repayment of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected
reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such

A 64


-----

Swiss Guarantor or would otherwise be restricted under Swiss corporate law then applicable (the “Restricted
Obligations”), the following provisions shall apply:

The aggregate liability of a Swiss Guarantor for Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any other

notes documentation, including, without limitation, under the guarantee, shall be limited to the extent and in the
maximum amount of its freely disposable equity (frei verfügbares Eigenkapital) at the point in time such Swiss
Guarantor’s obligations fall due (including, without limitation, any statutory reserves which can be transferred into
unrestricted, distributable reserves) (the “Available Amount”), provided that this is a requirement under applicable
law and practice at that time and further provided that such limitation (as may apply from time to time or not) shall
not (generally or definitively) release such Swiss Guarantor from performing Restricted Obligations hereunder in
excess thereof, but merely postpone the performance date therefor until such times as performance is again
permitted notwithstanding such limitation.

If the enforcement of the obligations of the Swiss Guarantor under the notes indenture or an applicable

guarantee would be limited due to the effects set out hereunder, the Swiss Guarantor shall further, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and Swiss accounting standards and upon request by the Trustee, (i) write up or sell any
of its assets that are shown in its balance sheet with a book value that is significantly lower than the market value of
the assets, in case of sale, however, only if such assets are not necessary for the Swiss Guarantor’s business (nicht
_betriebsnotwendig) and (ii) reduce its share capital to the minimum allowed under then applicable law, provided that_
such steps are permitted under the notes indenture.

Immediately after having been requested to perform Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any

other notes documentation, a Swiss Guarantor shall and any parent company of such Swiss Guarantor shall procure
that such Swiss Guarantor will:

(i) if and to the extent requested by the Trustee or required under then applicable Swiss law, provide the
Trustee, within 30 business days, with (a) an interim up-to-date balance sheet audited by its statutory
auditors, (b) the determination by the statutory auditors of the Available Amount based on such interim
audited balance sheet and (c) a confirmation from the statutory auditors of such Swiss Guarantor that the
Available Amount complies with the provisions of Swiss corporate law which are aimed at protecting the
share capital and legal reserves;

(ii) take such further corporate and other action which may be necessary at the time (such as board and

shareholder approvals and the receipt of any confirmations from its statutory auditors) in order to allow a
prompt payment under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation with a minimum of
limitations; and/or

(iii) immediately after confirming the Available Amount in accordance with sub-paragraph (i) above, procure

that any amounts received or collected by the Trustee under and in connection with Restricted Obligations
under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation in excess of the Available Amount shall be
retransferred to it as soon as possible and, if not already done so, be paid up to the Available Amount (less,
if required, any Swiss withholding tax) to the Trustee.

Payments by Swiss Guarantors may be reduced due to the obligation to deduct the Swiss withholding tax on

dividends (currently at the rate of 35% subject to applicable double taxation treaties), to the extent that the payment
is regarded as a distribution of dividends to the Company or any other related party. The Swiss withholding tax on
dividends must be deducted from the gross payment unless a notification procedure applies.

If required under applicable law (including double tax treaties) in force at the time it is required to perform

Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation, a Swiss Guarantor and the
Company shall:

(iv) use their best efforts to ensure that any payments under the notes indenture or any other notes

documentation can be made without deduction of Swiss withholding tax on dividends or with deduction of
Swiss withholding tax on dividends at a reduced rate, by discharging the liability to such tax by
notification pursuant to applicable law (including tax treaties) rather than payment of the tax;

(v) if and to the extent required by applicable law in force at the relevant time (including double taxation

treaties), a Swiss Guarantor shall:

A 65


-----

A. deduct the Swiss withholding tax on dividends at the rate of 35% (or such other rate as is in force at

that time) from any payment under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation;

B. pay the Swiss withholding tax on dividends to the tax authorities referred to in Article 34 of the

Swiss Federal Law on Withholding Tax (Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13.
_Oktober 1965) (the “Swiss Federal Tax Administration”); and_

C. notify and provide evidence to the Trustee that the Swiss withholding tax on dividends has been paid

to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.

A Swiss Guarantor and the Company shall use their best efforts to ensure that any person which is, as a result of

a deduction of Swiss withholding tax on dividends, entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss withholding tax on
dividends, will, as soon as possible after the deduction of the Swiss withholding tax on dividends, (1) request a
refund of the Swiss withholding tax on dividends under any applicable law (including double tax treaties) and (2)
pay to the Trustee upon receipt any amount so refunded.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS**

**1.** **THE COMPANY**

**Background and description of the business**

Amer Sports, Inc. (formerly Amer Sports Management Holding (Cayman) Limited) (the “Company”)
was founded on January 3, 2020 and is incorporated and domiciled in Grand Cayman, the Cayman Islands.
The Company’s registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, PO Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111,
Cayman Islands. Hereinafter, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to as the “Group”or
“Amer Sports”. The ultimate parent company of the Group is Amer Sports Holding (Cayman) Limited
(the “parent company”).

Amer Sports is a global platform of sport and outdoor brands, including Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson,
Atomic and Peak Performance. Amer Sports manufactures, markets and sells sports equipment, apparel,
and footwear through wholesale and direct to consumer channels globally and has a sales network of
34 countries, with North America, Europe, Asia and China being the main market areas.

**Seasonality**

Although the Group operates in a number of sporting goods segments during all four seasons, its
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the fourth quarter of a financial year has been the
strongest quarter for the Group in terms of both net sales and profitability, primarily due to higher sales
through the Company’s DTC channel compared to the rest of the year and a higher share of fall and
winter collections in the Group’s Technical Apparel and Outdoor Performance segments. The Ball & Racquet
Sports segment is generally more consistent across fiscal quarters. Working capital requirements typically
increase throughout the second and third fiscal quarters as inventory builds to support the Group’s peak
shipping and selling period which typically occurs from August to December. Cash provided by operating
activities is typically highest in the first fiscal quarter due to the significant inflows associated with the
peak selling season.

**2.** **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Basis of preparation**

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standard (“IAS”) 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”) as at January 1, 2023.

The interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial
report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial
year and corresponding interim reporting period.

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in millions of
U.S. dollars (USD). The presented figures and percentages are subject to rounding adjustments, which may
cause discrepancies between the sum of the individual figures and the presented aggregated column and
row totals. The figures have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of
financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period
as well as derivative financial instruments at fair value. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of the business.

Despite incurring operational losses, the Company maintains ongoing liquidity through a
USD 336 million (EUR 315 million) revolving credit facility. This facility is designed to support the
Company’s short-term liquidity requirements. Additionally, the Company has established several cash


-----

pooling structures with the Group’s relationship banks as well as a factoring agreement with a banking
institution that can be utilized in order to manage the liquidity of the Group.

The Interim Financial Statements were authorized for issuance in accordance with a resolution of the
Company’s Board of Directors on November 17, 2023.

**Recent changes in accounting pronouncements**

No new IFRS or amendments to existing IFRS and interpretations issued and effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 have had or are expected to have a material impact for the
Group. The management’s assessment of the impact of new standards, which are not yet effective and which
have not been early adopted by the Group, on the consolidated interim financial statements is on-going,
but is not expected to have a material impact for the Group.

**Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions**

When preparing the unaudited condensed interim financial statements, the Group’s management
makes judgments and estimates influencing the content of the unaudited condensed interim financial
statements and it must exercise its judgment regarding the application of accounting policies. Management
continuously evaluates the judgments and estimates it uses.

The significant judgments made and the estimates used by management have been applied in the same
manner as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021.

**Changes in accounting principles**

The Company made certain reclassifications and introduced the category “Other reserves” to the
consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit) for all periods presented to improve
readability and comparability to peers.

**3.** **SEGMENT REPORTING**

The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) reviews results of operations to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. Based on the current reporting structures,
decision-making processes and considering the aggregation criteria in IFRS 8.12, the Company identified
three reportable segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance as well as Ball & Racquet Sports.

The Company measures each segment’s performance based on revenue and adjusted operating profit as
these are the measures used by the CODM for assessing the performance.

**CONTRACT BALANCES**

Contract liabilities amounted to USD 15.6 million as of September 30, 2023 (as of December 31, 2022:
USD 20.8 million) and primarily relate to advance payments received as well as accrued discounts and rebates.
The Company expects that these contract liabilities will result in revenue within one year.

**5.** **PENSIONS**

Pension arrangements at September 30, 2023 have been reviewed in respect of the latest discount rates,
inflation rates and asset valuations. A remeasurement loss of USD 1.8 million and USD 6.2 million (2022:
loss of USD 3.0 million and gain of USD 6.0 million) has been recognized in the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The remeasurement loss recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted
of a decrease in the obligations of USD 8.3 million and USD 5.9 million (2022: decrease of USD 14.6 million
and USD 67.7 million), that was partly offset by an increase in asset valuations of USD 8.1 million and
USD 2.5 million (2022: increase of USD 9.7 million and decrease of USD 48.1 million), respectively.

**6.** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**

**Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2019 and Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2023**

The Board approved the Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2023 (“2023 ESOP”) in January 2023. The
objectives of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2019 (“2019 ESOP”) and 2023 ESOP are to align the
interest of the shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the Company in the long-term,
and to commit key employees to the Company. The 2019 ESOP and 2023 ESOP provide for awards in the
form of stock options to the Group’s key employees, and it is an equity-settled arrangement, except for stock
options granted to certain employees which allow them to elect for shares or cash settlement.

The maximum number of options under the 2019 ESOP and 2023 ESOP that may be granted is 3%
and 1.2% respectively of all of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares.

Subject to a participant’s continued employment, options granted under the 2019 ESOP and 2023
ESOP will vest upon satisfaction of vesting conditions set out in an award agreement and an exit event (a
public offering of the shares of the Company or a sale of a controlling majority of the shares in the Company
or Amer Sports Corporation or any of its holding companies or the sale of the majority of the business
assets of the Group) (the “exit event”).

In addition to an exit event, 35% of the options granted are time-vested, which vest evenly on an
annual basis over a 5-year period and 3-year period for 2019 ESOP and 2023 ESOP respectively, 65% of the
options granted are with Group and/or brand performances.

The vesting of the options is subject to an exit event, which is a non-market performance condition.
No share-based payment cost for equity-settled awards and cash-settled awards has been recognized during


-----

the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 since the occurrence of such event was not deemed
probable during any of the reporting periods.

The options outstanding at September 30, 2023 had an exercise price of EUR 32.20 and a remaining
contractual life of 6.25 years.

No options were exercised during the reporting periods.

Included in the above options are cash-settled awards granted to certain employees. On April 6, 2023,
the Group granted 19,588 options to an employee who can elect shares or cash settlement. The exercise
price of these options granted was EUR 32.20. Vested options are exercisable until December 31, 2029. The
payoff of cash settlement, where applicable, is determined based on the share price of the Company at the
time of exercise less the exercise price and relevant taxes.

_Fair value of options granted_

The fair value of the options has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Service and nonmarket performance conditions attached to the options were not taken into account in measuring fair value.
Market performance condition was taken into account in measuring fair value. Equity-settled awards are

**8.** **INCOME TAXES**

In accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, income tax expense for the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements is calculated on the basis of the average annual tax rate that is
expected for the entire fiscal year, adjusted for the tax effect of certain items recognized in the full interim
period. As such, the effective tax rate in the consolidated interim financial statements may differ from
management’s best estimate of the effective rate.

The effective tax rate was -988% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 111% for the
three months ended September 30, 2022. The change in effective tax rate from the three months ended
September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 results from an increase of nondeductible interest expenses.

The effective tax rate was -130% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and -43% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022. The change in effective tax rate from the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 results from an increase of nondeductible interest expenses.

**9.** **INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no significant additions, disposals or
impairments.

**Impairment review**

Impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as trademarks, are
performed when the management has identified indications of impairment or once a year when business
plans for the next strategic planning horizon are approved by the management.

Goodwill is monitored by management at Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) level, the level at which it
and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment. The CGUs in the Group are the
following: Winter Sports Equipment, Salomon Apparel and Footwear, Arc’teryx, Ball & Racquet Sports and
Peak Performance.

In July 2023, the Company made a change in its CGUs to align with the way it now manages its
business, and accounted for such change in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . The Salomon
equipment operations, previously part of the CGU Winter Sports Equipment, were transferred to the CGU
Salomon Apparel and Footwear and the CGU was renamed to Salomon in the course of the restructuring.
The Group was required, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, to allocate assets and liabilities,
including goodwill, between the two CGUs. Goodwill was reallocated based on relative fair value in
accordance with IAS 36.87. Goodwill and trademarks transferred from the CGU Winter Sports Equipment
to the CGU Salomon amounted to USD 74.2 million and USD 146.3 million as of July 1, 2023, respectively.

The carrying amounts of goodwill and trademarks of the affected CGUs are as follows:

**Goodwill** **Trademarks**

**September 30,** **December 31,** **September 30,** **December 31,**
**USD million** **2023** **2022** **2023** **2022**

Winter Sports Equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 75.8 149.0 127.0 270.9

Salomon (previously Salomon Apparel and
Footwear) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 651.7 583.4 616.7 477.8

The Company performed an impairment review prior to the restructuring, which did not indicate any preexisting impairment requirement. In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an internal restructuring
of assets among CGUs only qualifies as an impairment indicator if the restructuring had an adverse effect
on the Company. The Company’s assessment did not reveal any adverse effects triggered by the restructuring
and thus the event was not considered an impairment indicator.

Carrying amounts of current financial instruments carried at amortized cost are reasonable
approximation of fair value due to their short-term nature. Carrying amounts of loans from financial
institutions, loans from related parties, and other interest-bearing liabilities approximate their fair values
because the loans are at floating rate.

Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market
prices at the end of the reporting period. The Group does not have any financial instrument included in
level 1.

Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. over-thecounter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market
data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an
instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities.

Carrying amounts of current financial instruments carried at amortized cost are reasonable
approximation of fair value due to their short-term nature.

The Group’s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of
the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements
during the reporting period.

The valuation process and valuation techniques, which are stated in the most recent consolidated
annual financial statements, are applicable in the reporting period.


-----

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

   - for interest rate swaps—the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable
yield curves

   - for foreign currency forwards—the present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange
rates at the consolidated statement of financial position, and

   - for other financial instruments—discounted cash flow analysis.

All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2, except for unlisted equity securities,
promissory notes and available for sale factoring receivables, where the fair values have been determined
based on present values and the discount rates used were adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk. In cases
where credit risk of counterparty is low and maturity is short-term, the carrying amount of such instrument
approximates its fair value.

The following table shows the valuation technique used in measuring level 3 fair values for financial
instruments in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position, as well as the
significant unobservable inputs used.

**Type** **Valuation technique** **Significant unobservable input**


Unlisted equity securities Market comparison approach:
fair value of unlisted equity
securities is determined by
reference to market multiples of
comparable listed companies,
adjusted by discount for lack of
marketability.

Promissory notes The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these
instruments and low credit risk of
counterparty.

Available for sale factoring The carrying amount
receivables approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these
instruments and low credit risk of
counterparty.


(i) Sales growth factor

(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate

The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these

**18.** **DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE**

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company neither accounted for any
discontinued operations nor reported assets or liabilities held-for-sale as of September 30, 2023.

During June 2021, the Company entered into a term sheet with Dongguan Liesheng Electronic
Technology Co. Ltd (“Liesheng”), a leading Chinese technology company focusing on the smart & sport
wearables electronics segment, in regards to the disposal of Suunto. The assets and liabilities of the disposal
group were classified as held-for-sale and it was concluded that the disposal group qualifies as a discontinued
operation. On December 28, 2021, an agreement was reached with Liesheng to acquire the Suunto business
subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The closing of the transaction was completed on May 6, 2022. The consolidated cash and debt-free
sales value amounted to USD 18.3 million (net of transaction costs). The loss on disposal upon the sale of
the Suunto business amounted to USD 5.5 million and was reported under loss from discontinued operations,
net of tax.

Upon classifying Suunto as held-for-sale in 2021, an impairment loss in the amount of USD 77.5 million
was recognized in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

For further information about the discontinued operation, please refer to note 29 in the Group’s annual
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Amer Sports, Inc.:

**Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Amer Sports, Inc.
and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and January 1, 2021, the related consolidated
statements of loss and other comprehensive income and loss, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’
equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes
(collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, 2021,
and January 1, 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

**Correction of Misstatements**

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2022, 2021, and 2020 consolidated
financial statements have been restated to correct certain misstatements.

**Basis for Opinion**

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Critical Audit Matter**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

**Valuation of goodwill and trademarks for the Peak Performance and Winter Sports Equipment cash**
**generating units**

As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s cash generating units
(CGUs) are tested for impairment when management has identified indications of impairment or at least once
a year. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income
and loss when the carrying amount of the CGU is greater than the recoverable amount. The recoverable


-----

amounts of all CGUs were determined by the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use
(VIU). VIU has been calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each CGU. The Group recorded
goodwill and trademarks of USD 149.0 million and USD 270.9 million, respectively, for the Winter Sports
Equipment CGU as of December 31, 2022. The Group recorded trademarks of USD 151.6 million for the
Peak Performance CGU as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group
recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of USD 179.0 million and on trademarks of USD 19.1 million for
the Peak Performance CGU.

We identified the evaluation of the impairment assessment of goodwill and trademarks of the Peak
Performance and Winter Sports Equipment CGUs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective
auditor judgement was required to evaluate management’s significant assumptions included in the projected
discounted cash flows used in the determination of the recoverable amount of the CGUs, specifically the
revenue growth rate and discount rate assumptions. Additionally, the audit effort associated with this estimate
required specialized skills and knowledge.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We
performed a sensitivity analysis over the revenue growth rate and discount rate assumptions to assess the
impact that changes to these assumptions would have had on the recoverable amount of the Winter Sports
Equipment and Performance Peak CGUs. We compared the Group’s historical revenue forecasts for such
CGUs to actual results to assess management’s ability to accurately forecast. We involved valuation
professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:

   - evaluating the discount rate assumptions by testing the source information underlying management’s
determination of the discount rates and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing
those to the discount rates selected by management.

   - evaluating market transactions and comparable company revenue growth rates to develop a range of
independent market participants’ growth rates and comparing to those selected by management.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **The Company**

**Background and description of the business**

Amer Sports, Inc. (formerly Amer Sports Management Holding (Cayman) Limited) (the “Company”)
was founded on January 3, 2020 and is incorporated and domiciled in Grand Cayman, the Cayman Islands.
The Company’s registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, PO Box 2681, Grand Cayman
KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. Hereinafter, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to as
the “Group”or “Amer Sports”. The ultimate parent company of the Group is Amer Sports Holding (Cayman)
Limited (the “parent company”).

Amer Sports is a global platform of sport and outdoor brands, including Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson,
Atomic and Peak Performance. Amer Sports manufactures, markets and sells sports equipment, apparel,
and footwear through wholesale and direct to consumer channels globally and has a sales network in
34 countries, with North America, Europe, Asia and China being the main market areas.

Amer Sports Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was founded in 1950. On April 1, 2019, Amer
Sports Corporation was acquired by a consortium consisting of ANTA Sports Products Limited (a sportswear
company in China, “ANTA Sports”), FountainVest Partners (private equity firm in Asia), Anamered
Investments Inc. (an investment vehicle owned by Chip Wilson) and Tencent Holdings Limited (a technology
company in Asia), each of which initially owned their interests in Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited, an
indirect parent of Amer Sports Corporation following the acquisition, through Amer Sports Holding
(Cayman) Limited (the “Acquisition”).

In 2022, in preparation for a potential initial public offering, the Group undertook a reorganization
pursuant to which Amer Sports Holding (Cayman) Limited exchanged its shares of Amer Sports Holding
(HK) Limited for new shares of Amer Sports Management Holding (Cayman) Limited, the new holding
company parent of Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited. Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited is the
immediate parent of Amer Sports Holding 3 Oy, the predecessor entity of the Company (the “predecessor
entity”). Amer Sports Corporation is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the predecessor entity.

**2.** **Significant Accounting Policies**

**Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The reorganization noted above was accounted for as a capital reorganization applying the predecessor
accounting method. Under predecessor accounting, the Group carries forward the predecessor carrying
values of the net assets and liabilities assumed as previously reflected in the financial statements of the
predecessor entity and the comparative balances are presented on that basis except for restatements due to
changes in accounting principles, classification and corrections of errors as disclosed below in note 3.

The reorganization was applied fully retrospectively, so that the Company’s share capital and outstanding
ordinary shares are retrospectively presented in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity
for the comparative periods as of December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020. The same
basis of outstanding ordinary shares has been applied for the earnings per share calculation for the
comparative periods.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of U.S. dollars (USD). The presented
figures and percentages are subject to rounding adjustments, which may cause discrepancies between the
sum of the individual figures and the presented aggregated column and row totals. The figures have been
prepared under the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial instruments that are measured
at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period as well as derivative financial
instruments at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies below. The consolidated financial statements


-----

have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of the business.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain accounting estimates.
The areas that require a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed below.

The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been authorized for issue by the Board of
Directors on August 11, 2023.

**Principles of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and
include all subsidiaries over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity where the Group is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Companies acquired during the
financial year have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date when control was
obtained. Similarly, divested subsidiaries are included up to the date when control has been relinquished.

The ownership of the subsidiary shares within the Group are eliminated using the acquisition method.
The transferred consideration and all the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired company are
measured at fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the total
transferred consideration exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets.

Intercompany transactions, profit distribution as well as intercompany receivables, liabilities and
unrealized gains between Group companies are eliminated in consolidation.

**Change in accounting principles and correction of errors**

Certain amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of loss
and other comprehensive income and loss, consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statement
of changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit) for all periods presented have been restated due to changes in
classification resulting from changes in accounting principle and due to correction of errors. The impact and
description of these restatements are disclosed in note 3. Throughout the consolidated financial statements,
columns indicating figures that have been restated, are indicated with the label restated.

**Macroeconomic environment**

Two major events that impacted the business of the Group during the reporting periods were the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.

COVID-19 pandemic

The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) caused governments and public health
officials to impose restrictions and recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus. In 2020, the
Company took several temporary measures, including temporary layoffs, a travel and recruitment freeze,
postponing certain projects and temporary store closings negatively influencing revenue. In 2022 and 2021,
the COVID-19 pandemic did not have any major negative impact on the Company’s operations.

The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s operations, and in turn, its operating
results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted. At the current time, management does not anticipate any long-term adverse effects, but continues
to monitor any effects on inventories and other significant estimates.

Russia-Ukraine conflict

As a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed against Russia, the
Group put all its shipments to Russia on hold on February 26, 2022 and suspended all significant commercial
activities in Russia by the end of fiscal year 2022 indefinitely, including store, e-commerce channels, and
shipments to the Company’s wholesale partners. The Group’s sales in Russia were USD 56.0 million in 2021


-----

and decreased to USD 18.7 million in 2022. The total assets of our Russian subsidiary ASRUS ZAO Amer
Sports amounted to USD 22.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company maintains a leased office space
in Russia and a limited number of employees to safeguard the operations of the entity, file statutory
financial statements and monitor the local market to secure the Company’s global brand assets.

**Assets held for sale and discontinued operations**

Assets or a disposal group of assets and liabilities is categorized as held for sale when the economic
benefits gained from it will be accrued primarily from its sale rather than from continuous use. Assets or
disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and
disclosed as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of financial position. These assets are not
amortized or depreciated.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset or a disposal
group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs
to sell of an asset or a disposal group, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously
recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset or a
disposal group is recognized at the date of derecognition.

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that has been disposed of or will be
disposed of in accordance with a coordinated plan. It represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations. Any gain or loss from disposal, together with the profit or loss of a
discontinued operation until the date of disposal, is reported separately from income and expenses of the
continuing operations in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. The
prior periods in these statements are presented on a comparative basis. Intercompany income and expenses
between continuing and discontinued operations are eliminated.

More details on the assets held for sale and discontinued operations are disclosed under note 29.

**New and amended standards and interpretations**

The Group has applied the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations that
are required to be applied as of January 1, 2022:

  - IAS 37 (amendment): Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract—no material impact

  - IAS 16 (amendment): Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use—no material
impact

  - IFRS 3 (amendment): Reference to the Conceptual Framework—no material impact

   - Small changes to various standards or interpretations as part of the annual improvements to IFRS
project—no material impact

_New IFRS standards not yet effective_

The following standards that are issued but not yet effective will be adopted in 2023 or later:

  - IAS 1 (amendment): Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

  - IAS 1 (amendment): Disclosure of Accounting Policies

  - IAS 8 (amendment): Definition of Accounting Estimates

  - IAS 12 (amendment): Deferred tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

   - Small changes to various standards or interpretations as part of the annual improvements to IFRS
project

Management has concluded that the adoption of any of the above accounting pronouncements, that
were issued but not effective for the period ended December 31, 2022, will not have a material impact on the
Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**Foreign currency transactions and translation**

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in USD. The functional currency of
the parent company is EUR, while the functional currency for each subsidiary is its local currency or the
currency in which the subsidiary mainly operates. Transactions involving the translation to the respective
functional currencies of values denominated in foreign currencies are classified as monetary or non-monetary,
thereby defining the measurement and recognition of foreign currency translation gains and losses
applicable to a transaction.

The Group companies record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate on the transaction date or at
an estimated rate sufficiently close to the rate on the transaction date. Assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies that are outstanding at the end of the financial year are translated at the closing rate of
exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to operational
transactions are presented within operating expenses above Operating profit. Exchange rate gains and losses
on foreign currency-denominated loans and other receivables and liabilities connected with financing
transactions are recorded at their net values as finance income and expenses.

The consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss is translated into U.S.
dollars by consolidating each calendar month separately using the actual daily average for the month,
whereby the sum of the twelve calendar months represents the whole year. Translation differences arising
from the translation of the net investment in non-U.S. operations are booked to translation differences in
other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated amount of translation
differences relating to the disposed foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one party and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another party. These include both non-derivative financial instruments,
such as accounts receivables and payables, and derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange
contracts.

**Financial assets**

Categorization and measurement

In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial assets are categorized as:

I. financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

II. financial assets measured at amortized cost

III. financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and loss (OCI)

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the contractual cash flow
characteristics of the financial asset and the Group’s business model for managing them. All purchases or
sales of financial assets are recognized on the settlement date.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial

assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily
required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives are classified at fair value through profit and loss unless
they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at
fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss. Assets in this category are classified as current assets, except for maturities
over 12 months after the balance sheet date.

The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:

   - the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order
to collect contractual cash flows; and


-----

   - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and
are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized,
modified or impaired. Financial assets are included in current assets, except for maturities over 12 months
after the balance sheet date.

The Group’s financial assets at amortized cost include accounts receivables, other non-current financial
assets and other non-interest yielding receivables.

The Group measures financial assets at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) if both of the following

conditions are met:

   - the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect
contractual cash flows and selling; and

   - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

For financial assets at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and
impairment losses or reversals are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive
income and loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The
remaining fair value changes are recognized in OCI.

Financial assets at fair value through OCI are measured at their fair value by applying the market
prices at the balance sheet date or some other determination of value used by the Company. The change in
fair value is presented in fair value and other reserves under shareholders’ equity. Fair value changes are
transferred from shareholders’ equity to the consolidated statement of loss when the asset is sold or its
value has been impaired such that an impairment loss must be recognized. Financial assets at fair value
through OCI whose fair value cannot be determined reliably are measured at cost or a lower value if they
are impaired. Financial assets at fair value through OCI are included in non-current assets unless the
investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial
assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group substantially transferred all rewards and risks
associated with the ownership. In the case of sales of trade receivables, essentially all rewards and risks are
transferred to the buyer of the receivables.

Impairment

Loss allowances are recognized for expected credit losses (ECL) on a financial asset that is measured at
amortized cost or at fair value through OCI. For trade receivables, the Group adopts the so-called simplified
approach, which does not require the recognition of periodic changes in credit risk, but rather the
accounting of an expected credit loss calculated over the entire life of the credit (lifetime ECL) according to
the provision matrix approach. ECLs of accounts receivable are measured on a collective basis. The
grouping is based on geographical region, customer rating, the type of collateral or whether the receivables
are covered by trade credit insurance as well as the type of customer. The ECL model is forward-looking and
the expected default rates are based on the realized losses in the past based on the previous three years
considering the time value of money, probability-weighted outcome, supportable information available
without undue cost or effort about the past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic
conditions. The lifetime ECL allowances are calculated using the gross carrying amounts of the outstanding
trade receivables and the expected default rates with probability-weighted outcomes. The historically
observed default rates are updated annually. In addition, forward-looking specific provision is prepared in
cases where the basic ECL allowance based on the historical loss data does not cover expected losses, which
includes the impact of expected changes in the economic, regulatory and technological environment (such
as industry outlook, GDP, employment, politics), and external market indicators. The estimates are based on


-----

a systematic, on-going review and evaluation performed as part of the credit-risk evaluation process. The
specific provision is updated on a quarterly basis.

**Financial liabilities**

In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial liabilities are categorized as:

I. financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

II. financial liabilities measured at amortized cost

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives that are classified at fair value

through profit and loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially carried at fair value. Transaction costs are

included in the original carrying amount of financial liabilities. All financial liabilities are subsequently
carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities are classified as current
liabilities, except for maturities over 12 months after the balance sheet date, in which case they are classified
as long-term liabilities.

Current financial liabilities include current interest-bearing liabilities, accounts payables and other
current liabilities. Accounts payables correspond primarily to trade payables. They also include payables
that have been transferred to a vendor financing program, as there is no material difference in the nature or
terms of the liabilities compared to other trade payables.

Long-term financial liabilities include long-term loans from financial institutions, loans from related
parties and other liabilities.

**Derivatives**

The Group’s derivative instruments may include foreign exchange forward contracts and options,
interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency swaps. Foreign exchange forward contracts and
options are used to hedge against changes in the value of receivables and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency, and interest rate swaps and interest rate options to hedge against interest rate risk. Crosscurrency swaps are used to hedge against changes in value of foreign currency denominated receivables and
liabilities and against interest rate risk.

Foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swaps and options and cross currency
swaps are measured at fair value on the day that the Group becomes a party to the contract. Subsequent
measurement is also at fair value. Foreign exchange derivatives are measured at fair value using the closing
rates quoted by the European Central Bank on the reporting date together with common pricing models that
are used for valuation of foreign exchange forward contracts and options. The fair values of interest rate
and cross currency swaps are calculated as the current value of future cash flows. Interest rate options are
valued with year-end interest rates together with common option pricing models.

Gains and losses from fair value measurement are treated in accordance with the purpose of the
derivative financial instrument. For maturities below 12 months after the balance sheet date, the fair value
of the derivatives is presented in prepaid expenses and other receivables or other liabilities. For maturities over
12 months, the fair value is presented in other non-current assets or other liabilities.

Changes in the value of derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded
as finance income and expenses, except for when they are associated with hedging the cash flow from
operating activities, in which case they are recorded in other operating income and expenses.

**Hedge accounting**

The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to foreign exchange derivatives that hedge material cash
flows from operating activities. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is recognized
in the fair value and other reserves under shareholders’ equity. Any ineffective component, however, will be


-----

immediately recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss.
The cumulative change in gains or losses for the effective hedges is transferred to the income statement for
the period when the hedged item is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive
income and loss.

When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or if the hedge does not meet the requirements set for
hedge accounting under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, any cumulative gain or loss recorded in equity
remains in equity until the forecasted transaction is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss. When the forecasted cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recorded in other operating income and expenses
in the case of an operating cash flow hedge.

When initiating hedge accounting, the Group documents the correlation between the hedged item and
the hedging instruments, as well as the Group’s risk management objective and hedge initiation strategy.
The Group documents and evaluates the effectiveness of hedges when initiating hedging and on a quarterly
basis by examining the degree to which the hedging instrument offsets changes in the fair value and cash
flow of the hedged item.

The Group does not hedge the net investment in foreign subsidiary operations with derivatives.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue comprises sale of products and services, and license fees. Revenue is presented net of value
added tax, discounts, incentives, rebates earned by customers, and estimated returns.

Management applies the following five step model when determining the timing and amount of
revenue recognition:

1. identifying the contracts with customers,

2. identifying the separate performance obligations,

3. determining the transaction price,

4. allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations, and

5. recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.

Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the products and services are transferred to
the customer in accordance with the terms of delivery at an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those products and services in the ordinary course of the
Group’s activities.

Revenue recognized from services comprises mainly freight services in the Group’s operating segments.
The revenue from the freight services is recognized at a point in time upon the delivery of the goods when
the control has been transferred to the customer.

The Group sells products and services through three channels: wholesale, own retail and ecommerce,
with the latter two belonging to direct-to-consumer (DTC).

In wholesale, volume rebates, performance bonuses and payment term discounts are offered to certain
major customers. The Group typically applies the expected value method to estimate the variable consideration
for the expected future rebates and performance bonuses. Certain contracts provide wholesale customers
with a right to return goods within a specified period. The Group recognizes a refund liability as a reduction
of revenue and a corresponding right of return asset as reduction of cost of goods sold based on the
expected future return rates derived from historical data.


-----

In own retail and ecommerce, revenue is recognized when control of the products is transferred to the
customer, which occurs upon delivery to the customer or point of sale for sales in own retail stores. In
ecommerce, the products sold online can be returned within 14−30 days of receipt of the products. For
expected returns, the Group recognizes a refund liability as a reduction of revenue and a corresponding right
of return asset as reduction of cost of goods sold based on the expected future return rates derived from
historical data. A contract liability is recognized from the sale of gift cards in own retail and ecommerce. The
Group expects to be entitled to a breakage amount. It recognizes breakage amount as revenue in proportion
to the pattern of rights exercised by customers based on historical data.

The Group provides warranties that promise the customer that the delivered product is as typically
specified in the contract and covers general repairs for defects that existed at the time of sale, as required by
law. These assurance-type warranties are accounted for under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
_and Contingent Assets._

Revenue obtained from other companies is booked to license income when such companies manufacture
or sell products bearing the Group’s trademarks. License income based on fixed license agreements is
recognized evenly throughout the financial year, while license income determined by sales volumes is
recognized during the financial year as the licensee generates sales revenue. The non-refundable minimum
guarantees related to certain licensing agreements are for functional intellectual properties, while the guarantee
revenue is recognized at the point in time the control of the license is transferred to the customer.

**Pension plans**

The Group’s pension arrangements comply with the local rules and practices of the countries where the
Group operates. The Group’s pension arrangements are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.
Under defined contribution based plans, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund)
and does not have any legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. Under defined contribution
plans, the Group’s contributions are recorded as an expense in the period to which they relate.

Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. The
defined benefit plans are partially or fully funded through payments to insurance companies or contributions
to trustee-administered funds. In defined benefit plans, the pension expenses recognized in the consolidated
statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss are determined using the projected unit credit
method, which calculates the present value of the obligation and the related service costs. The pension liability
is measured by calculating the present value of future pension obligations, discounted using the market
yield on high quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries where there is no deep market for
such bonds. The defined benefit plan asset is measured at fair market value as of the reporting date. The net
liability (asset) recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position is the present value of the
pension obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.

All actuarial gains and losses relating to post-employment benefits are recognized in full in other
comprehensive income and loss. For other long-term employee benefits, the Group recognizes actuarial
gains and losses immediately in the consolidated statement of loss. All past service costs are recognized
immediately in the consolidated statement of loss when the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement
occurs. Net interest expense (income) is determined based on the net defined benefit liability (asset) and the
discount rate at the beginning of the year. Expenses related to defined benefit post-employment plans are
reported as follows:

   - service cost

   - net interest expense

   - remeasurement components under OCI. Actuarial gains and losses are not classified to the
consolidated statement of loss in subsequent periods.

**Share-based payments**

The Group’s key employees have been granted options under a share-based incentive plan—the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2019. Options settled in shares only are measured on the grant date.


-----

Options settled in cash or shares at the election of certain employees are remeasured to fair value at the end
of each reporting period until settlement. The share-based payments expense is recognized over the
requisite service period with the offsetting credit to equity for options that are settled in shares, and with the
offsetting credit to liabilities for options that are settled in cash or shares at the election of certain employees,
when it is probable that the service vesting condition and non-market performance condition, if applicable,
will be met.

**Income taxes**

_Current income taxes_

Current income taxes comprise the taxes for the financial year calculated based on the result for the
period and in accordance with the tax legislation of each company’s local domicile as well as assessed or
returned taxes for previous financial periods.

_Deferred taxes_

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on all temporary differences between the book and tax
base of assets in accordance with the tax rate at the balance sheet date or with the substantially enacted future
tax rate. Temporary differences arise from factors such as unused tax losses, depreciation differences,
provisions, defined benefit pension plans, the fair valuation of derivative financial instruments, the internal
inventory margin as well as measurements to fair value of assets in connection with business acquisitions.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized for unremitted earnings of subsidiaries to the extent that they
are expected to be permanently invested in international operations. These earnings, the amount of which
cannot be practicably computed, could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or
if the Company were to sell the shareholdings in the subsidiaries. A deferred tax asset is recognized as a
result of unused tax losses and other temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that these can be
utilized in future financial periods. For the assessment of probability, in addition to past performance and
the respective prospects for the foreseeable future, appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into
consideration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same tax authority and the same taxable entity, and are expected to reverse in a period or periods in which
the tax loss or credit can be utilized.

**Segment information**

The Group’s organizational structure comprises the following reportable segments for financial
reporting purposes: Technical Apparel consisting of the brands Arc’teryx and Peak Performance, Outdoor
Performance consisting of the brands Salomon, Atomic, Armada and ENVE, and Ball & Racquet Sports
consisting of the brands Wilson, Demarini, Louisville Slugger, Evoshield and ATEC. The Group reports
revenue for four geographical areas: EMEA, Americas, Greater China and Asia Pacific excluding Greater
China.

The CEO is the chief operating decision-maker who monitors the operating results of the segments to
assess performance and make decisions about resource allocation.

**Business combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred
in a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred, and
liabilities incurred towards the former owners of the acquired entity. Acquisition-related costs are recognized
as expenses in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss in the period
in which the costs are incurred and the related services are received.

**Intangible assets**

The Group’s intangible assets and goodwill primarily result from the acquisition of Amer Sports
Corporation and its subsidiaries by Amer Sports Holding Oy on April 1, 2019. Following the initial


-----

recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses, if any. The useful life of intangible assets is assessed as either finite or indefinite.

_Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives_

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise brand names and trademarks. As the brand
names and trademarks are core to the business and as there is no foreseeable limit to the future cash flows
generated by the intangible assets, brand names and trademarks are assessed as indefinitely lived. Brand
names and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment at least on an
annual basis (see impairment of assets below). Impairment testing is performed by comparing the
recoverable amount of the asset to its carrying value. Any resulting impairment loss is recorded in the
consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss.

_Intangible assets with finite useful lives_

Intangible assets with a finite useful life consist of patents and software licenses, and are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the useful life of 3 to 15 years.

Patents and software licenses are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether
there is any indication of impairment and if any impairment indication exists, the asset is then tested for
impairment.

Development expenses are capitalized when they meet the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible
_Assets and amortized during their useful lives._

The Group capitalizes development costs as intangible assets only when the following criteria are met:

   - the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset exists,

   - there is an intent to complete and an ability to use or sell the intangible asset,

   - the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits,

   - there are adequate resources available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible
asset, and

   - there is the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
development.

_Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net
identifiable assets measured at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at historical cost less any
accumulated impairment losses and is not amortized. Goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating units
(CGU) and are tested for impairment annually and if there are triggering events by comparing the
recoverable amount of a CGU to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated
statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss, if the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its
recoverable amount.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis in order to write down the cost of the assets to their
residual values over their expected useful lives, adjusting for any impairment. The depreciation periods are:

**Asset category** **Estimated useful life**

Buildings and constructions 25–40 years

Machinery and equipment 3–10 years

Leasehold improvements shorter of the lease term or useful life


-----

Land areas are not depreciated.

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether
there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset is then tested for impairment
by comparing its recoverable amount to its carrying value. Impairment losses are recorded in the consolidated
statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss.

**Leases**

At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability at the lease commencement date.

The lease contracts under IFRS 16 Leases consist mainly of real estate (e.g. retail stores, offices,
warehouses) and cars, where the Group acts as a lessee.

The Group has elected to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which
the lease term is shorter than 12 months and on lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of lowvalue (e.g. laptops, mobile phones; below USD 5 thousand). The lease expenses for short-term and lowvalue contracts as well as for lease contracts with variable leases based on net sales of the leased premises are
recognized as rent expenses over the lease term in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss.

_Lease liabilities_

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be
readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the incremental borrowing rate is
applied. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various
external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and the type of the
leased asset.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the fixed payments
(including the in-substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate,
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, and the exercise price under a purchase
option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the
Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease
unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The Group applies judgment in evaluating
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise or not to exercise the option to extend or terminate the lease. It
considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the extension or
termination.

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, if there is a
change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if
the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or
if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. A corresponding adjustment is done to the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset, or it is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Right-of-use assets_

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the
underlying assets or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.


-----

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement
date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group
by the end of the lease or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase
option. In that case, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which
is determined on the same basis as for the property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset
is reduced by potential impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

In 2022 and 2021, the Group applied the amendments to IFRS 16 Leases as an optional practical
expedient to allow lessees not to account for rent concessions as lease modifications if they are a direct
consequence of COVID-19 and meet certain conditions. The practical expedient applies only if the revised
consideration is substantially the same or less than the original consideration, the reduction in lease payments
relates to payments due on or before June 30, 2022, and no other substantive changes have been made to
the terms of the lease. All those rent concessions that met the aforementioned conditions were recognized as
variable lease payment reductions in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income
and loss.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Group’s operations have been divided into cash generating units (CGU) representing the Group’s
brands and reflecting the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A
cash generating unit determined for the impairment testing purposes is the smallest group of assets generating
cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable
amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.

Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU to its
carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use (“VIU”). VIU has been calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each
CGU (refer to note 9 for further details).

An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive
income and loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU,
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.

**Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost calculated according to the first-in-first-out principle or
the net realizable value. For self-manufactured products, the cost includes direct wages and raw material
costs as well as a portion of the indirect costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the
sale.

When circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down below cost no longer exist
or when there is clear evidence of an increase in realizable value, the amount of the write-down previously
recorded is reversed.

**Provisions**

Obligations arising as the consequence of a past event, which are legal or which the Company has an
actual obligation to settle and are considered certain or likely to occur, are recognized in the consolidated
statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. They are presented in the consolidated statement
of financial position as provisions when it is probable that the resources will be transferred out of the


-----

Group but the precise amount or timing is not known. The most important regular provisions are due to
the repair or replacement of products during the warranty period. These provisions are determined on the
basis of historical experience. A provision for reorganization is made when the Group has drawn up a detailed
reorganization plan and announced the reorganization.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax
rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss.

**Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions**

When preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s management makes judgments and
estimates influencing the content of the consolidated financial statements and it must exercise its judgment
regarding the application of accounting policies. The judgments and estimates are based on a set of underlying
data that may include management’s historical experience, knowledge of current event and conditions, and
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management continuously evaluates
the judgments and estimates it uses. These estimates have been applied in a manner that is consistent with
prior periods. There are no known trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that the Group believes will
materially affect the methodology or assumptions used in making these judgments and estimates in the
consolidated financial statements.

The following are the accounting policies subject to judgments and estimates that the Group believes
could have the most significant impact on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Actual results may differ from these estimates. Any changes in the estimates and assumptions are
recognized in the period in which the estimate or assumption is revised.

_Impairment of non-financial assets_

The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of
impairment tests whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are nevertheless assessed at least once a year.

More details of the impairment are disclosed under note 9.

_Provisions_

Provisions are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legal or
actual obligation for the Company to settle an obligation arising as the consequence of a past event that is
considered certain or likely to occur. The most important regular provisions are due to the repair or
replacement of products during the warranty period. These provisions are determined on the basis of
historical experience. The provisions recognized represent management’s best estimate of the present value
of the future costs assumed to be incurred. The actual costs may differ from the estimated.

More details on the provisions are disclosed in note 21.

_Accounts receivable_

The Group has a significant number of customers which minimizes the concentration of credit risks.
Ongoing estimates are done related to the ability to collect the Group’s accounts receivables and maintain
an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the ability of the Group’s customers to make the
required payments. The historical levels of credit losses are considered to make judgments about the
creditworthiness of the customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.

More details on the aging and valuation provisions of the accounts receivables are disclosed in note 28.

_Inventories_

Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which requires an estimate of the
products’ future selling prices. When assessing the net realizable value of the inventories, the Group


-----

considers multiple factors and uses estimates related to fluctuations in inventory levels, aging of inventory,
customer behavior and anticipated sales volume, seasonality, expected selling prices and selling costs.

More details on the inventory provisions are disclosed in note 16.

_Income taxes_

Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and
liabilities and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized. The Group is also subject to income
taxes in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes.
There may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the
ordinary course of business. The Group anticipates questions arising in tax audits and recognizes liabilities
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will
impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

More details on the income taxes are disclosed under note 12.

_Pension plans_

The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on
an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (or
income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying
amount of pension obligations.

The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate
that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required
to settle the pension obligations. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on
current market conditions (see note 8).

More details on the pension plans are disclosed under note 8.

_Share-based payments_

Options granted will vest upon satisfaction of service and performance conditions, and an exit event (a
public offering of the shares of the Company or a sale of the controlling majority of the shares in the
Company or business assets) (the “exit event”), which is a non-market performance condition. For options
with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the
number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures, and is adjusted to reflect
those awards that do ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is based on management’s best estimate of expected
forfeitures, taking into consideration historical trends and expected future behavior. For options with a nonmarket performance condition (i.e. exit event), the Company recognizes the expense if and when the Company
concludes that it is probable that the exit event will be achieved. No share-based payment expense has been
recognized in these consolidated financial statements since the likelihood of occurrence of such condition was
not deemed to be probable during any reporting period. The Company reassesses the probability of
achieving the non-market performance condition at each reporting date.

The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation
model including any market performance conditions and excluding the impact of any service and nonmarket performance vesting conditions.

**3.** **Changes in accounting principles and correction of errors**

Changes in accounting principles

The Company made certain reclassifications to the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of
cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit) for all periods presented
to improve readability, comparability to peers and to make it easier to understand the Company’s financial
performance. By presenting a more concise and focused view of its primary statements, Management aims


-----

to provide a clearer picture of its net assets, financial position and results of operations and facilitate
meaningful analysis of its consolidated financial statements. The reclassifications and adjustments made
included the Company’s election to change the reporting currency in which the consolidated financial
statements are presented from the Euro to the U.S. Dollar. The following summarizes the reclassifications
and adjustments made and presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

  - Reporting Currency: The Company elected to change the reporting currency in which the
Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented from the Euro to the U.S. Dollar.

  - License income: Historically, License income was presented as a separate line item on the face of
the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. For all periods presented,
the Company reclassified License income to combine License income with the line-item Revenue.

  - Research and development expenses: Historically, Research and development expenses were
presented as a separate line item on the face of the consolidated statement of loss and other
comprehensive income and loss. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified Research and
development expenses to combined Research and development expenses with the line item
Administrative and other expenses.

  - Impairment losses: Historically, impairment losses on goodwill were presented within the line item
Administrative and other expenses and impairment of trade receivables were presented within the
line item Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive
income and loss. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified impairment losses from the
above-mentioned line items into a separate line-item Impairment losses on the consolidated statement
of loss and other comprehensive income and loss.

   - Right-of-use assets: Historically, the Company presented right-of-use assets relating to land,
buildings and constructions and machinery and equipment as individual line items on the consolidated
statement of financial position. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified these line items
and combined them into one line item Right-of-use assets.

   - The Company elected to change the format of the presentation of its consolidated statement of cash
flows by changing that the reconciliation for operating cash flows begins with net loss instead of
Earnings before taxes. Furthermore, the Company elected to break out and present several items as
separate line items in the operating and financing cash flow section.

   - The Company elected to change the format of the presentation of its consolidated statement of
changes in shareholders’ equity by combining the categories Fair value and other reserves and Other
OCI items into the category Cash flow hedge reserve given that the positions solely relate to effects
of the changes in measurement of the Company’s currency cash flow hedges and related tax effects.

The respective disclosures in the notes to these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted
accordingly.

Correction of errors

In addition, the Company identified several corrections of errors, that were concluded material to the
previously published predecessor consolidated financial statements of Amer Sports Holding 3 Oy.

In accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the presented
errors have been corrected retrospectively by restating every affected financial line item for all periods
presented. The following table summarizes the impacts of these corrections of errors on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements adjusted for changes resulting from accounting principles and classification.

(a) The Company granted options to key employees under its share-based incentive plan that vest
upon satisfaction of service and performance conditions, as well as an exit event. The exit event,
which is a non-market performance condition, is defined as a public offering of the shares of the
Company or a sale of the controlling majority of the shares in the Company or business assets,
together with the exit event. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Company
recognizes expense relating to options with a non-market performance condition, if and when the
Company concludes that it is probable that the exit event will be achieved. The assessment when


-----

an initial public offering is probable involves judgment and careful consideration of all relevant
facts and circumstances including the assessment of factors that are outside of the Company’s
discretion. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that as of the
reporting dates presented in the consolidated financial statements, a successful initial public offering
was not yet deemed probable. Accordingly, the effects of the reversal of share-based compensation
expense recognized in the amount of USD 8.9 million and USD 12.7 million for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were recognized in the consolidated
financial statements. The related tax effect of increased income tax expenses and deferred tax
liabilities amounted to USD 2.1 million and USD 3.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

(b) In 2018 the Company announced a strategic review of its cycling business, consisting of the Mavic
and Enve assets. During the fiscal year 2019, the Company classified the Mavic business as
discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
_Discontinued Operations. In June 2019, the Company sold the Mavic business to a third party._
Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that the transitional services
provided to Mavic business should not have been classified as discontinued operations in the
consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. Accordingly, the
impairment loss on trade receivables between Amer Sports and Mavic S.A.S. in the amount of
USD 8.2 million recorded in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was reclassified to
continued operations at December 31, 2020.

(c) The Company continued to depreciate and amortize the disposal groups’ non-current assets
related to Precor and Suunto, which were classified as held for sale. In accordance with IFRS 5 Non_current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations an entity shall not depreciate or amortize_
a non-current asset while it is classified as part of a disposal group that is classified as held for
sale. Accordingly, the effects of the reversal of recognition of depreciation and amortization expense
in the amount of USD 1.0 million and USD 2.7 million in relation to Suunto for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were corrected in the consolidated financial
statements. The accumulated reversal effect in December 31, 2022 did not affect net results of
discontinued operations as the reduced amortization and depreciation expense recognized in 2021
and 2022 was offset by an increased loss upon disposal recognized in 2022. Additionally, the
effect of the reversal of recognition of amortization and depreciation expense in the amount of
USD 5.1 million in relation to Precor for the year ended December 31, 2021 was corrected in the
consolidated financial statements. The reversal effect relating to Precor did not affect the net results
of discontinued operations as the reduced amortization and depreciation expense recognized was
offset by a decreased gain upon disposal.

Furthermore, in the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022, the
Company continued to classify certain assets and liabilities relating to continuing activities with
Suunto as assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. Upon
reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that these items should not be
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale.
Accordingly, the effects of reclassing USD 10.5 million from assets held for sale to intangible
assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, other non-current assets, accounts
receivable, net and inventories in the amount of USD 2.2 million, USD 1.1 million, USD 0.1 million,
USD 0.5 million, USD 6.4 million and USD 0.2 million, respectively, were corrected in the
consolidated financial statements.

Furthermore, the effects of reclassing USD 3.8 million from liabilities directly associated with
assets held for sale to accounts payable and other liabilities in the amount of USD 0.6 million,
USD 3.2 million, respectively, were also corrected in the consolidated financial statements.

(d) As of December 31, 2022, the Company identified an understatement of USD 11.5 million in its
inventory and other liabilities balances related to items in transit for which the Company retained
ownership upon point of shipment. The effects of recognizing the inventory in transit on the
consolidated statement of financial position are corrected in the consolidated financial statements.


-----

(e) During fiscal year 2022, the Company acquired an interest in Dongguan Liesheng Electronic
Technology Co. Ltd (“Liesheng”) accounted for as a non-current financial asset and recognized at
fair value through OCI. As prescribed in the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, upon reassessing the
facts and circumstances, including available market data, the Company concluded that as of
December 31, 2022, a decrease in the fair value of the financial asset in the amount of
USD 10.9 million was required. The effects of recognizing this change in fair value recorded
through OCI on the carrying amount of the investment is corrected in the consolidated financial
statements.

(f) The Group had open accounts receivable balances in Argentina related to a single distributor,
which was not able to pay its outstanding invoice amounts due to abroad payment restrictions by
the Central Bank of Argentina. Pursuant to an agreement reached, the negotiated part of the
accounts receivables were converted to a loan with a specific payment plan. Upon reassessing the
facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that the converted receivable balances were noncurrent in nature and improperly classified in current assets. Accordingly, as of December 31,
2022, the Company reclassified a net amount of USD 15.2 million to other non-current assets,
comprising of USD 21.4 million from prepaid expenses and other receivables, which has partly been
offset by a reclass of USD 6.2 million from accounts receivables. As of December 31, 2021, the
Company reclassified USD 5.2 million from prepaid expenses and other receivables to other noncurrent assets.

(g) During fiscal year 2022, the Group recorded an impairment loss in the amount of USD 40.2 million
on goodwill attributed to Peak Performance. The estimation of an impairment loss requires a
significant amount of judgement and use of estimates and assumptions such as forecasted cash
flows, estimation of discount rates and future growth rates. Upon reassessing the facts and
circumstances, the Company concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the impairment loss to be
recognized allocated to Peak Performance should be increased by USD 160.0 million. The effects of
recognizing this additional impairment loss, which is allocated to goodwill and trademarks in the
amount of USD 140.9 million and USD 19.1 million, respectively, were corrected in the consolidated
financial statements. The adjustment entailed a decrease in income tax expenses and deferred tax
liabilities amounting to USD 4.8 million as well as a correction of the translation differences
amounting to USD 1.1 million.

(h) Historically, the Company presented tax liabilities related to certain tax risks in the line-item
current tax liabilities. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that
the balances were non-current in nature and improperly classified in current liabilities. Therefore,
such tax liabilities amounting to USD 20.8 million, USD 21.3 million and USD 21.6 million as
of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively, were reclassified to
long-term tax liabilities.

(i) The Company corrected rebate accruals in accounts receivable, net. Accordingly, the Company
adjusted revenue by the amount of USD -2.6 million, USD -1.5 million and USD 0.8 million, cost
of goods sold by the amount of USD -1.5 million, USD nil and USD nil as well as income tax
expense by the amount of USD -0.3 million, USD -0.4 million and USD 0.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Furthermore, the Company adjusted inventories in the amount of USD 1.5 million, USD nil and
USD nil, accounts receivable, net by the amount of USD 4.1 million, USD 6.6 million and USD
8.1 million, current tax liabilities by the amount USD 1.4 million, USD 1.7 million and USD
2.0 million as well as accumulated deficit and other by the amount of USD 4.2 million, USD
5.0 million and USD 6.1 million as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021,
respectively.

The respective disclosures in the notes to these consolidated financial statements have been corrected
accordingly.

The following table summarizes the impacts of these corrections of errors on the Group’s consolidated
financial statements adjusted for changes resulting from reclassifications.

**4.** **SEGMENT REPORTING**

The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) reviews results of operations to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. Based on the current reporting structures,
decision-making processes and considering the aggregation criteria in IFRS 8.12, the Company identified
three reportable segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance as well as Ball & Racquet Sports.

**Operating and reportable segments**

The Company has four operating segments: Technical Apparel, Salomon, Winter Sports Equipment
and Ball & Racquet Sports. As permitted by IFRS 8 Operating segments, the Company assessed, based on
the qualitative aggregation criteria mentioned in IFRS 8.12 and on a quantitative analysis based on gross
margins, if Salomon and Winter Sports Equipment are similar and could be aggregated to one reportable
segment. The following aggregation criteria were analyzed by the Company: Nature of the products and
services, nature of the production processes, type or class of customer for the products and services and
methods used to distribute the products or provide the service. Based on the Company’s assessment, the
Company concluded that the operating segments Salomon and Winter Sports Equipment are similar and
can be aggregated into the reportable segment Outdoor Performance.

Therefore, the Company identified three reportable segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance
as well as Ball & Racquet Sports.

The Company measures each operating segment’s performance based on revenue and adjusted
operating profit as these are the measures used by the CODM for assessing the performance of operating
segments. Each of the segments includes different brands and comprises a range of products.

Technical Apparel

Technical Apparel includes outdoor apparel, footwear and accessories and consists of the Arc’teryx
and Peak Performance brands.

Outdoor Performance

Outdoor Performance includes outdoor apparel, footwear, accessories and winter sports equipment
and consists of our Salomon, Atomic, Armada and ENVE brands. While the operating segments Salomon
and Winter Sports Equipment are separately managed and reported, the operating segments have been
aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar products, production processes, type of customers,
methods used to distribute as well as average gross margins and similar expected growth rates.

Ball & Racquet Sports

Ball & Racquet Sports includes sports equipment, apparel and accessories and consists of our Wilson,
Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield, Atec and Luxilon brands, all of which comprise the Wilson
Sporting Goods portfolio.

**8.** **PENSIONS**

The pension arrangements for the Group companies are based on local regulations and practices in
each country. Amer Sports, Inc. has no employees and therefore had no pension arrangements in place
during the periods presented. The Group’s defined benefit pension plans at the end of the reporting period
relate to the Group’s operating entities. The Group has defined benefit pension plans in the United States,
France, Switzerland, the UK, Germany, Japan, Sweden and Austria. These plans are partially or fully
funded. In some countries the funding is carried out through external pension funds whose assets are not
included in the Group’s assets. Contributions to the funds are made in accordance with local regulations. In
the United States and the UK, the pension plans are closed, and new members are no longer accepted.

The Group’s pension arrangements comply with the local rules and practices of the countries where
the Group operates. The Group’s pension arrangements are either defined contribution or defined benefit
plans. Under defined contribution plans, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund)
and does not have any legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. Under defined contribution
plans, the Group’s contributions are recorded as an expense in the period to which they relate.

Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. In
total, there are 14 post-employment benefit plans qualifying as defined benefit plans. The defined benefit
plans in the USA, the UK and Austria represent approximately 85% of the defined benefit obligation and are
described in more detail:

Sensitivity analysis:

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in one assumption while holding all other
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be
correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial
assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected
unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined
benefit liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change
compared to the prior period.

Equity securities and government bonds have quoted prices in active markets.

Through its defined pension plans the Company is exposed to actuarial risks such as investment risk,
interest rate risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.

The main risk is that additional contributions are required if investment returns are not sufficient to
pay for the benefits. The level of equity returns is a key determinant of overall investment return. The
investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical to asset classes held.

A decrease in discount rates, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an
increase in plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the position in the consolidated statement of
financial position and may give rise to increased cost in the consolidated statement of loss. This effect would
be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings. Additionally, caps on inflationary
increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.

The estimated contributions to the pension plans are USD 8.6 million during 2023.

The weighted average of the duration of the defined benefit obligations was 9.5 years in 2022, 11.7 years
in 2021 and 13.1 years in 2020 (continuing operations).

**Impairment losses by asset type**

An impairment on goodwill amounting to USD 179.0 million and on trademarks amounting to
USD 19.1 million was recognized for Peak Performance in 2022. The recoverable amount for Peak
Performance as of December 31, 2022 is USD 197.2 million and is based on value-in- use calculations. In
2020 or 2021, no impairment losses on goodwill and trademarks were recorded in the continuing operations.

Impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as trademarks, are
performed when the management has identified indications of impairment or once a year when business
plans for the next strategic planning horizon are approved by the management. The Group management uses
assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions, such as economic growth, expected
inflation rates, expected market share, revenue and margin developments.

Goodwill is monitored by management at Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) level, the level at which it
and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment. The CGUs in the Group for
continuing operations are the following: Winter Sports Equipment, Salomon Apparel and Footwear,
Arc’teryx, Ball & Racquet Sports and Peak Performance. Discontinued operations are discussed in note 29.

The impairment tests were calculated during the fourth quarter of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined by the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and
value in use (“VIU”). VIU has been calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each CGU. The
values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the relevant
industries and have been based on historical data from external and internal sources. The key assumptions
used in the estimation of the value in use are set out below.

The VIU of all CGUs were determined by cash flow projections based on a 10-year financial forecast,
of which the first 5-years were prepared by management and approved by the board. To better reflect the
medium-term growth expectations for the CGU in growing markets, financial forecast after first 5-year period
are extrapolated for a further 5-years using declining growth rates which reduces the year five growth rate
down to the long-term growth rate as shown below.

The following table shows the revenue growth rates of the 5-year financial forecast prepared by
management (average of the first five years) for the respective CGUs:

The terminal value is derived from Gordon Growth model. The perpetuity growth is 2% which is in line
with the management’s view on long-term inflation, indicating no growth in real terms. In some cases, when
management expects above or below average growth after the estimated period, the terminal growth rate
may rise to 3% or drop to 1%.

**Impairment Loss:**

Due to the significant rise in the discount rate used in impairment testing and the recent change of
strategic plan for the Peak Performance business, an impairment on goodwill of USD 179.0 million and an
impairment on trademarks of USD 19.1 million for Peak Performance business was recognized in 2022.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

The estimated recoverable amount of Peak Performance exceeded its carrying amount by
USD 14.9 million and approximately USD 30.9 million as of 31 December 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Also, the estimated recoverable amount of Winter Sports Equipment exceeded its carrying amount by
USD 38.9 million, USD 23.6 million and approximately USD 93.4 million as of 31 December 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.

The assumptions applied by management for calculating the recoverable amount are sensitive to
change and could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows
the amount by which these two assumptions would need to change individually for the estimated recoverable
amount to be equal to the carrying amount.

- Note: For the year ended December 31, 2022, management has performed an annual impairment
testing for the CGU of Peak Performance. Within the range of possible estimated recoverable amounts,
management has taken a prudent approach and recognized a full goodwill impairment and allocated
the remaining impairment amount to trademarks. Management is of the view that the impairment
provided is adequate under the prudent scenario.

Based on the valuation of the other CGUs, management is of the view that there are no reasonably
possible changes in the key assumptions of other CGUs that would cause the carrying amount to exceed
the recoverable amount.

**10.** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**

**Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2019**

The objectives of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2019 (“2019 ESOP”) are to align the interest of
the shareholders and key employees in order to increase the value of the Company in the long-term, and to
commit key employees to the Company. The 2019 ESOP provides for awards in the form of stock options to
the Group’s key employees, and it is an equity-settled arrangement, except for stock options granted to
certain employees which allow them to elect for shares or cash settlement.

The maximum number of options that may be granted is 3% of all of the Company’s issued and
outstanding shares.

Subject to a participant’s continued employment, options granted under the 2019 ESOP will vest upon
satisfaction of vesting conditions set out in an award agreement and an exit event (a public offering of the
shares of the Company or a sale of a controlling majority of the shares in the Company or business assets)
(the “exit event”).

In addition to an exit event, 35% of the options granted are time-vested, which vest evenly on an
annual basis over a 5-year period, 65% of the options granted are with Group and/or brand performances.

The vesting of the options is subject to an exit event, which is a non-market performance condition.
No share-based payment cost for equity-settled awards and cash-settled awards has been recognized during
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 since the occurrence of such event was not deemed
probable during any of the reporting periods.

The number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options under the 2019 ESOP were as

No options were exercised during the reporting periods.

Included in the above options are cash-settled awards granted to certain employees. On January 15,
2020, April 1, 2020, January 16, 2021, May 20, 2021 and March 30, 2022, the Group granted 518,493,
57,610, 345,662, 34,566 and 92,177 options, respectively, to certain employees who can elect shares or cash
settlement. The exercise prices of these options granted were EUR 23.60. These options expire at December 31,
2029. The amount of the cash payment, where applicable, is determined based on the share price of the
Company at the time of exercise less the exercise price and relevant taxes.

_Fair value of options granted_

The table above shows a reconciliation between tax expense (2022: USD 48.3 million, 2021:
USD 34.7 million, 2020: USD 26.2 million) and the product of the loss from continuing operations before
income tax expense (2022: USD 182.6 million, 2021: USD 89.8 million, 2020: USD 147.4 million) multiplied
by the average tax rate (2022: -26%; 2021: -39%, 2020: -18%). The average tax rate is a quotient from the
Group’s loss and tax expense. In 2022, it was negative mainly because of an impairment charge for book
purposes for which no deferred taxes could be recorded. It changed in 2020 and 2021 from the prior year,
respectively, because of changes in the mix of profits and losses included in its computation. The taxes at local
rates applicable to earnings in countries concerned (2022: USD -4.3 million, 2021: USD -9.5 million, 2020:
USD -24.4 million) include the aggregate of income taxes prepared by using the local statutory rate in each
individual jurisdiction. The major reconciling items to total tax include unrecognized deferred tax assets
from unused interest expense and tax losses, and tax credits/withholding taxes, which are disclosed in the
respective line items.

The other temporary differences comprise mostly of non-deductible interest expenses. No deferred tax
assets have been recognized for above mentioned unused tax losses and other temporary differences since
their utilization in full in the near future is not probable or the losses have been created in countries where the
possibilities for their utilization are limited. For the assessment of probability, in addition to past
performance and the respective prospects for the foreseeable future, appropriate tax structuring measures
are also taken into consideration. The major part of the unrecognized deferred tax assets originated in
Finland.

Amer Sports does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of subsidiaries to the
extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations. These earnings, the
amount of which cannot be practicably computed, could become subject to additional tax if they were
remitted as dividends or if the Company were to sell the shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

**15. OTHER NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OCI AND CASH**
**AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**

**Other non-current financial assets**

Other non-current financial assets at fair value through OCI consist of shares in unlisted companies
and amounted to USD 8.9 million, USD 0.3 million and USD 0.4 million as of December 31, 2022,
December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively.

On initial recognition, the Group designated the investments in unlisted companies to be measured at
FVOCI since they are not held for trading.

Liesheng, one of the Group’s financial assets at FVOCI, was impaired in 2022. Shares of Liesheng are
not traded in an active market and its fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The fair value of
the Group’s investment in Liesheng as of December 31, 2022 was determined to be USD 8.5 million using the
market approach. The Group made USD 10.9 million impairment on the investment in Liesheng and the
loss was recognized in other comprehensive income and loss.

As in previous years, these balances were not subject to any utilization restrictions in 2022. However,
the repatriation of funds from Russia is currently only possible to a limited extent.

**16.** **VALUATION PROVISIONS OF INVENTORIES**

The Group periodically reviews its inventories for excess amounts, obsolescence and declines in market
value below cost and records an allowance against the inventory balance for any such declines. These reviews
require management to estimate future demand for products. If the future demand for Group’s products
was weaker than anticipated or the market conditions deteriorated, the value of inventories would likely have
to be written down.

In 2022 management conducted an intensive review of our estimate of net realizable value of the
inventories in response to an adjustment of the distribution strategy. With more focus on the self-operated
distribution channels, the Group is able to dispose the out-of-season products more efficiently. Based on
extensive investigation, management revised the estimate correspondingly. This change in estimate resulted
in a reduction in the inventory provision by approximately USD 10.9 million recorded in cost of goods sold.

Carrying amounts of current financial instruments carried at amortized cost are reasonable
approximation of fair value due to their short-term nature. Carrying amounts of loans from financial
institutions, loans from related parties, and other interest-bearing liabilities approximate their fair values
because the loans are at floating rate.

Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market
prices at the end of the reporting period. The Group does not have any financial instrument included in
level 1.

Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. over-thecounter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market
data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an
instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities.

The Group’s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of
the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements
during the fiscal years.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

   - for interest rate swaps—the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable
yield curves

   - for foreign currency forwards—the present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange
rates at the consolidated statement of financial position, and

   - for other financial instruments—discounted cash flow analysis.


-----

All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2, except for unlisted equity securities,
promissory notes and available for sale factoring receivables, where the fair values have been determined
based on present values and the discount rates used were adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk. In cases
where credit risk of counterparty is low and maturity is short-term, the carrying amount of such instrument
approximates its fair value.

The following table show the valuation technique used in measuring level 3 fair values for financial
instruments in the consolidated statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable
inputs used.

**Type** **Valuation technique** **Significant unobservable input**


Unlisted equity securities Market comparison approach:
fair value of unlisted equity
securities is determined by
reference to market multiples of
comparable listed companies,
adjusted by discount for lack of
marketability.

Promissory notes The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these
instruments and low credit risk of
counterparty.

Available for sale factoring The carrying amount
receivables approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these
instruments and low credit risk of
counterparty.


(i) Sales growth factor

(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate

The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these
instruments and low credit risk of
counterparty.

The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these
instruments and low credit risk of
counterparty.


As of each reporting year end, the Group analyses the level 3 fair values and performs an assessment of
the movements, if any. The Group may engage external valuation experts to perform valuation on the level 3
fair value if the amount involved is significant or the valuation process requires significant judgement. For
example, the Group engaged external valuation experts to perform valuation on its investment in Liesheng in
2022.

**28.** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

Amer Sports, Inc. is exposed to customary financial risks such as commodity price risks, inflation risks,
funding and liquidity risks, foreign exchange and interest rate risks, counterparty and credit risks.

**COMMODITY PRICE RISK**

Amer Sports is exposed to commodity and other price risk, including from rubber, nylon, polyester
and steel, aluminum and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as
fabric, as well as other inputs, including energy, transportation and logistics services. To manage risks of
commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. Amer Sports has not
historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.

**INFLATION RISK**

Inflationary pressures have recently increased, and may continue to increase, the costs of labor, raw
materials and other inputs for Amer Sports’ products. Amer Sports has experienced, and may continue to
experience, higher than expected inflation, including escalating transportation, commodity and other supply
chain costs and disruptions. If our costs are subject to significant inflationary pressures, Amer Sports may
not be able to offset such higher costs through price increases, which could adversely affect its business, results
of operations or financial condition.

Funding and liquidity risks, foreign exchange and interest rate risks, counterparty, and credit risks are
managed by Amer Sports Treasury, which acts as an in-house bank providing financial services for subsidiaries
within the Amer Sports Group. The Treasury related operational risk management is governed by the
Group’s Treasury Policy which includes principles and risk limits. Amer Sports Treasury follows and monitors
operational risks constantly and does not allow any material deviations from the Treasury Policy.

As a consequence of the Group’s ownership change, the Senior Facilities Agreement signed on March 20,
2019, is a cornerstone of Amer Sports’ funding and hence provides both options and limitations to activities
that relate to funding and liquidity management. The agreement has been signed by financing banks,
Amer Sports Holding 1 Oy (former Mascot Midco 1 Oy) as the parent and Amer Sports Holding Oy (former
Mascot Bidco Oy) as the Company.

Under the historical ownership structure, the general availability of funding and liquidity including the
management of the related risks was arranged in close co-operation with the parent company.

**FUNDING RISK**

Funding risk is the risk that Amer Sports, Inc. will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet
commitments associated with existing financial instruments.

In 2022, 2021 and 2020 Amer Sports, Inc.’s subsidiaries incurred financial commitments, as described
below.

In 2020, Amer Sports Holding 1 Oy’s subsidiary Amer Sports Holding Oy borrowed one new term
loan under the Senior Facilities Agreement in the amount of EUR 100 million. The proceeds of the loan
were distributed equally to Amer Sports Company and Amer Sports Canada Inc., Arc’teryx division with the
purpose to replace the entities’ internal funding with Amer Sports Oy with external funding.

In February 2021, Amer Sports European Center AG incurred a USD 35 million short-term loan to
finance Amer Sports Group’s payments to certain vendors in Asia.

In April 2021, Amer Sports Company and Amer Sports Canada Inc., Arc’teryx division repaid the
EUR 100 million term loan raised in 2020 in full prior to maturity.

In 2022, no new external financing arrangements were finalized. However, Amer Sports European
Center AG’s USD 35 million short-term loan was extended by 12 months.


-----

In 2022, minority share investors invested equity and debt through the related party entity Amer
Sports Amer Sports Management Company (Cayman) Limited. The invested debt was EUR 10.5 million,
pays floating rate interest and matures in 2029.

**LIQUIDITY RISK**

At an operational level, the Group’s liquidity risks revolve around its cyclical need for working capital
and such expenses are a significant factor in shaping its overall liquidity strategy. Typically, the highest level
of working capital has been reached in the third quarter, when short-term debt is tied up in inventories
and accounts receivable.

The term loan B was fully drawn in 2019 and no prepayment was done until end of 2022.

A USD 336 million (EUR 315 million) revolving credit facility limit is part of the Senior Facilities
Agreement and is intended to assist with Amer Sports’ short-term liquidity needs.

Amer Sports Treasury has established several cash pooling structures with the Group’s relationship
banks in order to manage the liquidity of the Group. Treasury Policy sets guidelines for the management of
liquidity that is outside cash pooling structures.

Liquidity in excess of operating needs may be invested inline with the Treasury Policy and the Senior
Facilities Agreement.

derivatives in their contractual maturities.

(3) The statement of financial position values of the derivatives have been recorded as they are disclosed in
the Group’s statement of financial position and fair value reserve, and therefore cannot be reconciled
with their actual fair values.

**CURRENCY RISK**

Transaction risk arises from foreign currency denominated receivables and liabilities, cash flows in
foreign currencies and derivatives. Translation risk relates to the foreign currency denominated earnings
when they are translated into USD. Amer Sports has operations in most of the major currency areas, and
its sales are diversified in multiple currencies. On the business unit level, transaction risk arises when the unit
sells in its home currency but the cost base is in foreign currencies or sells or buys goods in foreign currencies.
Amer Sports’ risk management is aiming to eliminate material uncertainties relating to foreign exchange
rates.

At the end of the year, Amer Sports’ currency position consisted of intercompany and external interestfree and interest-bearing foreign currency denominated receivables and liabilities and foreign exchange
derivatives. Foreign exchange derivatives include both balance sheet and cash flow hedges.

Balance sheet risks have been managed by financing Amer Sports’ subsidiaries in their functional
currencies. The risks have been concentrated on the centralized distribution and purchasing units that
invoice the subsidiaries in their respective functional currencies. Amer Sports’ risk for the consolidated
statement of financial position arises from internal and external liabilities in foreign currencies.

The following table sets out the foreign exchange positions in the most significant currencies at the
reporting date:

Earnings sensitivity before taxes is influenced by changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not
used in hedge accounting and on-balance hedging derivative instruments as well as changes in the value of onbalance currency-denominated loans and receivables. Shareholders’ equity (deficit) is mainly affected by
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in hedge accounting recognized under the hedge
reserve.

According to Amer Sports’ hedging policy, the transaction risk arising from subsidiaries’ business
operations is hedged between 12–24 months. In practice, the hedge ratios are higher for closer months than
for later months. The hedge ratio is maintained between 55% and 95% of 24 months cash flow, except in
currencies with high interest rate where the hedge horizon is 12–18 months. Hedge ratios are monitored
daily. The hedged cash flow is expected to be realized during the following 12–24 months. Amer Sports hedges
only annual cash flows or other exposures with a value of over EUR 5.0 million. Amer Sports temporarily
shortened the hedging horizon to 12 months and in 2022 has managed to reach longer tenors again, but not
yet in the extent of the Treasury Policy.

Amer Sports applies hedge accounting to the forecasted sales or purchases in foreign currencies related
to its operating activities for cash flows with a counter value of over EUR 10 million per currency pair in
the entity. The effectiveness is assessed quarterly by analysing the critical terms. The critical terms of the
hedging instrument and the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. The forecasted hedged
transactions are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedging instrument,
and therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed
by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged
transactions have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no
such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective.
Sources of ineffectiveness, including timing differences in the settlement of forecasted hedged transactions
and hedging instruments, and changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments, are not considered material.

Foreign exchange differences of foreign exchange derivatives are recognized as hedging reserve while
interest rate differentials related to the foreign exchange derivatives are recorded through the consolidated
statement of loss.

According to its Treasury Policy, Amer Sports may hedge 0 to 50% of subsidiaries’ equity. At the end
of 2022, 2021 and 2020 there were no outstanding equity hedges or net investment hedges.

**INTEREST RISK**

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk when it funds its group operations with external debt. The
risk arises from the repricing of floating rate debt and with the raising of new floating rate debt. A fixed rate
debt is subject to “fair value risk”. The purpose of interest rate risk management is to bring predictability
for interest expenses. Amer Sports Treasury may hedge the outstanding or forthcoming interest rate position
of Amer Sports Group by using interest rate derivatives defined in the Treasury Policy.

The duration of the loans in Amer Sports, Inc. was 1 month in 2022, 3 months in 2021 and 4 months
in 2020. 2% of the debt portfolio was at fixed rate as of December, 2022, 2% in 2021 and 2% in 2020.

Cash and cash equivalents are excluded from the interest rate risk portfolio of the group due to their
short-term nature.

The sensitivity of the consolidated statement of loss contains changes in interest expenses for the next
12 months due to an increase/decrease of 1% in market interest rates, provided that other factors remain
unchanged.

The below table illustrates the sensitivity of the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity and the
consolidated statement of loss to an increase of 1% in interest rates, provided that other factors remain
unchanged. The sensitivity is calculated to interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate floors are excluded from
the calculations.

The effective interest rate of the debt used for financing was 4.0% in 2022, 4.2% in 2021 and 3.9% in
2020. The effective interest rate is calculated by taking into account interest expenses, financing expenses
and derivatives’ expenses.

The average interest rate of the Group’s interest-bearing debt was 4.0% in 2022, 3.6% in 2021 and 3.7%
in 2020.

The Group has outstanding non-hedge accounting related interest rate derivatives. The derivates used
to hedge floating rate loans that have been repaid. Although the original loans were repaid, it was decided
to maintain these derivatives as a protection against interest rate risks related to the new funding.

The expected impact from interest rate benchmark reform concerning IBOR reference rates replacement
is considered to be limited for Amer Sports, since the majority of the Group’s external contracts are tied to
EURIBOR reference rates. Amer Sports’ IBOR exposure is mainly related to USD LIBOR linked external
short term loans and funding that amounted to USD 155 million as of December 31, 2022 and have yet to
transition to an alternative benchmark rate. USD LIBOR publication will be ceased after June 2023.

**CREDIT RISK**

Amer Sports, Inc. is exposed to customary credit risk through accounts receivables that are held in the
Company’s consolidated statement of financial position. The Company has a global customer base, and
there are no significant risk concentrations. The largest single customer accounts for 4% of total accounts
receivable and the largest 20 combined total about 31%. At the end of year 2022 the average payment time for
the outstanding sales was 53 days.

Amer Sports uses credit insurance in most of the countries in EMEA and Japan to protect against the
risk of non-payment and to secure sales up to predefined limits.

Excess liquidity can be placed to the market according to the Treasury Policy’s and the Senior Facilities
Agreement’s credit criteria and limits.

The credit risk arising from Amer Sports’ derivatives is considered low. The risk is minimized by
careful selection of counterparties, their limited share of the total portfolio and by monitoring counterparties’
creditworthiness and outstanding liabilities towards Amer Sports.

**Factoring**

A subsidiary of the Group entered into a factoring agreement, originally in 2013 and subsequently
amended and restated in 2022, with a third-party banking institution (“Factor”), pursuant to which the
Group agreed to sell accounts receivable up to a limit of USD 50 million in exchange for advanced funding
equal to 100% of the principal value of the invoice on a non-recourse basis. Information on accounts receivable
identified for factoring are provided and verified by the Factor prior to being accepted for factoring. The
Group is charged a fee of commission of 0.4% on the basis of purchased gross invoice amount, and an
adjustment rate of the Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.50% per annum, based on the number of days between the
purchase date and the settlement date. The program is in place for certain approved US based obligors.

Amer Sports uses sale of receivables with the purpose to balance liquidity swings of the Group. The
year-end value of uncollected receivables transferred as part of the factoring program was USD 34.6 million
as of December 31, 2022, USD 0 million as of December 31, 2021 and USD 0.1 million as of January 1,
2021. As of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, the total accounts receivable
balances transferred to the Factor amounted to USD 116.2 million, USD 0 million and USD 117.2 million,
respectively.

The Group has assessed that significantly all risks and rewards of the transferred accounts receivables
have been transferred to the Factor. The Group only retains the risk of late payments of the underlying
debtors, which has been considered immaterial for the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of
the continuing involvement in the transferred trade receivables amounted to USD 0.5 million as of
December 31, 2022, which corresponds to the maximum payment and the undiscounted cash outflows the
Group might have to pay in case of late payment. All of the potential cash outflows have a maturity of less
than 12 months.

required, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to allocate assets and liabilities, including
goodwill, between the two cash generating units in 2023.

b) The Board approved the Employee Stock Ownership Plan 2023 (“ESOP 2023”) in 2023. The

Group. The ESOP 2023 provides for awards in the form of stock options to the Group’s key
employees. The maximum number of options that may be granted is 1.2% of all of the Groups’s
issued and outstanding shares. Subject to a participant’s continued employment, options granted
under the ESOP 2023 will vest upon satisfaction of vesting conditions set out in an award agreement.

EUR 23.60 per share under ESOP 2019 and 1,012,790 options were granted at a weighted average
