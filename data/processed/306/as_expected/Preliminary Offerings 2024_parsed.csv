306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1054,CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,1054.2,Financial Statements,1054.2.1,,"Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information contained in this offering memorandum is prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Certain differences exist between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which might be material to the financial information herein. We have not prepared a reconciliation of our consolidated financial statements and related footnote disclosures between IFRS and U.S. GAAP. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how these differences might affect the financial information herein. The audited consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been restated due to certain changes in accounting principles, classification and corrections of errors from previously published audited consolidated financial statements. For further information on the restatements of our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 3, “Changes in accounting principles and correction of errors,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our financial information should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1054,CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,1054.3,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,1054.3.1,,"We use constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-IFRS financial measures, in this offering memorandum. A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure. We calculate constant currency revenue by translating the current period reported amounts using the actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior period, in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period. EBITDA is calculated as net loss plus income tax expense, finance cost, depreciation and amortization and minus finance income, from both continuing and discontinued operations. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA with adjustments to exclude results from discontinued operations, restructuring expenses, impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets, expenses related to transaction activities, expenses related to certain legal proceedings and share-based payments. We calculated Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA less the right-of-use asset amortization expense under IFRS 16. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We believe that constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal ----- comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. You should not consider constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under IFRS. Constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and have limitations as an analytical tool. For example, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude certain tax payments that may reduce cash available to us, do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future, do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs and do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. Additionally, our calculations of constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may be different from the calculations used by other companies for similarly titled measures, including our competitors, and therefore may not be comparable to those of other companies. For reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” and for a reconciliation of Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, see “Summary Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” Furthermore, investors should note that “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA”, as defined in the “Description of Notes” and the indenture governing the notes, is not calculated in the same manner as Adjusted EBITDA or PreIFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

While the sports and outdoor industry connects us with nature, we also understand it can consume our planet’s precious resources. Together with our brands, we are focused on managing the complex and challenging supply chains in our industry to build a sustainability culture that positively impacts our environment and the people whose lives we touch. As a participant of the UN Global Compact, Amer Sports Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, aims to incorporate the Ten Principles of the Global Compact and to support applicable UN Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, we have committed to set science-based near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets at the group level, which we intend to submit to be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). At the brand level, we are focused on sustainable business practices. For example, Arc’teryx opened five new ReBird™ Service Centers in the United States, Canada, Greater China and Japan. ReBird™ Service Centers offer consumers complementary repair services for their Arc’teryx gear, connecting consumers to the brand’s ongoing focus on improving circularity, including upcycling, resale, care and repair. Arc’teryx’s sustainability program, ReCare™, provides consumers with information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform. Salomon and Peak Performance have reduced the need for materials and transport by using 3D product samples for sales purposes and are looking to expand the use of 3D in consumer experiences and e-commerce. Further, Arc’teryx and Salomon have each set brand-level near-term science-based emission reduction targets for 2030 approved by the SBTi. ----- Our management oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy.

Working groups plan and execute roadmaps on sustainability initiatives in key areas identified, such as climate change, circular economy, responsible procurement and supply chain, human rights, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also take our responsibility for the health and well-being of our own employees as well as the employees of our partners along the value chain seriously.

We mobilize global resources of the Amer Sports platform to support our brands to create a differentiated and powerful growth engine. Since our transition to our new group structure and operating model, our brands have demonstrated strong momentum and accelerated growth.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Transformation,9.3.2,Elevated Brand Positioning,"In 2019, we conducted consumer insight studies to enhance our brands’ understanding of their target consumer demographics across key geographies. We expect our target consumers to be highly focused on technical performance and premium quality, and to aspire to own and utilize the best products regardless of whether engaging in sporting activities or navigating everyday routines. We continue to advance our products to meet our consumers’ needs, while enhancing our marketing strategies to clarify the premium brand positioning and drive a deeper emotional connection with consumers. We leverage creative product marketing, rich digital content, brand ambassadors and community building activities centered around the brands to create an authentic connection with the consumer that has resulted in stronger brand advocacy and loyalty. As our brands continue to grow, we will need to balance the risk of brand dilution with greater brand awareness, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, harm to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain consumers and wholesale partners, employees, brand ambassadors, partners and other stakeholders.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Transformation,9.3.3,Strategic Transformation of the Go-to-Market Strategy,"Through our brand-direct model, we have developed a better understanding of each brand’s target consumers, which has allowed us to elevate brand positioning and customize each brand’s go-to-market strategies to develop ----- deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers. These tailored go-to- market strategies are designed to effectively reach target consumers and drive traffic and conversion. For example, Arc’teryx is aligned with a DTC channel strategy because of its technical apparel product portfolio where it can leverage a retail store base to deliver an immersive experience to consumers. Salomon and Wilson are historically wholesale driven businesses but have an equally strong drive to connect with consumers directly. Both brands have recently increased their presence within the DTC channel while enhancing their wholesale partnerships to further brand equity and drive growth. Across our three core brands, our global owned retail network includes 138 Arc’teryx owned retail stores, 114 Salomon owned retail stores and nine Wilson owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Transformation,9.3.4,Accelerated Brand Penetration in Greater China,"We have leveraged key learnings from our long-term oriented owners to enhance our capabilities and performance in Greater China. As a result, we have grown our Greater China business significantly at a time when others were facing challenges or retrenching. We now have a deep understanding of the average consumer in Greater China and are able to deliver authentic, technical and premium products that align with consumer preferences. Our retail knowhow, including our ability to deliver a high-end, luxury oriented in- store presentation and execution capabilities have been upgraded significantly, allowing us to quickly identify and secure highly attractive store locations with desirable consumer foot traffic. For example, we have 63 Arc’teryx owned retail stores in Greater China as of September 30, 2023. The stores combined with our brand connects well with both pure outdoor adventurers and luxury consumers in Greater China. We also have 30 Salomon owned retail stores and a total of 67 Salomon distribution points (including owned retail stores and partner stores) in Greater China as of September 30, 2023, up from 13 in 2019. For Wilson, we recently became the exclusive NBA provider and licensee of basketballs, which is driving growth in the region, and the rapid adoption of winter sports in Greater China is driving Salomon and Atomic winter equipment sales. Our execution in Greater China has successfully increased our percentage of total revenue derived from the region from 8.3% in 2020 to 14.8%, or $523.8 million, in 2022, and up to 19.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and we believe there is significant runway for growth in the region as we continue to roll- out retail locations across our brands and scale our e-commerce platform.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Haselden to lead Arc’teryx and Peak Performance. Mr. Haselden has experience with fast growing brands having previously served as the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer at Lululemon Athletica as well other senior executive roles at brands such as J.Crew. We appointed Franco Fogliato to lead Salomon. Mr. Fogliato has extensive outdoor experience with large global portfolios, having previously served as an Executive Vice President of Global Omnichannel at Columbia Sportswear with additional experience at The North Face and Billabong. We promoted Joseph Dudy to lead Wilson. Mr. Dudy has worked at Wilson for more than 28 years and has a deep understanding of the brand having previously served as Wilson’s Chief Financial Officer. Under his leadership, Wilson has experienced strong growth in racquet sports, including new racquet categories such as padel and pickleball, won a contract with the NBA to once again be its exclusive basketball provider and licensee, and deepened its relationship with the NFL. Lastly, we appointed John Yao as General Manager of Amer Sports Greater China to closely coordinate brand success with global teams in this important region. John previously helped lead Nike’s business in Greater China for over 17 years. ----- In addition to resetting our leaderships teams, we have made considerable investments to attract top- tier industry talent across the Amer Sports group.

Our brands are defined by innovative, excellent products with superior quality, sustainability and thoughtful design, enabling them to be “market shapers” and leaders in intensely competitive markets for products, services and experiences. For example, Arc’teryx produces specialty climbing and mountain apparel worn from the foot to the peak of the Canadian Rockies, Salomon attracts the best athletes with its footwear and winter sports equipment from the French Alps to trails across the world and Wilson Sporting Goods is a market leader for tennis equipment, baseball gloves, baseball and softball bats, basketballs and footballs. With multiple brands that are market leaders in their respective categories, we have a diversified, resilient portfolio. The consistency and profitability of our hard goods categories are complemented by multiple forward growth levers, including double digit, profitable growth in soft goods across large markets. As a group, our brands are complementary to one another while also geographically and seasonally diversified. We serve a wide range of global athletic and outdoor activities year-round. The relationship among our brands positions us to outfit the outdoor athlete from head to toe. For example, an outdoor athlete can ski on Atomic in the winter, wear an Arc’teryx jacket when rock climbing in the fall and run with Salomon shoes year round. Our market leadership in numerous categories, combined with the diversification of our portfolio, allows us to serve consumers around the world at all times of the year and reduces the aggregate level of seasonality across our business. Nevertheless, changes in market trends and consumer preferences could adversely affect our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Competitive Strengths,9.5.2,Authentic Brand Connection with Consumers across Performance Levels,"We believe our brands are individually and collectively genuine, true to the aligned group and brand values and purposeful in delivering on promises to our communities. The authenticity of our brands connects us to sports and outdoor enthusiasts who associate our brands with quality craftsmanship, leading innovation and a passion for athletics and the outdoors. An Arc’teryx consumer sees a high-end climbing and ski brand while a Wilson consumer sees it as a leader in tennis. Our credibility is supported by strong brand heritage along with professional athletes across sports leagues and activities choosing to use our brands’ products. At the same time, our products fit and appeal to consumers of all skill levels. This genuine brand equity helps us drive attention and traffic to our brands, with everyday consumers seeking to align themselves with the carefully crafted brand images we have curated over time. Core to the identity of each of our brands is our mission to enhance consumer experiences. In doing so, our brands foster a sense of belonging. We create thriving communities that are passionate about the sports and activities we support and are loyal to our brands. Arc’teryx hosts community events at retail locations and in the outdoors that bring thousands of people together in an authentic way. At ski resorts globally, Salomon, Atomic, Armada and Arc’teryx brand awareness grows naturally as millions of outdoor enthusiasts see some of the most skilled athletes using our brands. We believe the authenticity of our brands attracts consumers, drives brand affinity and builds a growing loyal following.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Competitive Strengths,9.5.3,Performance Products Driven by Consumer-Focused Innovation,"Our products are rooted in innovation and technical excellence, and set the standard for quality, function and style across their respective categories. Through a consumer-focused, design-led mindset, we emphasize understanding and meeting the evolving needs and demands of athletes and consumers. Our innovation processes are institutionalized through continued investment in research and development at our innovation centers. These include the Wilson Innovation Center in Chicago, Arc’teryx design centers in North Vancouver, Portland and Tokyo and Salomon’s Annecy Design Center in France. Our teams are constantly testing new ideas to improve our current offering and to be the first to commercialize new products, while balancing the potential lack of receptivity of new products, as well as shifting consumer preferences. ----- Our brands are supported by former competitive athletes who enjoy an active lifestyle and have a desire to lean into hard problems and apply design to create possibility. We have an expansive network of hundreds of professional athletes and ambassadors across our brands who we actively collaborate with. We gather feedback, insights and ideas from them to incorporate into our designs. This direct feedback drives our product innovation engine and results in high-end products that are trusted by our consumers. We leverage advanced technologies to constantly improve our products and reaffirm the pricing power our brands command. For example, Wilson has driven innovation across sports including football, baseball, tennis and golf for over a century. Today, that culture of innovation is present in each of our brands as we are using artificial intelligence to design a baseball bat with a larger sweet spot, we have used 3D printing to create an airless basketball, and we use sensors and cameras on skiers to improve ski edge designs. Design features across our brands include Arc’teryx and Salomon developing new, greener membranes with Gore-Tex for their jackets and shoes, improving the waterproofing and breathability, Salomon’s patented Sensifit footwear technology providing precise and comfortable fit in combination with the differentiated Quicklace system and Wilson’s cushion core carcass in its basketballs designed to ensure an easy grip for players. In recent years, design teams at our brands have also invested in the development of products, packaging and services with a sustainability focus, such as Wilson’s Triniti™ tennis balls made of certain materials that enhance product longevity and using recyclable packaging and Salomon’s MTN Summit alpine boot with ecodesigned features. Our products’ shape their respective categories with innovative technologies fueled by our deep commitment to rigorous research and development.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Competitive Strengths,9.5.4,Global Market Access with Scale and Global Points of Presence,"Collectively, we are a scaled global business with diverse geographic reach and distribution. In 2022, 42% of our revenue was from the Americas, 36% from EMEA, 7% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 15% from Greater China. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 40% of our revenue was from the Americas, 33% from EMEA, 8% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 19% from Greater China. All around the globe, our brands are guided by a consumer-first mindset and meet consumers exactly where they shop, in both digital and physical spaces. Each brand boasts a multi-channel distribution strategy that is tailored to the brand’s product assortment. For example, Salomon has strong access to key specialty retailers in remote mountain locations where consumers buy trail running and winter sports equipment, where the customer base differs significantly from sporting good chains. Arc’teryx is oriented towards a DTC model with next generation retail locations that illuminate the brand identity and resonate with consumers, tailored to consumer preferences by region. As a group, we deploy a vertically integrated, DTC mindset, while leveraging our network of strong wholesale relationships. We are increasingly emphasizing our owned e-commerce and building out our owned retail distribution around the world. As of September 30, 2023, we have over 330 owned retail stores and growing. Our owned retail stores serve as attractive marketing tools that elevate the consumer experience, and, with the help of instore activations and events, enhance brand loyalty, build communities and generate a strong return-on-investment. Our owned retail benefits our global e-commerce business, which has grown significantly across all brands, up 88% from 2020 to 2022. The combination of our wholesale and DTC channels, along with our global infrastructure allow our brands to connect with consumers conveniently and seamlessly around the world. While our business and revenues are geographically diverse, this is the aggregate result of an extensive global footprint built and expanded at the local level and fostered over decades. Today we have owned retail stores in 24 countries representing generations of investment in local communities, which allows us the flexibility to tailor our approach to best meet the needs of local markets. We are nimble across markets and able to replicate success of new product launches in one region globally in a short period of time given our investments in our growing worldwide network.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Competitive Strengths,9.5.5,Differentiated Operating Model Supporting Our Brands,"Our global platform supports the brands in key functional areas such as financial controls, capital allocation, compliance and sustainability. IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, vendor administration and communication functions are areas in which we seek to ensure the ongoing protection of shared assets. We also serve the brands in areas such as human resources, financial reporting, automation and continuous technological improvement. Across these functional areas, our brands benefit from infrastructure that they would not be able to build cost efficiently as stand ----- alone entities. The scale advantages of our platform can be observed in the over $1.4 billion in annual procurement spend we undertake across 176 suppliers in 32 countries as well as 19 distribution centers, of which we operate 9, globally as of September 30, 2023. In essence, our brands enjoy the benefits of access to a high-quality global supply chain commensurate with a greater than $3 billion revenue platform. The shared resources not only create synergies for the brands across each of our segments, but also empower them to prioritize and optimize brand strategy and performance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Competitive Strengths,9.5.6,Proven Ability to Win in Greater China,"Since 2018, our capabilities in Greater China have expanded as our group headcount in the region has increased from approximately 450 to 800 employees as of September 30, 2023. We have realized significant success in the region through a commercialization strategy specific to the Chinese market. Our leaders are empowered to make decisions quickly so that we can compete to win in a dynamic and evolving Chinese retail landscape. While the brand experience for consumers is consistent with each brand’s global ethos, we employ localization strategies that resonate with Chinese consumers. For example, Arc’teryx’s loyalty program includes over 1.7 million members in Greater China as of September 30, 2023, having grown from only fourteen thousand in 2018 due to the brand’s ability to leverage tools such as WeChat to accelerate loyalty member enrollment. Our strategy in Greater China also leverages a precise retail rollout combined with operational excellence. Store locations are selected using detailed data analysis, and we are keenly focused on optimizing store size and storelevel productivity. Each location seeks to bring to life our authentic brand stories. Our operational excellence allows us to refresh retail inventory on a regular cadence, helping to drive consistent traffic and excitement in our stores and facilitating a luxury experience. We have already demonstrated success in Greater China, having grown our revenue from $202.3 million in 2020 to $523.8 million in 2022, representing a 60.9% CAGR, and operating margins in the region exceeds the margins of the business overall. Our revenue from Greater China has continued to grow in 2023, with $593.0 million revenue derived from the region for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, up from $353.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing a growth rate of 67.6%. In addition, while our initial success in Greater China was largely related to growth of Arc’teryx, we have developed a repeatable playbook with Salomon, which grew its revenue in Greater China by 72% from 2021 to 2022. We believe we are in the preliminary stages of addressing our growth opportunity in Greater China as our brands continue to be recognized and appreciated by consumers in Greater China, while our proven ability to tailor and execute a regional strategy highlights our global potential.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

At the brand level, we have a deep bench of leaders that have significant experience building DTC retail strategies and unrivaled expertise in accessing fast growing markets. Our brand CEOs operate with a high degree of autonomy and support from group management. Within each brand organization, we have highly talented individuals executing key functionalities, including brand marketing, product development and operations.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Growth Strategies,9.6.1,Leverage Innovation Leadership to Strengthen Core Categories and Scale Newer Categories,"The foundation of our brands’ success comes from an ability to innovate and create products that appeal to both elite athletes and everyday consumers. We believe our innovation model, which has been institutionalized across ----- brands in each of our three segments, will allow us to expand our market shares within core categories, as well as tactically scale in newer categories. Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx employs a hands-on, iterative product development process that begins with innovative ideas in the North Vancouver design center. These product innovations come to life via on-site prototyping at the nearby ARC’One facility. Further, the team rigorously tests the product in the Canadian Coast Mountains with world-class mountain athletes. This results in a product that meets our  high quality standards and drives continuous innovation. Core innovation enables products like the Alpha SV waterproof breathable “hardshell” jacket to consistently be among Arc’teryx’s top selling products, supporting the brand’s market leadership within outdoor technical apparel and driving continued topline growth. Along with core outdoor category growth, Arc’teryx plans to grow its women’s category, where it has invested in new design leadership, including an expanded assortment, color palette and updated fits, along with rigorous engagement with female athletes to further expand market share with female consumers. For new product development, Arc’teryx recently opened a footwear development office in Portland, Oregon to be able to provide a more comprehensive offering to the outdoor consumer, while also further diversifying product line seasonality. Arc’teryx is also expanding its product portfolio through its popular contemporary urban lifestyle line, Veilance. These new categories are supplemented by sustainability programs, including ReCare™, ReCut™ and ReGear™. ReCare™ provides consumers with information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform. Within Outdoor Performance, Salomon is deeply committed to innovation in footwear, reflected by its worldclass design center in Annecy, France, along with a professional athlete collaboration program to design nextgeneration products. Through trail running, Salomon has been influential in shaping the modern outdoor footwear industry, rich in heritage of the French Alps. These innovations fuel the future of the sport, recently being worn by Courtney Dauwalter as she set back-to-back records at the Western States Endurance Race 100-mile run, and three weeks later, in the Hardrock 100 with the same pair of S/LAB Genesis shoes. S/LAB is the brand’s halo collection of specialty running and Nordic ski systems which have won races from the UTMB in Chamonix France to the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, China. The brand’s ADDIKT PRO on-piste ski line is made with recycled ABS sidewalls, demonstrating Salomon’s leading innovation. Historically, innovation has supported the evolution of Salomon’s iconic products like the XT-6, which was launched in 2013 and originally designed for ultra-distance trail runners under harsh conditions. This silhouette now creates the foundation of Salomon’s rapidly growing Sportstyle line, which creates a blend between function and fashion that is loved by athletes and consumers alike and represents a significant opportunity for the brand. Salomon Sportstyle footwear has become so culturally relevant that the MM6 Maison Margiela x Salomon Cross Low shoes have been worn by global superstars, including during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show, which was viewed by more than 115 million people globally. Sportstyle is the fastest growing collection in the Salomon brand with revenue over $80 million in 2022, and over $165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salomon also demonstrates an unwavering commitment to producing high-quality equipment for winter sports. During the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, athletes using Salomon products went on to win 28 Olympic medals, showcasing the technical excellence of the brand’s winter sports equipment from skis, ski boots, ski bindings, snowboards, snowboard boots and bindings. Two-time World Cup Overall Alpine ski racer Marco Odermatt has relied exclusively on Salomon ski boots and bindings in his wins. Salomon intends to continue leveraging its premier innovation capabilities to improve existing product lines as well as develop new products to drive growth and increase market share. In Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson’s in-house innovation capabilities, anchored by its innovation center located in Chicago, provide a competitive advantage and an engine for continuous growth. The brand’s significant scale, particularly compared to mono-sport competitors, allows Wilson to make significant investments in research and development. The innovation process leverages key insights from technical scientists, engineers and designers who ----- have a deep understanding of sports and the technical needs of athletes who use Wilson products. For example, as of September 1, 2023, 27% of the top 100 men’s tennis players and 42% of the top 100 women’s players in the world use Wilson rackets. Other recent innovation examples include a Louisville Slugger baseball bat that uses simulation software combined with artificial intelligence, first utilized in the golf space and then expanded to baseball, to enhance the contact sweet spot, or the Evo NXT basketball that redistributes the weight of the ball with an advanced internal construction, making the ball easier to shoot from long range. New product introductions accounted for approximately 21% to 22% of revenue each year from 2020 to 2022 for Wilson, and accounted for approximately 21% of the brand’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These product innovations drive market share growth in core sports as well as adjacent categories such as the increasingly popular games of padel in Europe and pickleball in the United States. As a new growth lever, Wilson is expanding its reach in soft goods categories in addition to sports equipment. Wilson is already experiencing success with its Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy, which involves launching tennis footwear and increasing exposure to apparel and represented 3.7% of total Wilson sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 5.1% of total Wilson sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We believe this category will continue to grow as a larger contributor to the Wilson business and help fuel broader brand engagement. Across segments, our plans to innovate, expand our product offering and successfully implement our growth strategy may not be successful, and implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Growth Strategies,9.6.2,Further Penetrate Key Markets and Strategically Broaden Our Geographic Footprint,"While our brands across each of our three segments have achieved global recognition, there are specific markets where they enjoy greater prominence: Arc’teryx in North America and Greater China, Salomon in Europe and Wilson in North America. By capitalizing on our existing global presence and leveraging our brands’ strengths, we have a significant opportunity to strategically increase our presence in existing and new geographies by cultivating new customer bases where there is promising market demand and ample room for growth. Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx’s future geographic growth will be grounded in its historical momentum in North America and Greater China, with considerable opportunity in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. In North America and Greater China, the brand operates 48 and 63 owned retail stores, including seven and 21 factory outlets, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. During the period from 2019 to September 30, 2023, the brand has opened a net total of 30 new stores in Greater China, as well as a net total of 20 new stores in North America, with a net total of three additional stores opened during the fourth quarter of 2023. In Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific, Arc’teryx operates six and 21 owned retail stores, including two and five factory outlets, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. The brand intends to continue developing its retail real estate portfolio in these markets to drive brand awareness and growth. In Europe, there are retail opportunities in large metro areas such as Paris, as well as iconic, outdoor locations across the Alps, including Chamonix, France, Zermatt, Switzerland and St. Anton, Austria, where important community-building “mountain stores” are targeted to create authentic brand positioning. Within Outdoor Performance, while Salomon is relatively well known in Europe, we believe brand awareness is significantly lower in Greater China and the United States. These markets represent strong growth opportunities as the technical performance, innovative design and premium nature of the brand’s products, especially within footwear, align well with consumer preferences in these markets. In Greater China, Salomon has successfully opened 30 owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023 and has plans to accelerate its retail rollout in this market. Despite still emerging brand awareness, Salomon enjoys specialty niche market positioning in the United States, including being well known for its winter sports equipment. According to the Circana/Retail Tracking Service, it is the number two outdoor footwear brand in the United States for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on dollar sales. ----- Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has a compelling opportunity to leverage its reputation for technical excellence in various sports activities, stemming from its historical success in the North American market. Wilson plans to expand its market leadership in North America while driving growth in both Greater China and Europe. In these newer markets, Wilson plans to leverage its partnership with the NBA as well as capitalize on increasing participation in sports and outdoor activities such as tennis. In Greater China, we believe that higher levels of participation in sports by children, young adults and women provide an opportunity to leverage the Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy to drive apparel and footwear growth while also developing a strong brand relationship with a large and dynamic consumer base. In Europe, Wilson plans to leverage its product authority in racquet sports to drive market share gains in padel, which is a popular fast-growing sport in the region. Fast growing sports like padel and pickleball are also fragmented and provide Wilson an opportunity to innovate on currently relatively standardized equipment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Growth Strategies,9.6.3,Optimize Go-to-market Strategies to Conveniently Engage Consumers,"Each of our brands employs a customized go-to-market strategy that is tailored specifically to the brand’s attributes and designed to effectively reach and captivate consumers. We remain committed to further refining and enhancing our go-to-market strategies with the goal of expanding our market presence, fostering customer loyalty and driving growth. Our DTC strategy will continue to require significant investment and management focus and may present risks and challenges, while our wholesale strategy may be impacted by the strength of our relationships with our wholesale partners. Within Technical Apparel, for Arc’teryx, the DTC channel is the primary vehicle to engage consumers and drives both online and offline conversions. The DTC channel allows Arc’teryx to seamlessly leverage grassroots community marketing strategies and provides for a more agile inventory management model focused on consistent flow of fresh product. While Arc’teryx has a selective wholesale footprint that will remain an important element in its distribution strategy, we expect owned retail and e-commerce to continue to enable DTC to be the brand’s fastest growing channel. - _Retail Brand Stores: Elevated brand stores provide a critical space for Arc’teryx to engage directly with consumers, showcase products and build community. Its retail store strategy has evolved to include three differentiated store formats with square footage generally ranging from 1,000–10,000 sq. ft. With multiple store formats, the brand has expanded its retail store network, with a focus on global retail hubs like Shanghai and New York. The brand stores are highly productive with an average global sales per square foot of approximately $1,474 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Brand stores generally have been profitable with a target payback period of 24 months, with actual performance generally exceeding targets based on our global brand store openings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. The ReBird™ Care and Repair centers, incorporated in several new stores opened since 2022, have been an important element of the brand’s immersive store experience, not only to enhance our efforts in improving the circularity and reusability of our products, but also to drive traffic and consumer engagement. - _E-commerce: Arc’teryx’s digital platform is a catalyst for the business across all channels by growing brand awareness and serving as a global “storefront” for products and brand identity. We believe the Arc’teryx e-commerce platform will continue to grow as brand awareness accelerates through brand and community marketing investments, which contribute to Arc’teryx’s ability to adapt its business based on consumer data received from this platform. Within Outdoor Performance, we have optimized Salomon’s go-to-market strategy from a traditional wholesale model to a modern and balanced consumer-centric retail strategy. The strategy is designed to elevate the brand by selectively choosing premium wholesale partners, curating and segmenting the inventory assortment with them, while also reaching more consumers on a direct basis through owned retail and e-commerce and providing engaging consumer experiences. While the channel mix remains primarily wholesale, DTC has grown significantly from 18% of brand revenue in 2020 to 21% in 2022 in an effort to drive penetration globally. ----- - _Direct-to-Consumer: The brand has a strategic retail expansion plan, focusing on the development of multi-sport, experiential store formats in select major global cities, such as Paris and Milan, as well as increasing the number of Sportstyle focused stores in Greater China. For e-commerce, Salomon recently redesigned its website with a vision to inspire, guide and equip new and returning consumers to unleash their potential through mountain sports. We believe the platform provides an immersive and frictionless brand experience which has led to increased traffic and conversion. We expect growth on the e-commerce platform to scale with retail expansion as brand awareness increases and Salomon builds larger brand communities. - _Wholesale: Salomon targets high-quality wholesale partners, including specialty retailers, globally to attract new consumers. The brand collaborates with partners to drive higher per door productivity. Many of the brand’s specialty retailer partners focus directly on Salomon’s core competencies, including product expertise in hiking and trail running. Within outdoor and trail running shoes, Salomon is focused on consolidating the number of accounts and improving productivity. Within the Sportstyle category, Salomon is similarly focused on improving productivity while expanding the number of retail partners carrying the brand’s products. Salomon intends to further increase its number of strategic wholesale accounts in Europe, especially in underpenetrated areas of Western Europe, as well as the United States where Salomon seeks to target top-tier sporting goods retailers. Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson Sporting Goods’ go-to-market strategy revolves around highly productive wholesale relationships complemented by owned retail stores and an e-commerce platform that create excitement around Wilson’s categories and elevate Wilson’s brand. The wholesale channel is pivotal for Wilson as we believe many consumers prefer to shop in stores where expert recommendations are available and can be critical to driving the point-of-sale for sporting goods. Approximately 50% of Wilson’s wholesale revenue in 2022 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 came from differentiated specialty retailers. Through strong wholesale relationships and a complementary DTC strategy, Wilson aims to continue increasing consumer engagement in the appropriate channels. Importantly, while Wilson’s owned store footprint is expected to remain relatively small and targeted, these stores serve as important consumer touchpoints to build engagement with the brand in high-quality, immersive retail environments. - _Wholesale: Wilson’s wholesale channel comprises more than 15,000 wholesale partners globally for the year ended December 31, 2022, balanced between traditional and specialty retailers and smaller pro shops and country clubs. Through internal, specialized sales teams, Wilson closely collaborates with its wholesale partners to deliver a premium and educational consumer experience that drives brand productivity. From 2020 to 2022, Wilson meaningfully increased wholesale productivity with two of its top wholesale partners, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy, each increasing revenue by 101% and 73%, respectively. As Wilson continues to deliver superior products, it intends to continue increasing productivity and shelf space with strategic wholesale partners. - _Direct-to-Consumer: Wilson leverages DTC channels to complement its wholesale strategy by increasing brand awareness and elevating the brand. Wilson has owned retail stores in strategic locations, such as New York City and Chicago, which provide an immersive consumer experience and illuminate Wilson’s leadership across categories. The brand’s retail strategy is complemented by a global e-commerce platform with innovative digital capabilities, such as a direct-to-team baseball offering that leverages Wilson’s dynamic portfolio of brands and connections with baseball academies, clubs and organizations. Overall, we believe DTC will continue to play a critical role in driving traffic and conversion for Wilson in both the DTC and wholesale channels as brand equity and awareness grow.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Growth Strategies,9.6.4,"Grow Brand Awareness, Expand Our Communities and Increase Customer Loyalty","We believe efforts to drive higher levels of brand awareness and increased customer loyalty across key markets are critical for each of our brands to achieve their commercial potential. As such, each brand has developed robust global marketing programs that build on the authenticity of each brand through strategies ranging from “grass roots” ----- local community activities, to large scale global on-mountain events, to sophisticated original content and social media campaigns that leverage digital marketing. Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx has created a reputation of authenticity and an uncompromising standard of excellence. The result has created a passionate, loyal following for the brand. However, Arc’teryx global brand awareness levels are relatively low when compared to more established premium outerwear brands. The brand plans to tactically increase brand awareness and curate more passionate communities through the following global strategies: - _Arc’teryx Academies: Each year, Arc’teryx hosts several global events in some of the most iconic alpine destinations around the world such as Chamonix, France; St. Anton, Austria and Whistler, British Columbia. Each Academy focuses on a different mountain sport discipline and is open to the public. In 2022, these events saw over 17,500 attendees and generated 76.5 million media impressions. - _Store-Driven Events: Arc’teryx’s events enable the brand to connect to the communities surrounding the brand’s stores. These events range from design discussions, music performances, to speaker series hosted both in-store and online. - _Original Content + Digital and Social Media: In 2022, Arc’teryx has produced 15 original content films with talented filmmakers that featured sponsored athletes. These films included examples such as Unfinished Business, a documentary about Greg Hill summiting all 20 peaks of the Spearhead Traverse in one day and Keep It Real, a video on the underground UK bouldering scene that provided original content to enable authentic brand storytelling across social media channels. We believe original content combined with digital marketing strategies will increase Arc’teryx brand awareness globally. Within Outdoor Performance, while the Salomon brand has existed for more than 75 years, we believe there is an opportunity to grow brand awareness globally, particularly in North America and Greater China. To drive brand awareness, Salomon plans to use the following integrated, brand-first marketing strategy to communicate key product stories: - _Television, Digital and Social Media: Using television, digital and social media, Salomon plans to effectively communicate its brand story to a large audience of consumers and form a deeper connection. For example, in 2022, Salomon unveiled the new “Tomorrow is Yours” campaign aimed at inspiring a wider, younger and more diverse audience to connect with the outdoors. We believe this comprehensive global campaign increased brand awareness and perception globally. - _Brand Ambassadors: Professional athletes trust Salomon in the most demanding competitive environments, which is the greatest form of product validation. In total, more than 600 professional athletes across trail running, snowboarding and alpine and Nordic skiing actively use Salomon products. These athletes provide individual product and brand storytelling opportunities to drive awareness. - _Loyalty Program: In 2022, Salomon launched its loyalty program, S/Plus which allows consumers to earn points for each purchase, access exclusive products and receive other members only benefits. The S/Plus program had over 1.2 million members as of December 31, 2022, the first year of its existence, and over 1.5 million members as of September 30, 2023. - _[Original Content: Salomon.tv originated in 2009 as the original branded content platform in sports. As of](https://salomon.tv/) September 30, 2023, more than 245,000 subscribers view 6-10 original and authentic stories per year highlighting athletes, sports, products and community. - _Events: Salomon has developed a leading series of running events in some of the most iconic outdoor destinations around the world called The Golden Trail Series (“GTS”). These events are the only running events in the world designed and developed for a global television audience. In 2023, GTS events will be broadcasted on Eurosport across 53 countries. Salomon plans to further increase spending to add events in ----- Japan and Greater China to complement the United States and European races, entrenching Salomon as the leading global brand powering the sport of trail running. Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has recently elevated its brand through consistent, cohesive brand messaging across sports categories. Today Wilson is thoughtfully balancing product marketing and brand marketing to engage consumers, and it intends to continue growing its brand awareness in key global markets through the following strategies: - _Professional Partnerships: For more than 110 years, Wilson has been and continues to be a part of championship-level performance for some of the world’s best athletes and iconic sports leagues. These endorsements and partnerships serve as a competitive advantage, providing a differentiated opportunity to convey a story around “Play What the Pros Play.” Wilson plans to continue leveraging these partnerships with both professional leagues and young aspiring talent across sport activities to build brand awareness globally. - _Strategic Marketing: Known for product excellence across sport categories, Wilson is establishing a cohesive brand identity that sources and amplifies brand equity from each categories’ leadership and authenticity, effectively shifting from category marketing to brand marketing. Wilson leverages digital marketing, social media platforms, experiential concepts and collaborations with brands such as KITH to deliver authentic brand and product messaging to consumers. The digital marketing strategy combines personalized targeting, engaging content and data-driven optimization to build brand awareness and drive consumer engagement. In 2022, the brand launched a marketing program for everyone to “Live Like an Athlete,” which immediately increased the brand’s social media engagement. Wilson continues to build on this brand momentum through the Wilson Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy and a comprehensive brand campaign delivered in 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The ability for brands to chart their own consumer-centric strategies while leveraging the global scale and capabilities of our platform provides an opportunity for all our brands across each of our three segments to accelerate their growth in a profitable manner. For example, Atomic and Peak Performance have an opportunity to leverage our platform to increase their presence globally. Atomic is a leading player in winter sports as validated through the use of Atomic equipment by some of the world’s best alpine athletes, including Mikaela Shiffrin. We intend to leverage this professional brand halo to capture additional market share in the global winter sports equipment industry and further extend the Atomic brand to apparel and accessories.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Our Market Opportunity,9.7.1,,"Our brands operate across several markets, including the athletic apparel, athletic footwear and sports equipment markets. These are global markets and form a collective market opportunity of approximately $522 billion as of 2022. - _Global Athletic Apparel Market: According to Euromonitor International, the global athletic apparel market represented $220 billion in annual spending in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.4% CAGR through 2027. - _Global Athletic Footwear Market: According to Euromonitor International, the global athletic footwear market represented $152 billion in annual spending in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.8% CAGR through 2027. We believe our global capabilities and presence, especially within Greater China, positions us well to drive growth in the athletic apparel and athletic footwear markets globally. ----- - _Global Sports Equipment Market:  According to Statista, the global sports equipment market, which includes golf, outdoor, racquet, team sports and winter sports, represented $75 billion in annual spend in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR through 2027. We believe the following trends influence the industries within which we operate and how consumers make their purchase decisions: - _Health & Longevity: We believe one of the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is an increased focus on health and longevity, resulting in increased participation in sports across genders, ages and geographies. For example, according to a survey conducted by a third-party research consulting group, approximately 50% of US consumers reported wellness as a top priority in their daily lives in 2022, an increase from 42% in 2020. We believe this increased focus on health and longevity is a trend that will continue and will drive consumers to purchase sports apparel, footwear and equipment to facilitate a healthy lifestyle through sports and outdoor recreation. - _Increased Casualization: There has been a shift towards more casual apparel and footwear options for daily use, a trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. This casualization trend drives the need for products that can offer versatility across of a variety of use cases, whether in the office, or participating in outdoor activities. We believe our premium apparel and footwear products provide the necessary style, comfort and technical performance to allow consumers to seamlessly transition from one activity to the next while feeling confident throughout the day. - _Growth in the Premium Consumer Segment: Our brands target consumers who seek high-quality, premium performance products to help them perform at their best and feel confident on-and-off the court. According to the Credit Suisse 2022 Global Wealth Report, the number of adults globally with a net worth of $100,000 or more, which we define as the premium consumer segment, has increased from 358 million in 2010 to 689 million in 2021, representing a CAGR of 6.1%. We believe our brands and products are positioned as premium products and enable us to capitalize on growth in the number of premium consumers. - _Sustainable Consumption: We believe sustainable consumption is at the forefront of many consumers’ decision whether to engage or transact with a brand. According to a recent third-party survey of U.S. consumers, sustainability is increasingly influencing consumer behavior. We believe the consumer’s focus on sustainable consumption will be a continued trend and that consumers will seek out sustainability minded companies when making purchases.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Revenue increased across all operating segments, geographic regions and channels. Revenue was positively affected by strong growth in the Technical Apparel segment, which was driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth, e-commerce expansion, as well as a rebound in Greater China following the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2022. The Outdoor Performance segment also experienced healthy growth driven by footwear, our performance in Greater China, and the benefit of product supply normalizing following the pandemic. Ball & Racquet Sports rose more moderately as growth in basketball and sportswear offset softer baseball and team sports sales which led to targeted promotional actions in these categories to clear excess inventory in the fourth quarter. _Net Loss_ We estimate that our net loss will be between $(234.0) million and $(204.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $(252.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

For a more complete understanding of the notes and the note guarantees, please refer to the section entitled “Description of Notes” in this offering memorandum. Issuer ................................................................. Amer Sports Company, a Delaware corporation. Securities Offered .............................................. $600 million aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Secured Notes due 2031. Maturity Date ...................................................., 2031. Interest Rate ....................................................... % per year. Interest Payment Dates ...................................... and       , commencing       , 2024. Interest will accrue from       , 2024. Optional Redemption ......................................... The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after          , 2027 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum. In addition, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, prior to          , 2027 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “makewhole” premium as described under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to          , 2027, up to 40% of the aggregate amount of the notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to      , 2027, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes during any 12-month period at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Change of Control Offer .................................... Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of Notes—Change of Control”), you will have the right, as holders of the notes, to cause the Issuer to repurchase some or all of your notes at 101% of principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.” Asset Sale Offer ................................................. If the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to purchase the notes at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.” ----- Note Guarantees ................................................ The notes will be jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company and each of the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a borrower under or guarantees the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If any such subsidiary that is organized outside of the United States is not able to enter into such guarantee on the Issue Date, we intend to cause such subsidiary to provide such guarantee as promptly as practicable thereafter, and the indenture will require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such guarantees to be issued within 120 days after the Issue Date. Under certain circumstances, our subsidiary guarantors may be released from their guarantees without the consent of the holders of the notes. See “Description of Notes—Note Guarantees.” Certain guarantees may be subject to certain limitations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each guarantee of the notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to avoid the notes or the guarantees and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the notes.” See also “Annex A— Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” Collateral ........................................................... The Issuer and the Note Guarantors will, subject to certain exceptions, grant liens on a first-priority basis on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, that secure borrowings under the Credit Agreement, in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent (as defined below), pursuant to certain security documents (the “Collateral Documents”). The Collateral will exclude certain Excluded Assets (as defined under “Description of Notes”). We expect to grant liens on substantially all of the Collateral provided by the Issuer and the U.S. guarantors (excluding immaterial real estate and real estate located in a flood hazard area) and located in the United States on or prior to the Issue Date, subject to certain exceptions, and to perfect such liens by Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) filing on or prior to the Issue Date, in each case to the extent perfection may be achieved thereby (subject to a post-closing period for certain Collateral). After the Issue Date, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to create and perfect liens on the Collateral not perfected on or prior to the Issue Date within 120 days after ----- the Issue Date. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Perfection and Non-Perfection of Security Interests in Collateral” and “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” For more information on the security granted, see “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.” Certain Collateral may be subject to certain limitations. See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” Intercreditor Agreement .................................... The collateral agent for the notes (the “Notes Collateral Agent”) will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with Wilmington Trust (London) Limited (the “Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”), setting forth therein the relative rights with respect to the Shared Collateral (as defined under “Description of Notes”) and covering certain other matters relating to the administration of security interests. Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will generally (subject to a 180-day “standstill period”) control substantially all matters related to the Shared Collateral, including with respect to decisions, or enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the notes may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders of the notes. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will also include waivers of certain important rights that holders of the notes would otherwise have. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.” Ranking ............................................................. The notes and the guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will be subject to local law limitations: - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities; - be senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective future subordinated indebtedness; - be effectively pari passu with the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the Collateral; - be effectively senior to the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness ----- that is unsecured, or that is secured by junior liens, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - be structurally subordinated to the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future obligations secured by assets that are not Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, preferred stock and other liabilities of each of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors would have had $1.991 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, $1.941 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness, and approximately $604 million would have been available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we had no subordinated indebtedness outstanding. In addition, the notes and the guarantees will be structurally junior in right of payment to all liabilities and preferred stock of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, on a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented 19.4% of assets and 23.0% of liabilities, to which the notes will be structurally subordinated. For the year ended December 31, 2022, on a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented 41.6% of our net sales and 48.4% of our EBITDA. Certain Covenants ............................................. The indenture that will govern the notes will, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; - make certain investments and other restricted payments; - create liens; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - engage in mergers, consolidations or amalgamations; and - transfer and sell assets. These covenants will be subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In addition, at any time the notes are rated investment grade, certain covenants will no ----- longer be in effect for the remaining term of the notes. For more details, see “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.” Additional Amounts ......................................... In the event that certain taxes are payable in respect of payments under or with respect to the notes or the guarantees of the notes (excluding any taxes imposed by the taxing authorities in the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia), the Company or the applicable Note Guarantor, as the case may be, will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such additional amounts as will result, after deduction or withholding of such taxes, in holders or beneficial owners of notes receiving the amounts which such holder or beneficial owners of notes would have received in respect of the notes and the guarantees thereof, respectively, had no such withholding or deduction been required. See “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.” Optional Tax Redemption ................................. The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, in certain circumstances in which the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor, as the case may be, would become obligated to pay additional amounts under the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption due to Tax Reasons.” Governing Law ................................................. The notes, the guarantees and the indenture that will govern the notes will be governed by the law of the State of New York. Transfer Restrictions ......................................... The Issuer has not registered the notes under the Securities Act, and the notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. The Issuer does not intend to issue registered notes in exchange for the notes to be privately placed in this offering and the absence of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the notes. For more information, see “Transfer Restrictions.” Absence of Public Market for the Notes ............ The notes are a new issue of securities and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. The Issuer does not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on any securities exchange or an automated dealer quotation system. Accordingly, a liquid market for the notes may not develop. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and any market making with respect to the notes may be discontinued without notice. No Registration Rights ...................................... We will not be required to, nor do we intend to, register the notes for resale under the Securities Act or the securities ----- laws of any other jurisdiction or to offer to exchange the notes for registered notes under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Use of Proceeds ................................................. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, after commissions and discounts and fees and expenses incurred in connection with this offering, and proceeds from the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit facilities. See “Use of Proceeds.” Trustee, Registrar and Paying Agent ................ Bank of New York Mellon Notes Collateral Agent ..................................... Wilmington Trust (London) Limited Other Relationships ........................................... Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders or agents under our existing credit facilities and therefore will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering upon repayment of amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities. See “Plan of Distribution” for more information. Risk Factors ....................................................... In evaluating an investment in the notes, prospective investors should carefully consider, along with the other information in this offering memorandum, the specific factors set forth under “Risk factors” for risks involved with an investment in the notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Accordingly, we view expenses related to this litigation as outside our normal course of operations and not representative of our expected and recurring expenses. Legal expenses for other normal, recurring legal proceedings and other legal matters are not included in this adjustment. (j) We granted share-based compensation to employees under our equity compensation plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, but did not incur any expenses related to share-based payments in such periods as options granted under our equity compensation plans only vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the occurrence of an exit event, such as an initial public offering, and we did not believe an exit event was probable during such time. We expect to recognize expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based payments in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ----- Margin because we believe that such expenses are not representative of our ongoing expenses as they relate to recognition in a single period of incentive compensation granted over a period of several fiscal years.

We believe that the brand images we have cultivated have significantly contributed to the success of our business and are critical to maintaining and expanding our consumer base. Maintaining and enhancing our premium brands may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product design, intellectual property, operations, marketing, supply chain (including raw materials, manufacturing and distribution), sustainability, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”), community relations, employee training and our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) and wholesale distribution channels, including investments in additional distribution partnerships, the opening of new owned retail stores and new owned e-commerce websites, the inclusion of products on third-party e-commerce platforms, and other e-commerce projects, and these investments may not be successful. We anticipate that, as our business continues to expand into new markets and new product categories, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become difficult and require expending significant resources. If these or similar efforts in the future are not successful, our brands may be adversely impacted. Even if such efforts are commercially successful, they may dilute our image in our brands’ respective core markets, including apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories. In addition, our brands may be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by negative publicity. Our brands currently have significant autonomy within the structure of the Amer group with respect to the implementation of their strategic goals. Decision makers at our respective brands could take actions that harm our overall reputation or lead to the loss of goodwill by wholesale partners and consumers. Likewise, the reputation of our brands could be damaged by adverse publicity regarding Amer Sports and if decision-makers of Amer Sports take actions that would be viewed negatively by our wholesale partners, consumers or the general public. Furthermore, our exposure to social media platforms may accelerate and aggravate such negative publicity. In addition, ineffective marketing, product diversion to unauthorized distribution channels, product defects, counterfeit products and failure or legal limitations to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce the intellectual property rights in our brands may threaten the strength of our brands, and those and other factors could diminish consumer confidence in us. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a leader in premium performance in the sports and outdoor industry and to continue to offer a range of high-quality products to our consumers, which we may not execute successfully. Any of these factors could harm our business, reputation, prospects, financial condition or operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,Changes in market trends and consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.,"We are a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and outdoor activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. Consumer preferences and, as a result, the popularity of particular designs and categories of apparel, footwear and accessories, generally change over time. Similarly, consumer preferences may also change as it relates to sporting equipment and protective gear, as interest in certain sports and outdoor activities may wane over time. Our success depends in part on our ability to promptly anticipate, understand and respond to changing apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories trends, popularity in sports or outdoor activities and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our efforts to maintain and ----- improve our competitive position by monitoring and timely and appropriately responding to changes in consumer preferences, increasing brand awareness and enhancing the style, comfort, performance and/or perceived value of our products may not be successful. If we are unable to maintain or enhance the images of our brands or if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to new competition, changing consumer preferences and evolving trends and interests (including due to product lead times which make it difficult to rapidly shift sourcing and manufacturing to align with such changes), consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated and associate our brands with styles and activities that are no longer popular, which would decrease demand for our products. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business. Such failures could result in loss of market share, reduced sales, excess inventory, trade name impairments, lower gross margin and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"Our products, services and experiences face intense competition.","The sports and outdoor industry is highly competitive and fragmented both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure apparel and footwear companies and sports equipment companies, including both private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories, some of which have more resources or broader products lines. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of third-party manufacturers that produce certain of our products. In addition, we and our third-party manufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw materials used in our products. Our DTC brand platforms, both through our e-commerce operations and owned retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers, which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores. Furthermore, we believe that our wholesale partners face intense competition from other department stores, sporting goods stores, retail specialty stores, and online retailers, among others, which could negatively impact the financial stability of their businesses and their ability to conduct business with us. Brand image and recognition, product offerings and quality, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), innovation and design, sustainability, distribution, pricing, costs of production, customer service, e-commerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology, a reduction in barriers to the creation of new apparel and footwear companies and consumer preferences in the markets for apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail, including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop, and the continued proliferation of e-commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our DTC and wholesale operations. Some of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader consumer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition, and greater financial, research and development, store development, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competition, our costs may increase, demand for our products may decline, possibly significantly, or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

However, as competition in the sports and outdoor industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships, partnerships and other relationships also have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with such organizations or our brand ambassadors or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. Additionally, certain of our agreements with such organizations are subject to renewal in the near term, and there is no assurance we will renew such agreements on the same terms or at all. As a result, our brands, revenue, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain brand ambassadors were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken or statements made by athletes, teams or leagues, or other brand ambassadors, associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of ----- those brand ambassadors, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor or non-performance by our brand ambassadors, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products and brand, or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Issues that might pose a reputational risk include: - product liability, product recalls, and product boycotts including due to failure to obtain any applicable professional organization or safety or performance certifications; - product sponsorship and brand ambassador relationships, including those with athletes and celebrity brand ambassadors, professional and collegiate sports leagues, influencers or group affiliations; - public stances on controversial social or political issues; - our handling of issues relating to sustainability and ESG matters, including the transparency of setting or our progress toward sustainability and ESG expectations, goals and initiatives; - perceptions of our or our affiliates’ supply chain and sourcing practices, including due to geopolitical tensions; - perceptions of our principal shareholders; - our social media activity; - failure of our cybersecurity measures to protect against data breaches; - failure to comply with applicable laws, sanctions, trade or other regulations; - issues with management or other key personnel, as well as labor issues; and - any of the other risks enumerated in these risk factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of social media and a constant, on-demand news cycle may accelerate and in the short-term increase the potential scope of any negative publicity we or others might receive and could increase the negative impact of these issues on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

We must continue to invest in research and development in connection with the innovation and design of our products in order to attract and retain consumers. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to introduce new products or modify our existing products on a timely basis, we may lose wholesale partners and consumers or become subject to greater pricing pressures. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations and designs do not respond to the needs and demands of our wholesale partners and consumers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market. Any failure on our part to innovate and design new products or modify existing products may harm our brand image and consumer demand for our products could decline and could result in a decrease in our revenue and an increase in our inventory levels. ----- In addition, we believe our wholesale partners and consumers view many of our products as premium quality. If we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems along with a loss of consumer confidence and loyalty, and consumers may also be unwilling to pay premium prices for such products. Additionally, if the quality of certain of our brands and/or certain of our brands’ products does not meet expectations, that could negatively impact consumer views about our other brands and/or such brands’ products as well.

Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession and trade wars, political turmoil, the availability and cost of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, levels of unemployment, inflationary pressures, lower corporate earnings and fluctuating interest, foreign currency exchange rates and tax rates. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, including in light of the conflict in Ukraine, and with increasing inflation, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions as a result of significant increases in employment, financial market instability, and uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products. Consumer demand for our products may decline as a result of store closures, an economic downturn, or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia, which in turn may result in reduced orders from wholesale partners and consumers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenue, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.

Labor shortages may also negatively impact us from servicing any demand that exists for our products or operating our manufacturing facilities efficiently. Further, inflationary pressures could increase other key costs, such as the cost of raw materials, operational expenses and costs of labor, which would make it harder to operate our business and maintain current profit margins.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.9,Our financial success may be impacted by the strength of our relationships with our wholesale partners.,"Our financial success is partially dependent on our wholesale partners continuing to carry our products and the success of these partners. A substantial amount of our sales are made through our wholesale partners, either directly or indirectly, who may decide to emphasize products from our competitors, to redeploy their retail floor space to other product categories, or to take other actions that reduce or discontinue their purchases of our products. Although we believe that our business relationships with our wholesale partners are positive, we cannot assure you that these business relationships will continue to generate satisfactory sales in the future. If any of our major wholesale partners fails to remain committed to our products or brand, then these partners may reduce or discontinue purchases from us, which could adversely impact our business. If we face supply chain difficulties or other delays in our manufacturing and distribution channels and if we cannot fill our wholesale partners’ orders in a timely manner, the sales of our products and our relationships with those partners may suffer, and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our product lines and our results of operations. Many of our wholesale partners also compete with each other, and if they perceive that we are offering their competitors better pricing and support, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products. In addition, we compete directly with our wholesale partners by selling our products to consumers through our DTC channel. If our wholesale partners believe that our DTC channel diverts sales from their stores, this may weaken our relationships with our partners and cause them to reduce or discontinue purchases of our products. In addition, if we fail to accurately identify the needs of our partners, our partners fail to accept new products or product line ----- expansions or attribute premium value to our new or existing products or product line expansions relative to competing products or if we fail to obtain shelf space from our wholesale partners (whether by our competitors introducing new products or otherwise), our sales, business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.10,We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale partners and consumers.,"We generally do not have long-term contracts with our wholesale partners, and sales to our wholesale partners are generally on a per-purchase basis. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer the majority of our wholesale partners the opportunity to place orders several months ahead of delivery under our pre-order program. Sales to our wholesale partners are generally on an order-by-order basis and these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. We also extend credit to our wholesale partners based on an assessment of such retailer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. While we do not have significant concentration among our wholesale partners as of September 30, 2023, our largest single customer accounted for 2.9% of total accounts receivable and our 20 largest wholesale partners accounted for 27.4% of total accounts receivable. Some of our retailers have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, which have had and could have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. In addition, we and our wholesale partners could face risks from a decline in the overall level of consumer retail spending, and a weak retail environment could impact consumer traffic in the stores of our wholesale partners and also adversely affect our revenue. Moreover, traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels have experienced low growth or declines in recent years and recent trends have increased permanent and temporary store closures. Recent years have also seen shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices, which may increase the difficulty for us to retain and grow our consumer base through our wholesale partners. If and when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our wholesale partners, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on highquality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. These and other risks could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Growing our e-commerce platforms and the number of physical stores we operate is essential to our growth strategy, as is innovating and expanding our product offerings available through these channels. Sales in our DTC channel continue to grow, which may expose us to other risks, including those relating to continuing to grow brand awareness. This strategy has, and will continue to require significant investment in cross-functional operations and management focus, along with investment in supporting technologies and retail store spaces. If we are unable to provide a convenient and consistent experience for our consumers, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if our ecommerce platform design does not appeal to our consumers, function reliably and conveniently, or maintain the privacy and security of consumer data, or if we are unable to consistently meet our brand promise to our consumers, we may experience a loss of consumer confidence or sales, including as a result of losing repeat consumers, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, cyberattacks or other issues which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our growth in the DTC channel may also negatively impact our relationships with existing wholesale partners. As of September 30, 2023, we operate our e-commerce digital platforms in approximately 20 countries, where we generally also operate in through our wholesale channel, and we are planning to expand our e-c ommerce platform to other geographies. Existing and additional countries may impose different and evolving laws governing ----- the operation and marketing of e-commerce websites, as well as the collection, storage and use of information on consumers interacting with those websites. We may incur additional costs and operational challenges in complying with these laws, and differences in these laws may cause us to operate our businesses differently in different territories. If so, we may incur additional costs and may not realize benefits from our investment in our international expansion. We are also exposed to the risk of fraudulent domains or websites pretending to sell our products, when they are in reality phishing websites or imitator domains, and we might be unable to stop those websites from operating in due time, or permanently due to regulatory or factual constraints.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In order to generate consumer traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations generally within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with other retailers for prominent locations; or the success of individual shopping centers or districts. As we seek to expand the number of our brands’ retail stores, we may spend significant time and resources exploring locations that are not suitable or that we are unable to secure, whether due to financing, political constraints, or other factors. We may be unable to successfully open new store locations in existing or new geographies in a timely manner, if at all, which could harm our results of operations. Existing store locations may also become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume, consumer traffic and profitability generally may be harmed by, among other things: economic downturns in a particular area, competition from nearby retailers, changing consumer demographics in a particular market, changing lifestyle choices of consumers in a particular market, and the closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our stores. Changes in areas around our store locations that result in reductions in consumer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales, business and results of operations to be less than expected. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability could be harmed. Additionally, as we grow our retail store footprint, there is a risk that we will increase sales in retail stores at the expense of our wholesale business and/or our e-commerce DTC sales.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including risks inherent in entering new markets in which we may not have prior experience; potential loss of significant customers or key personnel of the acquired business; not obtaining the expected benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis or at all; managing operations in new geographies; and potential diversion of management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Acquisitions may also cause us to incur debt or result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, write-offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. We may not be able to obtain financing for future acquisitions on favorable terms, making any such acquisitions more expensive. Any such financing may have terms that restrict our operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into our operations and achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions, and certain acquisitions or divestitures may not have the desired effect of enhancing the status of our portfolio of brands. Our acquisitions and our divestitures have in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, exposure to contingent or unexpected liabilities, such as litigation, indemnification claims, regulatory claims and earn-out obligations. We may not consummate a potential acquisition for a variety of reasons, but still incur material costs in connection with an acquisition that we cannot recover. The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or achieve the expected benefits of strategic acquisitions in the future, or consummate a potential acquisition after incurring material costs, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. ----- In addition, we have divested, and may divest in the future, businesses, brands and assets as part of ongoing efforts to refine our portfolio and redefine our strategic priorities. These divestitures may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested businesses, brands or assets or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures.

In the past, third parties have established websites to target users on social media platforms with “look alike” websites intended to trick users into believing that they were purchasing our brands’ products at a steep discount. Some individuals who actually made purchases from such “look alike” websites believed they had purchased from our actual website and subsequently submitted complaints to us. These activities of third parties may result in consumer confusion, require us to incur additional administrative costs to manage consumer complaints related to counterfeit goods, divert consumers from us, cause us to miss out on sales opportunities, and result in a loss of our market share. We could also be required to increase our marketing and advertising spend. If consumers are confused by these other products and believe them to be actual products sold by our brands, we could be forced to deal with dissatisfied consumers who mistakenly blame us for poor service or poor-quality goods. In addressing these or similar issues in the future, we may also be required to incur substantial expense to protect our brands and enforce our intellectual property rights, including through legal action in the United States or in foreign countries, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Many of our brands’ products also carry warranties for defects in quality or workmanship. The Company provides product warranties on many products. Many of these product warranties are limited in time to one to two years, but certain of our brands issue longer warranties on specific products. For example, Arc’teryx provides warranties on its packs, accessories and apparel for the “Practical Product Lifespan” which can be an extended period, such that warranty claims for such products may be brought many years after the product was sold.

Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom (the “UK”) and its relationship with the European Union (the “EU”), as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the United States and elsewhere, as further described below under “—Risks Related to Our Financial, Accounting and Tax Matters—We could be subject to changes in tax laws, tax regulations and tax treaties, including their interpretation and application, in the Cayman Islands, Finland, Germany, the United States, the PRC, or any other country in which we operate, which could result in additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate” and “—Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation—Changes to trade policies, tariffs, import/export regulations and anticompetition regulations in the United States, EU, PRC and other jurisdictions, or our failure to comply with such regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.” We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” and only in the context of describing PRC laws, regulations and other legal or tax matters in this offering memorandum, excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). See “—We face risks associated with our business in the PRC.” There could be legislative actions limiting outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States, which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to sell products in certain markets, demand for our products in certain markets, our ability to collect accounts receivable, our or our third-party manufacturers’ ability to procure raw materials or manufacture products, distribution and logistics providers’ ability to operate, our ability to operate brick and mortar stores, our workforce, and our cost of doing business (including the cost of freight and logistics) may be impacted by these events should they occur and changing laws and regulations. Our exposure to these risks is heightened in the PRC, where a significant portion of our third-party manufacturing is located. Should certain of these events occur in the PRC, they could cause a substantial disruption to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics and public health crises, terrorist acts and political or military conflict, such as the conflict in Ukraine, have increased the risks of doing business abroad. Such political and economic instability, and any resulting negative sentiment toward the countries where we operate, sell or have our products manufactured, could interrupt our ability to operate internationally. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import finished products, our ability to move and store products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.18,We face risks associated with our business in the PRC.,"For the year ended December 31, 2022, 14.1% of our revenue was derived from sales in the PRC. In addition to our sales activity, we have key suppliers and manufacturing facilities in the PRC, and approximately 33% of our products sourced from third-party suppliers were manufactured in the PRC in 2022. Additionally, ANTA Sports, our largest shareholder, has significant operations in the PRC and has a principal place of business in the PRC, as well as management and directors that are PRC citizens or domiciled in the PRC. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business in the PRC, including but not limited to, a general climate of economic, political and social conditions, including with respect to future regulatory, policy and legislative developments, increased costs and uncertainties associated with enforcing contractual obligations in the PRC and increasingly strengthening intellectual property protection system in the PRC, each of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, and such measures and policies relating to such measures are evolving and ----- subject to change. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of companies with Chinese operations to conduct their business. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release additional regulations or policies that directly or indirectly affect the sports and outdoor industry or require us to seek additional permission to continue our operations, which could result in a material adverse change in our operation. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, where prior court decisions have limited precedential value. The PRC legal system is evolving rapidly, and the interpretations and enforcement of many laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy but may have a negative effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies in the PRC governing the regulation of our products, tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property or financial regulation may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. More broadly, while the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in the PRC, in the policies of the PRC government or in the laws and regulations in the PRC could have an adverse effect on the overall economic growth of the PRC. Such changes could also adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of any other countries or regions, such as increased duties or tariffs on imports from the PRC, may adversely affect our business. For more discussion of the risks related to our Chinese operations, see “—Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation—There remain some uncertainties as to whether we will be required to obtain approvals from PRC authorities to list on the U.S. exchanges and offer securities in the future, and if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Like our competitors, we have an extended design, development, manufacturing and logistics process, which involves the initial design and development of our products, the purchase of raw materials, the production of finished goods, the accumulation and subsequent sale of inventories, and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable. This production cycle requires us to incur significant expenses relating to the design, development, manufacturing, distributing and marketing of our products, including product development costs for new products, in advance of the realization of any revenue from the sale of our products, and results in significant liquidity requirements and working capital fluctuations throughout our fiscal year. Because the production cycle typically involves long lead times, which requires us to make manufacturing decisions several months in advance of an anticipated purchasing decision by the consumer, it is challenging for us to estimate and manage our inventory and working capital requirements, and as such challenges have been, and could in the future be, exacerbated by global supply chain issues. If we fail to accurately forecast demand or our inventory and working capital requirements, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver through our DTC channel and to our wholesale partners. In addition, our wholesale partners may fail to accurately forecast the demand for our products and may purchase an insufficient amount of our products or may accumulate excess inventory, each of which could negatively impact our business, brand and results of operations. If we underestimate the demand for our products, we may not allocate sufficient budgetary resources and may not be able to produce or source products to meet our wholesale partner requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our failure to satisfy demand, as well as damage to our reputation and wholesale partner relationships. If our wholesale partners underestimate the demand for our products, they may not have enough products on hand to satisfy demand in a timely fashion and sales opportunities may be lost. If we or our ----- wholesale partners overestimate the demand for our products, we or our wholesale partners could face inventory levels in excess of demand, which could result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would harm our gross margins and our brand management efforts. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows from period to period, which could result in the misallocation of our resources. In addition, these and other factors, including failures to accurately predict the level of demand for our products and future revenue, costs and cash flows, could cause a decline in revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers,13.2.2,"The operations of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control, including those that may result in significant disruptions in supply, and that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.","We rely on our suppliers and, while we have multiple suppliers available for the majority of our product components, certain of our suppliers are the sole source for specific components of our apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories. For example, Gore-Tex is used in certain Arc’teryx, Salomon, Peak Performance and Atomic products, with Arc’teryx products representing 90.4% of our total spend on Gore-Tex and Salomon, Peak Performance and Atomic products representing 3.8%, 5.4% and 0.4%, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have in the past experienced significant disruptions as a result of global supply chain issues and there can be no assurance that there will not be a further disruption in the supply of raw materials or other products from current suppliers or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials or products of comparable quality at an acceptable price, in a timely manner or at all. Identifying a suitable supplier is a resource-intensive process that requires us to become satisfied with their technical capabilities, quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or component sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our supply chain. In addition, freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide as there is much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment. The majority of our manufacturing and finished goods as well as raw material suppliers are located outside the United States. In addition, we work with select third-party distributors, especially in the initial stages of expansion for highly complicated products and in new markets, and because we ultimately do not control those third parties, we are subject to additional risks as a result of such relationships. Moreover, in 2022 approximately 33% of our apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories products sourced from third-party suppliers were manufactured in the PRC, with the remainder being produced in other Asian countries, North America and Europe. We experienced disruptions to our footwear business due to COVID-19 lockdowns adversely affecting certain of our suppliers in Asia. Many of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers. As a result of our international suppliers and third-party manufacturers, we are subject to risks associated with doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including: - political unrest, terrorism, labor disputes and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; - wholesale partner or consumer boycotts due to ethical, environmental or political issues in certain countries we do business with, such as for example, human rights and labor concerns in Asia, or product-related environmental concerns; - compliance with existing and new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions and workplace safety, environmental protection, chemical regulation, quality and safety standards, sustainability, ESG, transparency (the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and other related EU directives or regulations), imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds; - risks associated with doing business in or with the PRC, including as a result of the trade conflict, or other conflicts, between the United States and the PRC; ----- - reduced protection for intellectual property rights, including patent and trademark protection, in some countries; - disruptions or delays in shipments and supply chains globally; and - changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers, wholesale partners or consumers are located. In particular, compliance with the sanctions and customs trade orders could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Our ability to successfully import such materials may be adversely affected by changes in jurisdictions’ laws. See “—Increasing restrictions or additional requirements on products from certain areas, such as the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, may require us to incur additional costs, disrupt our value chain, or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial condition.” There are also increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies proactively monitor the environmental and social performance of their value chain, including compliance with a variety of labor practices and human rights considerations, as well as consideration of a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end-of-life considerations for products. For example, various jurisdictions have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that would require organizations to, among other things, conduct due diligence to identify certain environmental and human rights risks in their supply chains and take steps to mitigate any such risks identified. We have been and may continue to be subject to costs associated with such regulations, as well as any future regulations on the provenance of products or their component parts or materials, including for the diligence pertaining to these matters and the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The impact of such regulations may result in a limited pool of acceptable suppliers, and we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Additionally, because our supply chain is complex, we may face regulatory challenges in complying with applicable sanctions and trade regulations and reputational challenges with our consumers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the materials used in the products we sell. Even if we comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to additional expectations and scrutiny from investors, business partners, wholesale partners, consumers or other stakeholders on our environmental and human rights practices. These expectations are evolving quickly, and their application can involve substantial subjective determinations based on the context of specific circumstances. As such, certain of our actions or decisions, either currently or in the future, may be perceived to not align with best practices or stakeholder expectations, which could damage our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business. We also face risks from potential employment shortages for our supply operations as potential employees in certain geographies pursue opportunities outside of our and our suppliers’ industries. Any potential employment shortages may increase costs for our supplier and manufacturing partners and may limit our ability to scale our warehouse and factory operations efficiently. Increased costs in production may limit our profitability and may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These and other factors beyond our control could interrupt our suppliers’ production in offshore facilities, influence the ability of our suppliers to export our products cost-effectively or at all and inhibit our suppliers’ ability to procure certain materials, along with delays, interruptions or increased costs in supply or manufacturing of our goods, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

For example, in December 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (the “UFLPA”), which act imposes a presumptive ban on the import of goods to the United States that are made, wholly or in part, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the “XUAR”) or by certain other designated persons and entities. The XUAR is the source of large amounts of cotton and textiles for the global apparel and footwear supply chain. Although our policy is to prohibit the use of forced labor in our supply chain, we have previously been and may in the future be subject to allegations that our products contain components or raw materials from the XUAR and we cannot assure you that our affiliates may not also be subject to similar allegations. Furthermore, the U.S. Customs ----- and Border Protection (the “CBP”) issued a region-wide withhold release order (“WRO”) in January 2021, imposing import restrictions on cotton products produced in the XUAR. As a result of the UFLPA and WRO, materials we import into the United States have in the past been, and could in the future be, held by the CBP based on a suspicion that they originated from the XUAR or that they may have been produced by suppliers accused of participating in forced labor, pending our providing clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. While the UFLPA has not had a material impact on our results of operations, overcoming the presumptive ban in the UFLPA can be a time- and information-intensive process, which may require additional costs and can ultimately be unsuccessful. Even if such costs are incurred, we may not always be able to obtain sufficient information. Such a process could result in a delay or complete inability to import such materials (including potentially noncotton materials), which could result in inventory shortages or greater supply chain compliance costs. We could also be subject to penalties or fines if our imports are found to have been in violation of the UFLPA or other customsrelated laws and regulations. Even if we are not subject to any fines or penalties, any perceived link between our or our principal shareholder’s products and the XUAR, designated entities, or labor practices not in keeping with industry expectations may result in increased costs, affect our business and damage our reputation. Moreover, compliance with the UFLPA or other similar current or proposed requirements, including the European Union Forced Labor Ban Proposal, may have other effects on the global supply chain, the price and scarcity of traceable cotton or other materials of focus, and could lead to increases in our cost of goods sold, which may adversely impact our profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Significant price fluctuations, including as a result of inflation, or shortages or the cost of these raw materials may increase our cost of goods sold and cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer. Additionally, increasing costs of labor, freight and energy could increase our and our suppliers’ cost of goods. If our suppliers are affected by increases in their costs of labor, freight and energy (for example, because of rising global energy prices, increased global worker shortages impacting shipping and ports, truck driver shortages, increased congestion or other disruptions affecting the global distribution chain), they may attempt to pass these cost increases on to us.

Our ability to meet our wholesale partners’ and our consumers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our third-party manufacturers. While our agreements with our suppliers are generally fixed price arrangements on a purchase order basis that renew annually, if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, or be unable to perform, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have an adverse effect on our business operations, sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our third-party manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, it could result in lost sales, added costs and distribution delays that could harm our business and wholesale partner and consumer relationships. Certain of our third-party manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product. Such third-party manufacturers may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce. If, in the future, the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized third-party manufacturers no longer exist, we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of our brands’ products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters or other events outside our control affecting our warehouses or distribution centers, including political or labor instability. Additionally, since we share distribution warehouses among brands, a disruption at one distribution center may impact deliveries and shipments for numerous brands. We maintain business interruption insurance under our property insurance policies, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. We distribute our products to our wholesale partners and consumers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties, including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities.

The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in the sports and outdoor industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees. Some employees at our own manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are subject to collective bargaining agreements. For example, the employees at our Wilson brand Ohio manufacturing facility as well as the employees at our facilities in Austria, France and Germany, are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Labor disputes with these employees may have a material adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by wholesale partners or consumers, inability to fulfill potential e-commerce demand, unanticipated inventory accumulation and reduced revenue and net income. In addition, if we fail to mitigate labor disputes, fail to properly hire and dismiss employees as needed or fail to comply with labor laws, which differ by location and jurisdiction and are rapidly changing, our risk of litigation may increase, which would cause us to incur additional costs.

For more information, see “—Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.” Climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, or changes in the availability and/or cost of capital and insurance, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislation and regulation to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Failure to monitor, adapt, build resilience and develop solutions against the physical and transitional impacts from climate change, including any differences between what climate impacts we believe may occur and ultimately come to pass (including the timeframes associated with same), may negatively impact our brand and reputation, sales of our products and our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Further, some investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, current and prospective employees, and consumers have focused increasingly on sustainability- and ESG-related practices. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the environmental and social cost and related risks of their investments. Certain of these parties also use certain ESG ratings in their assessment of organizations, and unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to negative sentiment towards us. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation, share price, access to and cost of capital, and employee, wholesale partner, consumer, and/or business partner retention may be negatively impacted. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the management of sustainability- or ESGrelated topics, or disclosures on such matters. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change and other ESG matters and disclosure of related information, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. For example, we may be subject to the disclosure requirements of the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (and its implementing laws and regulations) and other EU directives or EU and EU member state regulations, the International Sustainability Standards Board’s sustainability and climate disclosure standards, various disclosure requirements (such as greenhouse gas metrics, climate risks, use of offsets, and emissions reduction claims) from the State of California as well as the SEC’s climate disclosure proposal, if finalized, among other regulations or requirements; these regulations and requirements may not entirely align and thus require us to duplicate certain or make different efforts or use different reporting methodologies in order to comply with each jurisdictions’ requirements. Separately, various regulators have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations on environmental marketing claims, including but not limited to the use of “sustainable,” “eco-friendly,” “organic,” “recyclable” or similar language in product marketing. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment, may require us to incur additional costs for the collection of data and/or preparation of disclosures and associated internal controls for same, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. ----- We also may at times engage in certain voluntary initiatives or commitments (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or targets, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products. However, such initiatives or commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, execution of these strategies and achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to set relevant, achievable and credible goals, execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; the availability and cost of raw materials and renewable energy; unforeseen production, design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon costs or climaterelated goals, or to other sustainability or ESG matters; adapting products to consumer preferences and consumer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. As a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our sustainability and ESG-related goals, which could damage our reputation and wholesale partner, consumer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, other methodological considerations, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies, and any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to act responsibly with respect to, such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, sustainability or ESG matters could result in adverse publicity or potential regulatory/investor engagement or litigation and adversely affect our business and reputation. For example, there have been increasing allegations of greenwashing against companies making significant ESG claims due to, among other things, allegations of incomplete disclosures, as well as to variety of perceived deficiencies in performance, including as stakeholder perceptions of sustainability continue to evolve. Additionally, many of our wholesale partners, consumers, business parties, and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers,13.2.10,Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.,"Given the broad and global scope of our operations, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change, such as shifts in weather patterns. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, factories, wholesale partners, consumers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers, wholesale partners and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, employees, wholesale partners, consumers, distribution centers and vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel, raw materials, and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties’ computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers, wholesale partners and consumers. In particular, our brands and products that cater to winter sports may be impacted by climate change, including due to seasonal shifts and rising temperatures. We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks (“IT Systems”), including the Internet and third-party services position us well, but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, ----- replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our IT Systems or supply systems, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our wholesale partners and consumers. For more information regarding risks related to our IT Systems, see “—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property and Information Technology—We rely on a large number of complex IT Systems. Any failure to operate, maintain and upgrade our IT Systems may materially and adversely affect our operations.” These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, to the extent catastrophic events become more frequent or intense, it may adversely impact the availability or cost of insurance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers,13.2.11,"Political uncertainty or geopolitical tensions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.","As a multinational company, geopolitical events could have an impact on our business. Changes, potential changes or uncertainties in regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we operate or sell our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has significantly amplified existing geopolitical tensions among Russia, Ukraine, Europe, the PRC and the United States. We cannot predict how the conflict in Ukraine will evolve, but any escalation or expansion into other countries, particularly in Europe, would exacerbate geopolitical tensions and could lead to political and/or economic response from the United States, the EU and other countries, which may adversely impact economic conditions. While we suspended all significant commercial activities in Russia by the end of 2022, and our revenue in Russia represented 1.8% and 0.5% of our revenue in 2021 and 2022, respectively, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect global energy and financial markets and thus could adversely impact our operations. In addition, any escalation or expansion into neighboring countries where we have significant operations could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global community, and counteractive measures may be taken by the Russian government, other entities in Russia or governments or other entities outside of Russia. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its direction. Although, to date, our IT Systems have not been compromised by these incidents, it is possible that future information security or cybersecurity incidents involving our wholesale partners, consumers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could successfully compromise our IT Systems, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actions by the United States and other governments, including the Russian government, may limit or prevent our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce any patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights in Russia. These actions could result in partial or complete loss of such intellectual property rights in Russia. For example, in March 2022, the Russian government adopted a decree allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or compensation. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our patented inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products made using our patented inventions in and into Russia. It is possible that the Russian government will adopt similar measures with regard to other types of intellectual property, including trademarks, or that Russian courts, even absent any additional decrees, will refuse to enforce existing intellectual property rights. Moreover, any prolonged non-use of our trademarks in Russia could result in the cancellation of such trademarks. Any counterfeit activity, grey imports, intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation or the sale of unauthorized versions of our products that emerge in response to these actions could damage our reputation and our brands and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For more information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, see “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology.” The extent and duration of the military action, the response thereto, including resulting sanctions, and resulting future market disruptions, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Additionally, any such disruptions, resulting sanctions or other actions (including cyberattacks) may magnify the impact of other risks factors discussed in this offering memorandum. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change and other environmental legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the United States, the EU and around the world, violations of the regulations of which could also result in claims for civil penalties or administrative remedies. The global nature operations expose us to the potential for inadvertent violations in cross border transactions and could result in sanctions or fines if such violations were to occur. Further, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. Tariffs and other changes in United States and other trade policies have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States, the PRC, the EU or any of its member states or in other countries could affect the trade environment. Trade tensions have escalated in recent years between the United States and the PRC, with each country imposing significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes. We, similar to many other multinational corporations, do a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and other countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations, the sports and outdoor industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have negative impact on our reputation business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our directors, officers, employees, agents or other partners or representatives, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies or such laws. We face significant risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or other partners or representatives fail to comply with these laws and governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Any actual or alleged violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions. Responding to any investigation or action would likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any of these consequences could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

For example, various jurisdictions worldwide have laws and regulations that aim to protect consumers, including by prohibiting advertising or marketing practices that may be deemed misleading or deceptive. Failure to comply with any laws or regulations could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. From time to time, we may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including, but not limited to, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In addition, we could become subject to potential antitrust claims, which may relate to anti-competitive behavior, pricing pressures on our distribution partners or other allegations, as well as regulatory actions related to anti-competition regulatory authorities in the United States, the EU and in other countries where we operate. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of money, harming our financial condition. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, harming our financial condition.

We have also received, and may in the future receive, products that are otherwise unacceptable to us or our wholesale partners and/or consumers. Under these circumstances, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. Additionally, if the unacceptability of our products is not discovered until after such products are sold, our wholesale partners and/or consumers could lose confidence in our brands’ products or we could face a product recall and our results of operations could suffer and our business, reputation and brands could be harmed. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties. Any defects could make our brands’ products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage or personal injury, in particular with respect to our sporting goods and equipment products, and we may become subject to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. The occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of our brands’ products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers or others who use our brands’ products are injured.

For example, on December 28, 2021, the CAC and other PRC authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022. The Cybersecurity Review Measures provide that “a network platform operator” that possesses personal information of more than one million users and seeks a listing in a foreign country must apply for a cybersecurity review. Further, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may initiate a cybersecurity review against any company if they determine certain network products, services, or data ----- processing activities of such company affect or may affect national security. As a network platform operator who possesses personal information of more than one million users for purposes of the Cybersecurity Review Measures, we have applied for and completed a cybersecurity review with respect to the Amer Sports IPO pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Administrative Measures”) and five supporting guidelines (collectively, the “CSRC Filing Rules”), which came into effect on March 31, 2023. According to the CSRC Filing Rules, an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the CSRC Filing Rules if the following criteria are met at the same time: (a) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profits, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year are accounted for by PRC domestic companies, and (b) the main parts of the issuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China. The CSRC Filing Rules also stated that the determination of whether it is applicable to the issuer will be done in accordance with the principle of “substance over form,” and that for issuers incorporated outside the PRC that do not meet criteria (a) and/or (b) in the preceding sentence, if the offering document includes major risk factors relating to mainland China, the lead underwriters and the issuer’s PRC counsel will be required to consider and analyze, in accordance with the principle of “substance over form,” whether the CSRC Filing Rules should apply. Furthermore, the CSRC Filing Rules provide a negative list of types of issuers banned from listing overseas, the issuers’ obligation to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection laws, and certain other matters such as the requirements that an issuer (i) file with the CSRC within three business days after it submits an application for initial public offering to the competent overseas regulator and (ii) file subsequent reports with the CSRC on material events, including change of control and voluntary or forced delisting, after its overseas offering and listing. As advised by our PRC counsel, we were not required to obtain regulatory approval from the CSRC or go through the filing procedures under the CSRC Filing Rules before our ordinary shares can be listed or offered in the United States because (i) the main parts of our business activities are conducted outside mainland China, and our main places of business are located outside mainland China, and (ii) our senior managers in charge of our business operation and management are predominantly non-PRC citizens or not domiciled in mainland China. Nevertheless, as the CSRC Filing Rules are newly issued, there remains uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted or implemented. Therefore, we cannot assure you that whether we will be subject to such filing requirements for our securities offering in the future, and if we do, we will be able to get clearance from the CSRC in a timely manner, or at all. Since these rules, statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. Changing regulatory requirements and any failure of us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer the ordinary shares, cause significant disruption to our business operations, severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and cause the ordinary shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, including patent, trademark, copyright, design and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to maintain, protect and enforce our rights in our brands, technologies, proprietary information and processes. Failure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. ----- We rely on our trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products from those of our competitors, to market our brands, and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, and we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved, and effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which our products are marketed and sold. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name that incorporates one or more of our trademarks or trade names may be available to be registered, or may be registered by us, even if available. Our trademarks and trade names, whether or not registered, may be infringed, diluted, misappropriated, declared generic, determined to be dilutive or otherwise violated. The validity and enforceability of our trademarks may be challenged, and our trademark registrations could be cancelled or may lapse. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote significant resources in advertising and marketing new brands. Further, competitors may adopt trademarks or trade names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be trade name or trademark infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation claims brought against us by owners of other trademarks, including trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. We have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, trademark coexistence agreements to settle such claims. Such agreements may restrict the ways in which we are permitted to obtain, maintain, protect, enforce and use the relevant trademarks. Without adequate protection for our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. Additionally, we rely on patent laws for the protection of our technologies and product designs. We plan to apply for, and expect to continue to apply for, additional patent protection for proprietary aspects of existing and new products and technologies. We cannot guarantee that our patent applications will be successful and result in issued patents. Even if issued, the patents may not be of sufficient scope to provide us with competitive advantages or may be of limited territorial reach. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents. Such proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as review, reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights. If such challenges are successful, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products, and we may also face increased competition to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Certain of our patents are due to expire in the near future, which may reduce or eliminate our competitive advantage in the jurisdictions in which these patents are expiring. Additionally, obtaining and maintaining patents can be time-consuming and expensive, and accordingly we do not seek patent protection in every jurisdiction in the world, and may not obtain certain of our patents in all of our key markets. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. It is also possible that third parties, including our competitors, may obtain patents relating to products or technologies that overlap or compete with our technology. If third parties obtain patent protection with respect to such products or technologies, they may assert that our technology infringes their patents and seek to charge us a licensing fee or otherwise preclude the use of certain of our designs or technologies. We also rely on agreements under which we contract to own, or license the rights to use, intellectual property developed by employees, contractors and other third parties, and to maintain the confidentiality of, and control access to and the use and disclosure of, certain trade secrets and other proprietary information to preserve our position in the market. We employ various methods to protect such intellectual property, such as entering into intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality agreements and non-compete agreements, as applicable, with certain employees, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators. However, we may fail to enter into such agreements with all relevant parties or such agreements may not be self-executing, and we may be subject to claims that such parties have misappropriated the trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information of their former employers or other third parties. In addition, such agreements may be breached or rendered unenforceable by changes in applicable law. Thus, our efforts may not be effective in controlling access to our proprietary information, and we may not be able to prevent all unauthorized use and disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, and under trade secret law, we have no protection against third parties who independently develop the same or similar technology. Depending on the parties involved in a breach of any such agreement, the available remedies may not provide adequate compensation for the value of the proprietary ----- information disclosed to a third party. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely impacted in our ability to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Furthermore, even if we successfully maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, competitors may independently develop products or technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our own. Intellectual property rights in certain elements of our products and manufacturing technology are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. As a result, our current and future competitors may be able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, designs and styling similar to our products. If our competitors sell products similar to ours at lower prices, our financial results could suffer. In addition, if any third party copies or imitates our products in a manner that affects our wholesale partners’ or consumer perception of the quality of our products, our reputation and sales could suffer whether or not they violate our intellectual property rights. We also may be forced to bring claims against third parties to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property or to enforce our intellectual property against its infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violations by third parties. However, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products that are substantially similar or superior to ours and that compete with our business. If we bring a claim to enforce our intellectual property, the defendant could claim that our asserted intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable and, if that defense is successful, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. The outcomes of such intellectual property-related proceedings are often unpredictable. In addition, even if we are successful in enforcing our intellectual property against third parties, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Regardless of whether any such proceedings are resolved in our favor, such proceedings could cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, if the strength of our intellectual property portfolio is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade others from collaborating with us to license intellectual property, or develop or commercialize current or future products. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Effective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing prosecution and maintenance requirements and the costs of defending our rights. Furthermore, monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors’ products, and may in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent the infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, or pursue all counterfeiters who may seek to benefit from our brand. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property rights could result in harm to our ability to compete and reduce demand for our products. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities. The global footprint of our product offerings exposes us to additional intellectual property challenges. Patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws vary significantly throughout the world. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as they are protected in the United States. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our intellectual property rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our intellectual property applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. It may therefore be difficult for us to successfully challenge the infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of our intellectual property by other parties in these other countries, which could diminish the value of our brand and cause our competitive position and growth to suffer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology,13.4.2,"Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may currently hold, or obtain in the future, patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights that could prevent or limit our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market certain of our products, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation made by third parties against us grows. While we try to avoid infringing the rights of others, we may unknowingly do so. For example, we may not be aware of existing patents or patent applications that could be pertinent to our business. Any claim or litigation alleging that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated intellectual property rights of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not settled out of court or determined in our favor, could be time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. While some claims may be made by third parties seeking to obtain a competitive advantage, other claims may be brought for the sole purpose of revenue generation, including by non-practicing entities or individuals with no relevant product sales. It may be more difficult to defend against such claims, as we cannot deter such claims by threatening to assert our own intellectual property portfolio in response. Additionally, some third parties have substantially greater human and financial resources than we do and are able to sustain the costs and workload of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, third parties may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to change our products or even cease the commercialization of our products entirely. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment, including being subject to an injunction and being required to pay substantial monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property rights. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations. Further, our liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. If we are required or choose to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, such arrangements may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. Such arrangements may also only be available on a non-exclusive basis, such that third parties, including our competitors, could have access to use the same intellectual property to compete with us. We may also have to redesign our products so they do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our products may not be available for commercialization or use. If we cannot redesign our products in a noninfringing manner or obtain a license for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our products and may be unable to compete effectively. In addition, in any intellectual property proceeding against us or that we assert against a third party, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Any of the foregoing, and any unfavorable resolution of such disputes and litigation, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Such agreements provide our licensees with rights to our intellectual property and contain provisions requiring our licensees to comply with certain standards to be monitored by us. Our failure to adequately monitor our licensees’ compliance with these standards, or to take appropriate corrective action when necessary, may subject our intellectual property to cancellation, loss of rights, or diminution in value. In addition, the licensing of any of our intellectual property could result in a potential misuse of such intellectual property. There can be no assurance that third parties will comply with their contractual requirements or that they will use our licensed intellectual property in an appropriate manner. Any misuse by a third party of intellectual property related to our trademarks or brands could lead to a negative perception of our brands by current and potential licensees, joint venture partners or consumers, and could adversely affect our ability to develop our brands and meet our strategic goals, which, in turn, could decrease our potential revenue. As a licensor of intellectual property, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits related to products designed or manufactured by our licensees. In most cases, our licensees are obligated to defend and indemnify us and our affiliates with respect to such litigation, but such indemnifying parties may be unable or unwilling to uphold their contractual obligations. We also may be required to indemnify certain of our licensees or wholesale partners for claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation brought against them. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all possible liabilities, and we have no assurances that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage of a claim. Any litigation has an element of uncertainty and if any such litigation were to be adversely determined, if a licensee were to fail to properly indemnify us, if we must indemnify a licensee or wholesale partner, and/or if we did not have appropriate insurance coverage or if our insurer denied coverage, such litigation could affect our financial position and liquidity.

If we fail to comply with our obligations in any current or future agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose licensed rights that are important to our business.","We are, and may become, party to license agreements, including endorsement agreements, with third parties to obtain the rights to certain intellectual property, technologies and products, or to allow commercialization or promotion of our own products. Such agreements may impose numerous obligations, such as development, payment, royalty, sublicensing, insurance, enforcement and other obligations on us in order to maintain the licenses. In spite of our best efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached such license agreements and might therefore terminate such license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to use certain brands or develop and commercialize products covered by such license agreements. For example, we license certain intellectual property rights from the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletics Association, other sports leagues and organizations, universities, athletes and influencers, among others, for use in connection with our products. If our license agreements or endorsement agreements with any one of these organizations, athletes or influencers were to terminate for any reason, we would be required to cease the development, advertisement, promotion and sale of certain of our products bearing such licensed intellectual property or modify the affected products or marketing materials to remove such licensed intellectual property. The foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability or financial condition. Disputes also may arise between us and our licensors regarding the intellectual property licensed to us under any license agreement, including disputes related to: - the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; - our compliance with reporting, financial or other obligations under the license agreement; - the amounts of royalties or other payments due under the license agreement; ----- - whether and the extent to which we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property rights of the licensor that are not subject to the license agreement; - our right to sublicense applicable rights to third parties; - our right to transfer or assign the license; and - the ownership of intellectual property and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose any or all of our rights under such license agreements, experience significant delays in the development and commercialization of our products and technologies or incur liability for damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may suffer if our licensors fail to abide by the terms of our license agreements, if our licensors fail to enforce licensed intellectual property against infringing third parties, if the intellectual property rights licensed to us are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are generally unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors, and, in connection with obtaining such licenses, we may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more favorable to the applicable licensor, including by agreeing to terms that could enable third parties, including our competitors, to receive licenses to a portion of the intellectual property that is subject to our existing licenses and to compete with our products. Our licensors may be free to exploit any rights that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis for themselves or to license such intellectual property to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to those offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, the agreements under which we may license intellectual property from third parties are likely to be complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The protection of this information is vitally important to us as the loss, theft, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of, access to or other processing of such information could lead to significant reputational or competitive harm, result in litigation involving us or our business partners, expose us to regulatory proceedings, and cause us to incur substantial liabilities, fines, penalties, or expenses. As a result, we believe our future success and growth depends, in part, on the ability of our key business processes and systems, including our IT and global communication systems, to prevent the theft, loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of, access to or other processing of this personal, confidential, and sensitive information, and to respond quickly and effectively if any such security incidents do occur. The frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyberattacks, ransomware attacks, and other security incidents, including personal information breaches, has significantly increased in recent years and it is expected that these trends will continue. As with many other businesses, we have experienced, and are continually at risk of being subject to, such attacks and incidents. Due to the increased risk of these types of attacks and incidents, we expend significant resources on IT Systems and security tools, measures, and processes designed to protect our IT Systems, as well as the personal, confidential, or sensitive information stored on or transmitted through those systems, and to ensure an effective response to any cyberattack or security incident. Despite the implementation of preventative and detective security controls, our IT Systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, ----- including telecommunications or network failures or interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, epidemics, malicious human acts, terrorism and war. Our IT Systems are also vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party service providers, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, from cyberattacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, password spraying, credential stuffing, phishing, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information), or other security incidents. These risks may be exacerbated in the remote work environment. Additionally, due to the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict, there have been publicized threats to increase hacking activity against the critical infrastructure of any nation or organization that is supportive of Ukraine. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to IT Systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated (including by threat actors’ increasing use of artificial intelligence), may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments or agencies, or state-sponsored actors, we may be unable to anticipate all types of security threats or implement adequate preventive measures in response. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to wholesale partners and consumers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of our IT Systems. We also use these systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. As such, any of the foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Cyberattacks or security incidents could remain undetected for an extended period, which could potentially result in significant harm to our IT Systems, as well as unauthorized access to the information stored on and transmitted by our IT Systems. Even when a security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be determined immediately. The costs to us to mitigate cyberattacks and security incidents could be significant and, while we have implemented security measures to protect our IT Systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful. Further, despite our security efforts and training, our employees may purposefully or inadvertently cause security breaches that could harm our IT Systems or result in the unauthorized disclosure of or access to information. Any measures we do take to prevent security breaches, whether caused by employees or third parties, have the potential to limit our ability to complete sales or ship products to our wholesale partners and consumers, harm relationships with our suppliers, or restrict our ability to meet our consumers’ expectations with respect to their online or retail shopping experience. A cyberattack or other security incident could result in the significant and protracted disruption of our business such that: - critical business systems become inoperable or require a significant amount of time or cost to restore; - key personnel are unable to perform their duties or communicate with employees, consumers or third-party partners; - it results in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access of wholesale partner, consumer, supplier or company information; - we are prevented from accessing information necessary to conduct our business; - we are required to make unanticipated investments in equipment, technology or security measures; - consumers cannot access our e-commerce websites and consumer orders may not be received or fulfilled; - we become subject to return fraud schemes, reselling schemes and imposter websites schemes; or - we become subject to other unanticipated liabilities, costs or claims. If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and result in harm to our reputation. Furthermore, although we currently maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans to address such disruptions, we may not be able to adequately continue our business or return to operability within a reasonable period of time in the case of such an occurrence. Recovery of our IT Systems may be additionally hampered where we have outsourced the operation of IT Systems and information storage to third parties. ----- A security breach that results in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental or regulatory investigation. Due to concerns about information security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding security of such information are possible. We are subject to an increasing number of reporting obligations, including, in some jurisdictions, an obligation to disclose our processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, and we have had to, and may in the future need to, notify governmental authorities, affected individuals and other third parties with respect to cybersecurity incidents. For example, laws in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the UK and all 50 U.S. states may require businesses to provide notice to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of an information security breach. Some laws impose specific data breach reporting obligations if special categories of personal information that we process, such as health data, is disclosed as a result of an information security breach. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of an information security breach would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny, sanctions and additional liability. We may also be contractually required to notify business partners of a security incident. Regardless of our contractual protections, any actual or perceived security incident, or breach of our legal or contractual obligations, could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability or require us to expend significant resources on information security and in responding to any such actual or perceived incident. In addition, if a cyberattack or other security incident results in the loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure of, access to or other processing of personal, confidential, or sensitive information belonging to our wholesale partners, consumers, suppliers, or employees, it could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the deterioration of our wholesale partners’ and consumers’ confidence in our brand, cause our suppliers to reconsider their relationship with our company or impose more onerous contractual provisions on us and subject us to potential litigation (including class action), liability, fines and penalties. For more information regarding risks related to data privacy and security, see “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology—We are subject to various laws, rules, regulations and guidelines relating to data privacy and security governing the use and processing of personal information. Changes in such laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include administrative fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension of processing activities and audits), private litigation or adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.” We are also reliant on the security practices of our third-party service providers, which may be outside of our direct control. These third parties, and the services provided by these third parties, which may include cloud-based services, are subject to the same risk of experiencing, and have experienced, outages, other failures and security breaches described above. IT Systems provided by third parties on which we rely also may be difficult to integrate with other tools due to their complexity, resulting in high data inconsistency and incompatibility. If these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices, or experience a breach of their systems, the information of our employees, wholesale partners, consumers and business associates may be improperly accessed, used, disclosed or otherwise processed, and we may potentially be held liable, or alleged to be liable, under certain laws or contractual obligations for the acts or omissions of our third-party providers. In addition, our providers may have broad discretion to change and interpret the terms of service and other policies with respect to us, and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. Our providers also may take actions beyond our control that could harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms, terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process information in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. Although we expect that we could obtain similar services from other third parties, if our arrangements with our current providers were terminated, we could experience interruptions in our business, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for alternative services. Any loss or interruption to our IT Systems or the services provided by third parties could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, and therefore the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us in connection with a breach or other cybersecurity-related matter could adversely affect our business and financial condition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Any failure to operate, maintain and upgrade our IT Systems may materially and adversely affect our operations.","It is critical to our success that wholesale partners and consumers and potential new consumers within the countries we operate in are able to access our online services at all times. We operate on a combination of shared and individual, central or local IT Systems, including cloud-based infrastructure, and related solutions. Any failure of either central or local IT Systems and functions may disrupt the efficiency and functioning of all our operations. Updates or changes in the software or hardware technology may lead to failures of communication between our platforms and consumers in the course of the order transmission or other processes. We therefore rely on a large number of IT Systems, as well as local network and internet coverage, to manage the entire process, from the placing of and payment for orders online by consumers to the receipt of and confirmation of those orders by our backend systems, which creates significant complexity and negatively affects our ability to scale our business and realize cost savings. We have made substantial investments into the development of our IT Systems, which form the backbone of our business operations. Due to the complexity of these IT Systems, we cannot rule out that they may cause or contribute to failures in the order transmission process or may prove less efficient than anticipated. In addition, a failure of any individual network carrier, IT System or IT provider would impact our ability to accurately predict the level of demand for our products, receive and transmit orders or to accept payment for orders. The efficient operation and scalability of our own IT Systems and the third-party IT Systems on which we rely is therefore critical to maintain operations and decision-making processes. We are currently in the process of upgrading our global SAP enterprise resource planning system across all our brands and may face risks related thereto, including an increased risk of cyberattacks or other security breaches. Furthermore, the continued operation and development of our IT Systems depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees. The loss of the services of such key individuals could harm our ability to maintain our IT Systems, which could materially and adversely affect our operations. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as consumer traffic increases. If our online marketplace is unavailable when users attempt to access it or does not load as quickly as consumers expect, they may seek other services, and may not return to our online marketplace as often in the future, or at all. This would harm our ability to attract consumers and decrease the frequency with which consumers use our online marketplace. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our online marketplace and to enable rapid releases of new products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, respond adequately to service disruptions, upgrade our systems as needed or continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations would be harmed. We have previously experienced service disruptions, and in the future, we may experience further service disruptions, outages, or other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. For more information regarding risks related to our IT Systems, see “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology—A security breach or other disruption to our IT Systems could result in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of wholesale partner, consumer, supplier, or sensitive company information or could disrupt our operations, which could damage our relationships with wholesale partners, consumers, suppliers or employees, expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings, or harm our reputation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

We collect, maintain, use and otherwise process information, including personal information, available to us through online activities and other consumer interactions in our business as well as from individuals in other circumstances, such as employee and business contacts, and certain of our marketing practices rely upon e-mail, cookies, tracking technologies and other e-marketing technologies to communicate with consumers. Our current and future marketing programs may depend on our ability to collect, maintain, use and otherwise process this information, and our ability to do so is subject to evolving U.S. and other international laws and enforcement trends, including in the EEA and UK where European court and regulatory decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws, rules and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If applicable data privacy and marketing laws become more restrictive at the international, federal or state levels, our compliance and other costs may increase, our ability to effectively engage consumers through personalized marketing may decrease and the effectiveness of our marketing may be limited, our investment in our e-commerce platform may not be fully realized or our systems may require significant changes, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance burden, our margins may be adversely affected and our potential reputational harm or liability for security breaches or compliance violations may increase. Moreover, in light of the complex and evolving nature of privacy laws, including relating to certain categories of data (e.g., biometric and health data) and cookies and tracking technologies (including those in the EEA and the UK), there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to comply with such laws and associated regulatory expectations. Violations of such laws and associated regulatory expectations could result in regulatory investigations, fines, orders to cease or change our use of such technologies, as well as civil claims including class actions, and reputational damage. In the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, rules and regulations concerning personal information and information security and have prioritized privacy and information security violations for enforcement actions. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA,” and collectively, “CCPA”), and several other state laws, which introduce new data protection and privacy rights, require covered companies to provide new disclosures, and in some cases introduce a private right of action for certain data breaches. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data protection law to which we would become subject if it is enacted, which may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risks, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies. We are also subject to international laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, which apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. For example, in the EEA, we are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), and, following the UK’s exit from the EU, we are subject in the UK to the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), which currently imposes the same obligations as the EU GDPR in most material respects. However, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate future changes to be made to the EU GDPR (such changes would need to be specifically incorporated by the UK government), which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. The EU GDPR and UK GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA and the UK. As the enforcement landscape develops, and supervisory authorities issue further guidance on international data transfers, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, we may have to make certain operational changes, we have had to and will have to implement revised transfer mechanisms for intragroup, customer and vendor arrangements within required time frames, the manner in which we provide our products could be affected, and it could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. We are subject to evolving data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations in the PRC, particularly the Cybersecurity Law (“CSL”), the Data Security Law (“DSL”), and the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), along with their implementing regulations and standards. These laws require that any collection, use, ----- transfer, and storage of personal information follow the three principles of legitimacy, justification, and necessity. Consent from the data subject is required, unless there are other legal bases for processing. Furthermore, operators of critical information infrastructure (“CIIOs”) and personal information handlers must locally store personal information and important data generated within the PRC, if it exceeds a certain threshold defined by relevant authorities. The CSL, DSL, and PIPL also specify rules for transferring personal information and important data outside the PRC. Compliance with security assessments or certifications by designated agencies or entering into approved standard contracts with overseas recipients are among the requirements for such transfers. In addition to the CSL, the DSL and the PIPL, the relevant government authorities of the PRC promulgated several regulations or released a number of draft regulations for public comments which are designed to provide further implemental guidance in accordance with the laws mentioned above. We cannot predict what impact the new laws and regulations or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the PRC, in particular the CSL, DSL or PIPL, or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the PRC due to their recent enactment and the limited guidance available, particularly on PIPL, which entities are awaiting further guidance on, particularly on the scope of data localization requirement. It is also generally unclear how the laws will be interpreted and enforced in practice by the relevant government authorities as often, the abovementioned laws are drafted broadly and thus leave great discretion to the relevant government authorities to exercise. We post our privacy policy and practices concerning our collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information on our websites and provide similar policies to our employees. Although we endeavor to comply with legal obligations and our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about privacy and information security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. In addition, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). PCI DSS is a specific set of comprehensive security standards imposed by payment card networks on companies that process credit card information, related to enhancing payment account information security, including, but not limited to, requirements for security management, policies, procedures and standards related to network architecture, software design and certification requirements. PCI DSS compliance is required in order to maintain credit card processing services and to provide our payment facilitation services. Additionally, we are also required to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. Payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some consumers, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. Moreover, compliance with PCI DSS does not guarantee a completely secure environment and, notwithstanding the results of a compliance assessment, there can be no assurance that payment card networks will not request further compliance assessments or set forth additional requirements binding on us to maintain access to credit card processing services. Compliance is an ongoing effort and the requirements evolve as new threats are identified. In the event that we were to lose PCI DSS compliance status (or fail to renew compliance under a future version of the PCI DSS), or if our information security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ and our third-party payments processors’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our consumers, process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs on us, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. Such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws, rules, regulations and guidelines relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our wholesale partners and consumers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies, wholesale partners or consumers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which could subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties, corrective measures or judgments, any of which could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties (including against officers), operational changes, and negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our results of operations and financial condition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Our ability to obtain additional capital, if and when required, will depend on our business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, market conditions, our credit rating and other factors.

Our functional currency is the euro. A large portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars, in particular the euro, the Canadian dollar and Renminbi (“RMB”), and generally the applicable local currency is our functional currency in that locality. Our sales are generally made in local currencies, while the majority of our costs are paid in U.S. dollars or the euro. As a result, we face foreign currency exposure on the translation of net income, assets and liabilities of our operations in numerous jurisdictions into U.S. dollars, including on our outstanding indebtedness denominated in euro. Given the strength of the U.S. dollar against our key foreign currencies, including the euro, the Canadian dollar and RMB, translation into U.S. dollars for the periods presented results in lower profitability. In the future, if the U.S. dollar continues to be strong against local currencies, we will continue to see lower profitability; however, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken against the euro or RMB, translation into U.S. dollars could result in increased profitability. Where possible, we manage foreign currency exposure through a variety of methods, including by financing each business unit in its functional currency and concentrating cash flows through centralized entities to limit the number of foreign currencies being utilized for purchases. Additionally, we enter into hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for a significant portion of our cash flows, in particular with our most commonly used foreign currencies, including euros, Canadian dollars and RMB. The majority of our hedging arrangements are short-term and are usually rolled forward within the standard business cycle. Nonetheless, it is not practical for us to mitigate all of our foreign currency exposure, nor are we able to accurately predict the possible impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, due to our constantly changing exposure to various foreign currencies, difficulty in predicting fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the significant number of foreign currencies involved. As we continue to expand our global operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant and could have a significant and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Foreign exchange variations have been significant in the past and current foreign exchange rates may not be indicative of future exchange rates, and may be further impacted by the efforts of central banks to curb inflation, in the United States as well as in the other jurisdictions in which we operate and recognize sales and incur costs. Significant variations in foreign exchange rates may also make hedging contracts ineffective for hedge accounting purposes in future periods.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually manufacture and produce products, including for our wholesale partners in advance of our and their peak selling periods. We manufacture a significant amount of inventory before the winter seasons. As such, working capital requirements typically increase throughout our second and third fiscal quarters as inventory builds to support our peak shipping and selling period which typically occurs from August to December.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, the material weakness related to (i) lack of consistent and proper application of accounting processes and procedures, defined control processes, including defined review and supervision roles in those control processes, and segregation of duties and (ii) insufficient resources with an appropriate level of technical accounting and SEC reporting expertise. We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness, including implementing new information technology and systems for the preparation of financial statements, implementing additional review procedures within our accounting and finance department, and hiring additional staff and engaging external accounting experts to support improving our accounting processes and procedures and supplement our internal resources in our computation processes. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) because no such evaluation has been required.

Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral and the guarantees and the obligations under the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest, fees and expenses may cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date such proceedings are commenced or initiated. Also, any use, sale, or lease or other disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding outside of the ordinary course of our business would require prior approval from the court (which may not be given under the circumstances). To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. In addition, the existence of certain permitted liens, or releases of Collateral under the Credit Agreement, will cause the relevant assets to become Excluded Assets (as defined under “Description of Notes”), which will not secure the notes or the guarantees related thereto. Additionally, the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes will allow us to issue additional notes and additional debt that may rank pari passu with the notes and incur refinancing indebtedness in certain circumstances. The indenture that will govern the notes will not require that we maintain the current level of collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the indenture that will govern the notes any such additional notes issued pursuant to such indenture and refinancing indebtedness or other additional debt incurred in accordance with the terms of such indenture will rank pari passu with the notes and be entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional debt and refinancing indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in full of the notes from the then existing pool of Collateral. In addition to releases upon any assets becoming Excluded Assets, releases of Collateral from the liens securing the notes will be permitted under certain other circumstances. See “Description of Notes.” In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the claims of the holders of the notes to the proceeds thereof will rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. The Notes Collateral Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent. Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on the Collateral. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will not monitor, or we may not inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisitions of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such afteracquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the notes against third parties. As a result, the inability or failure of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection, of the security interest for the benefit of the noteholders to which they would have been otherwise entitled.

In addition, to the extent that any guarantees by Note Guarantors outside of the United States are not in ----- place as of the closing, security interests in respect of Collateral owned by such Note Guarantors will similarly not be in place. See “—Certain guarantees may not be in place by the Issue Date.” With respect to any liens on or security interests in the Collateral that are not created or perfected on or prior to closing, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests created or perfected within 120 days of closing (as such date may be extended by the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement). It will not be a default or event of default under the indenture for the notes if we are unable to create or perfect such security interests by the applicable deadline, or thereafter, so long we have used commercially reasonable efforts to do so. Under U.S. bankruptcy law, to the extent a security interest in certain Collateral is granted or perfected after the date which is 30 days following the Issue Date, that security interest would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by certain of our other creditors) if we were to file for bankruptcy within 90 days after the grant or after perfection (or, under certain circumstances, up to one year thereafter). Other jurisdictions where the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will pledge, charge and/or assign assets have similar and sometimes longer hardening periods. Similarly, in other countries, there are a number of remedies under applicable legislation available to a trustee in bankruptcy, creditors of the debtor, other court appointed officer and other interested parties to seek to set aside or void a future pledge, charge and/or assignment of collateral for existing indebtedness.

Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a U.S. bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the Issue Date may be treated under U.S. bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In U.S. bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection or the issuance of a guarantee, a lien given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Issue Date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if the Issuer or any Note Guarantor were to file for U.S. bankruptcy protection after the Issue Date with respect to the notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected or the guarantees issued less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after the Issue Date.

The ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"In certain jurisdictions, including France, the security over the Collateral that (if and when granted) will constitute security for the obligations under the notes and the indenture related thereto will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes but only in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent or beneficiaries of parallel debt or analogous obligations, or “parallel debt.” This parallel debt is created to satisfy a requirement under the applicable laws that the Notes Collateral Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be treated as if it were a creditor of the relevant security provider. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations under the indenture that will govern the notes and the notes, or the “principal obligations.” Any payment in respect of the principal obligations shall discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt shall discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Although the Notes Collateral Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim for the full principal amount of the notes, holders of the notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Notes Collateral Agent. The parallel debt obligations referred to above will be contained in the indenture that will govern the notes, which will governed by New York law. There is no assurance that such a structure will be effective before applicable courts as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. The pledges governed by French law will be granted in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the secured creditors and will directly secure the parallel debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Trustee under the applicable indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the indenture) provide instruction to the applicable Notes Collateral Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-_ 25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1,1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition (the “Trust Convention”), and two réponses ministérielles dated January 24, 2008 and January 8, 2009 indicated its reluctance to do so to avoid conflicts between the “trust” and the French fiducie, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, an automatic stay of actions, including enforcement upon collateral, is imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, and secured creditors, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, are prohibited from foreclosing upon or otherwise repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be delayed). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of collateral as a result of ----- the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of such collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case, or whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and any additional obligations secured by first priority liens on the Collateral, including interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees, the holders of the notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured portion of the notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest or other adequate protection had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the notes. See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a discussion of the bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement and similar laws of other jurisdictions to which the Issuer or a Note Guarantor could become subject. In addition, as set forth above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the ability of the holders of the notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or use of cash collateral unless the controlling collateral agent opposes or objects thereto or certain limited specified conditions are not satisfied.

Your rights under the notes and the guarantees (and, as applicable, the Collateral Documents) will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings.

Each Note Guarantor, jointly and severally, will guarantee the payment of the notes on a first lien, senior secured basis and will provide the holders of the notes, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, with a direct claim against each relevant Note Guarantor. However, the indenture will provide that each guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Note Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee, as it relates to that Note Guarantor, avoidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. The indenture will also permit guarantees and security by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees and such security. Enforcement of any of the guarantees against any Note Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Note Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, transfer at undervalue, avoidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The Issuer or its creditors or the creditors of one or more Note Guarantors could challenge the issuances of any of the notes or the guarantees and any related security as fraudulent transfers, conveyances or preferences, transfers at under value or on other grounds under applicable U.S. federal or state law or other applicable law. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Note Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of any guarantee against any Note Guarantor. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the ----- Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to certain foreign subsidiaries. A court could avoid the obligations under the notes or any guarantee and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes if, among other things, it were to determine that the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor: - issued the notes or guarantee or any related security with the intent to prefer or defeat, hinder, delay or defraud its existing or future creditors; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the notes or the guarantee or any related security; and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantee or any related security, (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or any related security granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture that will govern the notes, which will also subject to the risk of being avoided as a preference to the extent they are issued after the date this offering closes. See “—Any future pledge, charge or assignment of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Issue Date might be avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy” and “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Note Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the extent such Note Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the benefit of the Issuer, and only indirectly for the benefit of such Note Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Note Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related security), subordinate them to the Note Guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer or conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other laws vary depending upon the law being applied in any particular proceeding, such that we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Note Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Note Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Note Guarantor was insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the notes constituted avoidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds under U.S. or other applicable law, or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or the Note Guarantor’s other debt. Generally, a Note Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets or fair value of its property was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The liability of each Note Guarantor under its guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee not constituting an avoidable preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside (although this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect the guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws). However, there can be no assurance as to ----- what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Note Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. Under U.S. law, to the extent a court avoids a guarantee and any related security as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or preference or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the notes would cease to have any direct claim against the Note Guarantor that delivered the guarantee and would be creditors solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any Note Guarantor under the relevant guarantee which has not been avoided. In the event that any guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the notes would be, to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, structurally subordinated to all liabilities and preferred stock of the applicable Note Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the notes or any guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the notes. Similar limitations could apply in other jurisdictions. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to certain foreign subsidiaries. In addition, any payment by the Issuer, or a Note Guarantor pursuant to the notes or a Note Guaranty made at a time that the Issuer or such Note Guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such Note Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such party’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such payment would give such party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case under the Bankruptcy Code (in certain cases, subject to certain defenses). Finally, as a court of equity, a United States bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against the Issuer under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to the Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend principally upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.

The New Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to, if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company, commencing with the last day of the first full fiscal quarter after the Issue Date for so long as any indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding, maintain (i) a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of not greater than 5.00:1.00 and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.00:1.00, which shall increase to 2.25:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025 and shall further increase to 2.50:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2026. The financial covenant contains a customary term loan facility standstill and customary cure rights. Further, our borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”)-based and/or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)-based interest rates. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate, has a very limited history and is based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. Changes in SOFR and EURIBOR can be volatile and difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities is difficult to predict. We can make no assurance that we will be able to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and the indenture in the future. If we fail to comply with the financial maintenance covenant, we would be in default, and our lenders would be permitted to accelerate our debt unless we could obtain an amendment. If our debt was accelerated, we would not have sufficient funds to repay our debt absent a refinancing, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain a refinancing. Our inability to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments could lead to a default or an event of default under the terms thereof, for which we may need to seek relief from our lenders and noteholders in order to waive the associated default or event of default and avoid a potential acceleration of the related indebtedness or cross-default or cross-acceleration to other debt. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such relief on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise and we may be required to incur significant additional costs. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Agreement may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us as a condition to granting any such waiver.

Furthermore, under these circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations and we may be unable to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.

While our brands have established heritage and market leadership today, significant runway remains ahead. We are excited about our future and the opportunity to drive growth in each of our three reportable segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports. Our segments comprise our “brand clusters,” which reflect both how our consumers engage with our products and how we manage our business. Each segment is led by one of our core brands: Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson. Arc’teryx is a technical outdoor apparel brand inspired by the Canadian Coast Mountains and built on the principle of obsessive, precise design and production. Arc’teryx gear pushes the boundaries of performance and enables adventurers to excel in their outdoor pursuits in the mountains, in the backcountry and on  some of the world’s most technical climbs. The products are known for their minimalist design, and sleek and streamlined aesthetic, along with new, innovative features that continually advance outdoor activities. Product quality, from the materials to the design, allows Arc’teryx to command premium pricing as evidenced by its best-selling “hardshell” jacket in North America, the Alpha SV. Overall, Arc’teryx combines beautiful, innovative products and an authentic brand experience that extends beyond apparel, fostering communities and bringing people together across all regions of the world who share a passion for the outdoors. Born in the French Alps in 1947, Salomon creates premium innovative footwear, apparel, winter sports equipment and accessories. Since its founding, Salomon has been fueled by a culture of design, craftsmanship, continuous innovation, and performance inspired by progress, the outdoors and athletes. The brand first produced metal ski edges and expanded into releasable ski bindings before launching industry changing rear- entry ski boots and monocoque skis. The brand’s leadership in winter sports helped to propel it into a diverse portfolio of sports and products including footwear and apparel. Today, Salomon is a market leader in global trail running footwear and premium hiking footwear, with products recognized for their performance, style, durability and sustainability. Over 60% of Salomon’s revenue in 2022 came from footwear, while also having leading market positions in its legacy winter sports equipment categories (skis, snowboards, boots, bindings, goggles, helmets, etc.), creating a 365-day, year-round brand serving all seasons for mountain sport consumers. Founded in 1914 in Chicago, Illinois, Wilson Sporting Goods is a leading manufacturer of high- performance sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. The Wilson Sporting Goods portfolio is made up of the iconic Wilson brand, as well as Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield and ATEC. Collectively, these brands bring more than three centuries of innovation, history and heritage to a variety of mainstream sports. As a multi-sports platform, Wilson drives innovation and product excellence by leveraging learnings across the brands’ various disciplines, including tennis, baseball and basketball, among other sports. The Wilson brand has a legacy as the top-of-the-line sports equipment and is associated with legendary athletes, including Roger Federer, Russell Wilson and Jamal Murray. In addition, Wilson is the official partner of professional sports leagues, including the NBA, WNBA, NFL, ----- the US Open and Roland Garros Grand Slam Tennis Championships, as well as the NCAA, making Wilson products integral to performance in sport. These athletes and leagues are a testament to the credibility and reputation of Wilson’s track record of innovation and superior products. While Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson stand tall and lead our three segments, our other brands appropriately fit our sports-oriented portfolio. Brands such as Atomic and Peak Performance enhance our scale, competitive positioning and diversification across sports categories. Together, our brands enable us to lead and compete in various sports segments and drive the continued success of our portfolio. We excel at identifying, developing and defining brands that meet our corporate vision. We empower these brands to autonomously connect with consumers and develop products to drive growth. Our platform supports the brands via scaled infrastructure and financial controls to accelerate performance.

We govern our brands through management across the finance, supply chain, sustainability, communication, legal and compliance functions, among other areas. At the same time, we enable our brands through our group’s incubator model that provides shared learnings from data analytics across the platform as well as from the economies of scale and synergies of shared resources, including supplier services, distribution and logistics, human resources and enterprise IT infrastructure. We further serve our brands through access to shared, centralized business services, including customer service and treasury management functions.

Our innovation process leverages our brand specific innovation centers and our dedicated research and design employees, many of whom use our products to participate in sports and outdoor activities. We also collaborate closely with our professional athlete brand ambassadors, who provide valuable insights into product design and performance that is used to inform and improve our innovation process. Further, our global DTC platform allows us to leverage datadriven insights from consumers across our brands to improve product development and innovation. This process and feedback loop allows us to drive innovation across our brands’ existing product categories to deliver cutting-edge performance for consumers globally. We believe our brands’ core product portfolios provide a base for growth and we are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve those products through innovation. Historically, we have successfully expanded our brands’ product categories by leveraging our innovation capabilities along with our strong brand equity and we intend to continue developing and introducing new products into underpenetrated and growing categories, particularly soft goods, across our brands. Nonetheless, developing new products is a complex, time-consuming process and may require significant capital investment. A new product may not achieve a successful launch or may not generate sufficient consumer interest and market acceptance to become a profitable product in the expected time frame, for the expected cost, or at all. In order to remain competitive within the product markets, distribution channels and geographies we currently compete in, we must continue to invest in innovation and develop, promote and bring to market new high-quality products.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Since the Acquisition in 2019, we have evolved our go-to-market strategy to emphasize a closer connection with our consumers through various distribution channels. We have experienced growth in the DTC channel across both owned retail and e-commerce, driven primarily by our Technical Apparel segment, led by the Arc’teryx brand, as well as our Outdoor Performance segment to a lesser extent. Since January 1, 2019, we have increased our net store count to over 330 owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023, representing an increase of approximately 69%. We believe we have the opportunity to significantly increase the number of new stores globally across our brands. Our owned retail stores, particularly Arc’teryx stores, ----- have demonstrated strong productivity levels and our owned retail rollout strategy looks to repeat and improve store productivity in the future. In addition, e-commerce has grown from 11.2% of our revenue in 2020 to 14.5% in 2022 and has further grown to 14.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and we believe we have significant runway to expand our digital penetration as we grow our brands’ awareness across geographies. We believe our DTC strategy provides significant benefits including the ability to personalize and control the consumer experience, generate impactful consumer data insights, capture a larger share of the value chain and improve gross margins in certain geographies, and certain brands and channels, highlighted to date by our Arc’teryx retail store rollout. We generally experience higher gross margins in our DTC channel. Effective implementation of our DTC strategy is integral to the continued growth of our business but it also involves continued investment. As we further penetrate the DTC channel, we expect additional capital expenditures to support our ongoing global owned retail store rollout. Our Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports segments primarily operate through the wholesale channel. The brands within these segments partner with strategic, premium wholesale partners such as well-known sporting goods retailers and specialty retailers dedicated to outdoor activities such as running. These wholesale partners provide access to our target consumers and drive brand awareness. While we expect to further penetrate the DTC channel across all our brands, including those within the Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet Sports segments, the wholesale channel will remain an integral part of our go- to-market strategy and overall growth opportunity, and we intend to maintain our relationships with our wholesale partners and continue to provide new and innovative products as well as brand marketing within the channel.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Across all of our brands’ markets, we plan to focus on increasing brand awareness, deepening DTC penetration, and optimizing our relationships with key wholesale partners as market conditions permit. We have demonstrated that we have the capabilities to drive growth in various geographic markets; however, our ability to successfully expand our business will depend on a number of factors, including our innovation, marketing efforts and consumer acceptance of our products.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.4,Ability to Manage a Global Supply Chain,"Due to the multi-brand and global nature of Amer Sports, we operate with a complex global supply chain. While each brand manages its individual supply chain, they leverage the global scale and capabilities of the Amer Sports platform to drive efficiency. Our platform allows us to establish strategic partnerships with key suppliers and retail partners across multiple markets and channels, where we further leverage our scale to drive flexible manufacturing capacity and supply chain optimization. We are focused on the continued growth of our brands’ apparel and footwear products, and as a result we expect the portion of our brands’ products being manufactured by third parties will continue to increase. We are focused on diversifying our supplier network, maintaining multiple manufacturing sources and expanding our distribution footprint. However, as we continue to scale our own manufacturing facilities, third-party sourcing and logistics footprint and distribution centers, we may be impacted by increased costs relating to our expansion efforts, including with respect to raw materials, labor, transportation and sustainability initiatives in an evolving regulatory and public opinion environment. Disruptions in our supply chain operations due to these or other factors could result in product shortages, declining sales, reputational damage or significant costs. Additionally, increasing geopolitical tensions could result in difficulty utilizing our global supply chain, whether due to sanctions, tariffs, or public perceptions of our operations in certain countries. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Distribution Network and Suppliers — Increasing restrictions or additional requirements on products from certain areas, such as the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, may require us to incur additional costs, disrupt our value chain, or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial condition.” -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Our global, data-driven approach to demand planning together with an integrative approach between sales, demand, and supply planning has enabled rapid growth while maintaining premium brand positioning. Incorrect inventory levels could result in missed sales opportunities, higher expenses, including higher freight costs due to a higher share of air-freighted product and increased distribution costs, and higher discounts towards wholesale partners and consumers, as well as higher or lower levels of working capital.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Historically, we have realized a slightly higher portion of our revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, primarily due to higher sales through our DTC channel compared to the rest of the year and a higher share of fall and winter collections in our Technical Apparel and Outdoor Performance segments. For example, we generated 34%, 33% and 38% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our Ball & Racquet Sports segment is generally more consistent across fiscal quarters. Working capital requirements typically increase throughout our second and third fiscal quarters as inventory builds to support our peak shipping and selling period which typically occurs from August to December. Cash provided by operating activities is typically highest in our first fiscal quarter due to the significant inflows associated with our peak selling season. We believe our strategy to broaden our assortment within the soft goods categories across all our brands, including for example Arc’teryx’s enhanced focus on spring and summer collections, could lead to increasingly balanced revenue and results of operations throughout the fiscal year.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.7,Foreign Currency Exposure,"We report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars but have significant non-U.S. operations. Our functional currency is the euro. A large portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than U.S. dollars, in particular the euro, the Canadian dollar and Renminbi (“RMB”), and generally the applicable local currency is our functional currency in that locality. As a result, we face foreign currency exposure on the translation of net income, assets and liabilities of our operations in numerous jurisdictions into U.S. dollars, including on our outstanding indebtedness denominated in euro. In fiscal year 2022, fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, we generated 64.9%, 66.6% and 66.6%, respectively, of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which in fiscal year 2022 included 21.6% in euros, 7.5% in Canadian dollars and 14.2% in RMB. In the same respective fiscal years, our total purchased and manufactured goods in currencies other than U.S. dollars were 18.0%, 19.9% and 24.2%, which in fiscal year 2022 included 15.7% in euros and 1.1% in RMB. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we generated 66.8% and 62.7%, respectively, of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 18.3% in euros, 7.1% in Canadian dollars and 18.9% in RMB. In the same respective periods, our total purchased and manufactured goods in currencies other than U.S. dollars were 17.0% and 18.3%, which for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 15.3% in euros and 0.8% in RMB. Given the strength of the U.S. dollar against our key foreign currencies, including the euro, the Canadian dollar and RMB, translation into U.S. dollars, for the periods presented results in lower profitability due to foreign currency exposure. In the future, if the U.S. dollar continues to be strong against our local currencies, we will continue to see lower profitability due to foreign currency exposure; however, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken against the euro or RMB, it could result in increased profitability. Where possible, we manage foreign currency exposure through a variety of methods, including by financing each business unit in its functional currency and concentrating cash flows through centralized entities to limit the number of foreign currencies being utilized for purchases. Additionally, we enter into hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for a significant portion of our cash flows, in particular with our most commonly used foreign currencies, including euros, Canadian dollars and RMB. Such hedging arrangements may include foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency swaps. The majority of our hedging arrangements are short-term and are usually rolled forward within the standard business cycle. Nonetheless, it is not practical for us to mitigate all of our foreign currency exposure, nor are we able to accurately predict the possible impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, due to our constantly changing exposure to various foreign currencies, difficulty in predicting fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the significant number of foreign ----- currencies involved. As we continue to expand our global operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

These factors include general economic conditions, inflation, consumer confidence, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, fuel, energy and freight costs and impacts of public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors that impact consumer discretionary spending, which remains volatile globally, continue to create a complex and challenging retail environment for us and our retail partners worldwide. By diversifying our supply chain and consumer geographical concentration, we seek to reduce our exposure to impacts on our business from macroeconomic volatility, including as a result of economic downturns in a single region. We intend to continue to evaluate and adjust our operating strategies to help further mitigate any impacts on our results of operations resulting from broader macroeconomic conditions, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business. In addition, changes, potential changes or uncertainties in regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we operate, or sell our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, trade tensions have escalated in recent years between the United States and the PRC. There could be legislative actions limiting outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to jurisdictions outside the United States, including through tariffs or penalties. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes. Further, the emergence of any such trade barriers could adversely affect our operating margins, which exceeds the margins of the business overall in the region. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation — Changes to trade policies, tariffs, import/export regulations and anti- competition regulations in the United States, EU, PRC and other jurisdictions, or our failure to comply with such regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Total amortization expense for right-of-use assets capitalized under IFRS 16 was $73.3 million, $74.1 million and $69.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(9) Includes expenses related to a certain patent infringement litigation. While we face such litigation from time to time, the magnitude of costs is rarely significant and this litigation expense is substantially higher than all but one other patent litigation expense in the last 10 years. Accordingly, we view expenses related to this litigation as outside our normal course of operations and not representative of our expected and recurring expenses. Legal expenses for other normal, recurring legal proceedings and other legal matters are not included in this adjustment. (10) We granted share-based compensation to employees under our equity compensation plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, but did not incur any expenses related to share-based payments in such periods as options granted under our equity compensation plans only vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the ----- occurrence of an exit event, such as an initial public offering, and we did not believe an exit event was probable during such time. We expect to recognize expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based payments in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we believe that such expenses are not representative of our ongoing expenses as they relate to recognition in a single period of incentive compensation granted over a period of several fiscal years.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Revenue can fluctuate as a result of changes in volume, price, product and channel mix and foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the products or services are transferred to the customer in accordance with the terms of delivery. Revenue from the sale of products within the DTC channel is generally recognized upon delivery for e-commerce customers or at the point the customer purchases the goods at our owned retail stores. Revenue within the DTC channel is revenue net of any value added tax, discounts, incentives, rebates or estimated returns. Revenue from the sales of products within the wholesale channel is generally recognized when the goods have been delivered to the wholesale partner’s specified location, when we deliver the goods to the carrier or when the wholesale partner obtains the goods from our warehouses. Following delivery, the wholesale partner has the primary responsibility for onward sales and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss. Revenue within the wholesale channel is revenue net of any discounts, incentives or rebates. Revenue from services, which primarily comprise freight services to customers of our goods, is recognized at the point in time upon the delivery of the goods when the control has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from license fees is recognized as a component of our wholesale revenue when the applicable counterparty manufactures or sells products bearing our trademarks. License income based on fixed license agreements is recognized evenly throughout the financial year, while license income determined by sales volumes is recognized during the financial year as the licensee generates sales revenue. We generally offer DTC customers of our products the right to return or exchange merchandise purchased within 14–30 days of receipt, while certain of our contracts provide wholesale partners a right to return goods within a specified period. A refund liability is recognized as a reduction of sales and a right of return asset is recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold, based on both historical experience and anticipated future returns.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The growth in total segment revenue for 2021 was primarily focused in the Americas, as revenues increased from $458.3 million in 2020 to $596.3 million in 2021, a growth of $138.0 million or 30.1%. Segment revenue on a constant currency basis for 2021 increased by $195.4 million, or 29.2%, compared to 2020. Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2022 increased by $3.7 million, or 6.5%, to $60.9 million, compared to $57.2 million in 2021. This was primarily driven by increased sales volume, gross margin improvement from pricing actions and product mix, despite higher product and sea freight costs, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, driven by the launch of Wilson’s sportswear line and higher IT, digital marketing and R&D expenses. Segment Adjusted Operating Profit for 2021 increased by $25.5 million, or 80.4%, to $57.2 million, compared to $31.7 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by increased sales volume, gross margin improvement from pricing actions and the shift in channel mix from increased sales through the DTC channel. This growth was partially offset by an increase in marketing and R&D spend to support our growth strategy and personnel costs following the end of many COVID-19 pandemic cost-saving initiatives.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.59,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,17.59.2,,"Management uses certain non-IFRS financial measures to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, which include constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We use constant currency revenue information to provide a framework to assess how our business segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial and operating performance from period to period, because they exclude certain material items relating to income tax expense, finance cost and depreciation and amortization which are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. In addition, management believes constant currency revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are measures commonly used by investors to evaluate companies in the apparel, footwear, sports equipment, protective gear and accessories industries. However, there are limitations to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures as analytical tools and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. Constant currency revenue is limited as a metric to review the Company’s financial results as it does not reflect impacts of foreign currency on revenue. Some of the limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin include: excluding certain tax payments that may reduce cash available to us; not reflecting any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; not reflecting changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and not reflecting the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt.

We expect to recognize expenses related to share-based payments during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, as the Amer Sports IPO became probable. We adjust for share-based payments in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that such expenses are not representative of our ongoing expenses as they relate to recognition in a single period of incentive compensation granted over a period of several fiscal years.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.70,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.70.2,,"Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, lease obligations and for general corporate purposes. Typically, the highest level of working capital has been reached in the third quarter when inventory and accounts receivable are at a peak during the fall and winter shopping season. Our future contractual obligations are further discussed in “—Contractual Obligations and Commitments” below. Historically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, shareholder loans and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. We had $402.0 million, $566.7 million and $389.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively. The ----- $164.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to inventory build-up following the supply chain disruptions experienced during 2021. The $177.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 as compared to January 1, 2021 was primarily due to the divestiture of the Precor business and the reduction of inventory related to supply chain disruptions. As of September 30, 2023, we had $284.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. The $117.8 million decrease as of September 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to use of cash in operating and investing activities. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow from operations and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our longterm capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including the rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts, new owned retail store openings and other growth initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new products, and overall economic conditions. We are also expecting increased capital expenditures related to the upgrade of our global SAP enterprise resource planning system over the next several years, which we are in the process of implementing across each of our brands, and the expansion of our warehousing facilities. Our capital expenditure budget for 2023 is approximately $200 million and we expect our capital expenditure budget for 2024 to be approximately $300 million. As of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Amer Sports IPO and the Offering Transactions, we would have had $1.991 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, which consists of $50 million under the Bilateral Facility (as defined in “Description of Other Indebtedness”), $600 million principal amount of notes offered hereby, $600 million incurred under the New USD Term Loan Facility and EUR 600 million incurred under the New EUR Term Loan Facility, $339 million of borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, $1.941 billion of which would have been secured indebtedness, and approximately $604 million would have been available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Summary—Recent Developments— Concurrent Refinancing Transactions” and “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that may restrict our operations. We also regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. If market conditions are favorable, we may refinance our existing debt or issue additional securities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms that are attractive to us or at all. The inability to raise capital may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The year-over-year improvement of $73.6 million was primarily due to improved operating profit, partially offset by an increase in inventory and higher interest payments. Cash outflow from operating activities was $91.7 million in 2022 compared to cash inflow from operating activities of $268.0 million in 2021. The year-over-year decrease of $359.7 million in cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory following supply chain recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by sales growth. Cash inflow from operating activities was $268.0 million in 2021 compared to cash inflow from operating activities of $297.9 million in 2020.

The year-over-year increase of $13.2 million in cash outflow from investing activities was due to a moderate increase in capital expenditures. Cash outflow from investing activities was $118.6 million in 2022 compared to cash inflow from investing activities of $295.4 million in 2021. The year-over-year decrease of $414.0 million in cash flows from investing activities was due to the sale of Precor in 2021 and a moderate increase in capital expenditure. Cash inflow from investing activities was $295.4 million in 2021 compared to cash outflow from investing activities of $106.7 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase of $402.1 million in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to the sale of Precor and moderate reduction in capital expenditure. Our capital expenditures (which we define herein to refer to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and the acquisition of intangible assets, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 totaled $90.0 million and $74.7 million respectively and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $109.8 million, $93.7 million and $106.0 million, respectively. _Financing Activities_ Cash inflow from financing activities was $97.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to cash inflow from financing activities of $47.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The year-over-year increase of $49.5 million in cash flows from financing activities was due to the draw down of short-term credit facilities to fund working capital. Cash inflow from financing activities was $81.1 million in 2022 compared to cash outflow from financing activities of $369.7 million in 2021. The year-over-year increase of $450.8 million in cash flows from financing activities was due to draw down of short term credit facilities to fund working capital.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.76,Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,17.76.1,Foreign Currency Risk,"Foreign currency risk primarily relates to the extent that sales, purchases, and borrowings of our foreign operations are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded by us. Assets and liabilities arising from such transactions are translated into the legal entity’s functional currency using the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate over the relevant period. Our functional currency is the euro. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars, and record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate in effect on the transaction date, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are outstanding at the end of a financial period are translated at the closing rate in effect on the applicable balance sheet date. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we generated 64.9%, 66.6% and 66.6% of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars and 74.1%, 77.3% and 78.0% of our operating expenses were incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we generated 66.8% and 62.7% of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars and 84.0% and 83.0% of our operating expenses were incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro, Canadian dollar, RMB or other foreign currencies in countries where we have operations, there is a negative impact on our operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. The translation impact of a 10% increase in the U.S. dollar against all other foreign currencies would have increased operating profit by $10.1 million, decreased operating profit by $3.9 million and decreased operating profit by $3.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential change noted above is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2022. Transaction risk arises from foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. 29.5%, 35.7% and 36.4% of our assets and 75.8%, 80.2% and 80.8% of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency exposure as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 29.5% and 29.1% of our assets and 76.7% and ----- 75.6% of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency exposure as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net impact after hedging based on a strengthening of the U.S. dollar by 10% vs. our five main currencies would have resulted in an increase in net loss of $20 million, $21 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential change noted above is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2022. Where possible, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure through a variety of methods, including by financing each business unit in its functional currency and concentrating cash flows through centralized entities to limit the number of foreign currencies being utilized for purchases. Additionally, we enter into hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations for a significant portion of our cash flows, in particular with our most commonly used foreign currencies, including euros, Canadian dollars and RMB. Such hedging arrangements may include foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency swaps. The majority of our hedging arrangements are short-term and are usually rolled forward within the standard business cycle. Nonetheless, it is not practical for us to mitigate all of our foreign currency exposure, nor are we able to accurately predict the possible impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, due to our constantly changing exposure to various foreign currencies, difficulty in predicting fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the significant number of foreign currencies involved.

Revenue is presented net of value added tax, discounts, incentives, rebates earned by customers and estimated returns. We recognize revenue under IFRS 15 at the point in time when control of the products and services are transferred to the customer in accordance with the terms of delivery at an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and services in the ordinary course of our activities. We apply the following five-step model when determining the timing and amount of revenue recognition: (1) identifying the contracts with customers; (2) identifying the separate performance obligations; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Contracts with customers generally consist of a single performance obligation, including merchandise, packaging and delivery activities. Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control over the goods and the required services have been performed. We recognize a contract liability for products for which control has not been transferred to the customer. We generally offer DTC customers of our products the right to return or exchange merchandise purchased within 14-30 days of receipt, while certain of our contracts provide wholesale partners a right to return goods within a specified period. A refund liability is recognized as a reduction of sales and a right of return asset is recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold, based on both historical experience and anticipated future returns. ----- In the wholesale sector, we offer certain major wholesale partners volume rebates, performance bonuses, and payment term discounts. We primarily utilize the expected value method to estimate the variable consideration for future rebates and performance bonuses. We recognize a contract liability for the sale of gift cards in both owned retail and e-commerce.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.77,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,17.77.3,Impairment of Non-Financial Assets,"We assess the carrying amounts of our non-financial assets, such as our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment at each reporting date. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset or the cash generating unit (“CGU”), which is the smallest group of assets generating cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each CGU. We assessed the carrying value of our non-financial assets for potential impairment during the fourth quarter of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Impairment is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Recognized impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. Key assumptions we use for impairment assessment include forecasted cash flows of the business, estimated discount rate, royalty rates and future growth rates. We use internal and external data to forecast the key assumptions. The cash flow projections are based on a 10-year financial forecast, of which the first five years are prepared by management and approved by our board of directors. To better reflect the medium-term growth expectations for the CGU in growing markets, financial forecasts after the first five-year period are extrapolated for a further five years using declining growth rates, which reduce the year-five growth rate to the long-term growth rate. We recognized impairment losses of $198.1 million for Peak Performance in 2022. In 2020 and 2021, no impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were recorded in the continuing operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The objectives of the 2019 ESOP and the 2023 ESOP are to align the interest of the shareholders and key employees in order to increase our value in the long-term, and to commit key employees to us. The 2019 ESOP and the 2023 ESOP provide for awards in the form of stock options to our key employees. The maximum number of options that may be granted under the 2019 ESOP and the 2023 ESOP is 3% and 1.2%, respectively, of all of our issued and outstanding shares. Options granted to employees vest once certain service and performance conditions are met, as well as upon the occurrence of an exit event. An exit event refers to a public offering of the Company’s shares or a sale of the controlling majority shares or business assets and is considered a non-market performance condition. When options ----- have service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures. This estimation is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is based on our best estimate of expected forfeitures, taking into consideration historical trends and expected future behavior regarding forfeitures. For options that depend on non-market performance conditions (i.e., an exit event), we recognize the related expense if and when we conclude that it is probable that the exit event will be achieved. No options were exercised, nor were any share-based payment expenses for equity-settled awards and cash-settled awards recognized, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020, in the latter case because the likelihood of occurrence of such condition was not deemed probable during any reporting period. We reassess the probability of achieving the non-market performance condition at each reporting date to ensure the accuracy of this assessment. The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model including any market performance conditions and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions. Equity-settled awards are measured on the grant date, while cash- settled awards are remeasured until settlement. See Note 10, “Share-Based Payments,” to our audited consolidated financial statements and Note 6, “Share-Based Payments,” to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Expected volatility has been based on the historical volatility of the comparable companies’ share price, particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected life of the options.

In addition, we have committed to set science-based near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets at the group level, which we intend to submit to be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). At the brand level, we are focused on sustainable business practices. For example, Arc’teryx opened five new ReBird™ Service Centers in the United States, Canada, Greater China and Japan. ReBird™ Service Centers offer consumers complementary repair services for their Arc’teryx gear, connecting consumers to the brand’s ongoing focus on improving circularity, including upcycling, resale, care and repair.

We continue to advance our products to meet our consumers’ needs, while enhancing our marketing strategies to clarify the premium brand positioning and drive a deeper emotional connection with consumers. We leverage creative product marketing, rich digital content, brand ambassadors and community building activities centered around the brands to create an authentic connection with the consumer that has resulted in stronger brand advocacy and loyalty. As our brands continue to grow, we will need to balance the risk of brand dilution with greater brand awareness, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected.

These tailored go-to- market strategies are designed to effectively reach target consumers and drive traffic and conversion. For example, Arc’teryx is aligned with a DTC channel strategy because of its technical apparel product portfolio where it can leverage a retail store base to deliver an immersive experience to consumers. Salomon is historically a wholesale driven business due to its legacy in winter sport equipment and relationship with specialty retailers for its footwear. However, with expanded consumer appeal and product portfolio breadth, Salomon has seen strong success in DTC in EMEA and Greater China. Wilson is predominantly focused on sports equipment through the wholesale channel, but its growing sportswear business is effectively utilizing owned retail, e-commerce and digital marketing to connect with younger consumers. In addition, since the Acquisition, both Salomon and Wilson have transformed their wholesale partnership networks with the aim to focus on high-quality partners who attract each brand’s target consumers. We believe our brands and products are highly valuable to our wholesale partners, which provides us broad distribution for a core product set. At the same time, we have a dedicated product portfolio that is geared towards our DTC customers. Our focus on connecting with consumers through the DTC channel provides us with datadriven insights across the portfolio, and we leverage that information to drive continuous improvement in our product development, marketing strategies and overall consumer experience. Across our three core brands, our global owned retail network includes 138 Arc’teryx owned retail stores, 114 Salomon owned retail stores and nine Wilson owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

As a result, we have grown our Greater China business significantly at a time when others were facing challenges or retrenching. We now have a deep understanding of the average consumer in Greater China and are able to deliver authentic, technical and premium products that align with consumer preferences. Our retail knowhow, including our ability to deliver a high-end, luxury oriented in-store presentation and execution capabilities have been upgraded significantly, allowing us to quickly identify and secure highly attractive store locations with desirable consumer foot traffic. For example, we have 63 Arc’teryx owned retail stores in Greater China as of September 30, 2023. The stores combined with our brand connects well with both pure outdoor adventurers and luxury consumers in Greater China. We also have 30 Salomon owned retail stores and a total of 67 Salomon distribution points (including owned retail stores and partner stores) in Greater China as of September 30, 2023, up from 13 in 2019. For Wilson, we recently became the exclusive NBA provider and licensee of basketballs, which is driving growth in the region, and the rapid adoption of winter sports in Greater China is driving Salomon and Atomic winter equipment sales. Our execution in Greater China has successfully increased our percentage of total revenue derived from the region from 8.3% in 2020 to 14.8%, or $523.8 million, in 2022, and up to 19.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and we believe there is significant runway for growth in the region as we continue to roll-out retail locations across our brands and scale our e-commerce platform.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Our brands are defined by innovative, excellent products with superior quality, sustainability and thoughtful design, enabling them to be “market shapers” and leaders in intensely competitive markets for products, services and experiences. For example, Arc’teryx produces specialty climbing and mountain apparel worn from the foot to the peak of the Canadian Rockies, Salomon attracts the best athletes with its footwear and winter sports equipment from the French Alps to trails across the world and Wilson Sporting Goods is a market leader for tennis equipment, baseball gloves, baseball and softball bats, basketballs and footballs. With multiple brands that are market leaders in their respective categories, we have a diversified, resilient portfolio. The consistency and profitability of our hard goods categories are complemented by multiple forward growth levers, including double digit, profitable growth in soft goods across large markets. As a group, our brands are complementary to one another while also geographically and seasonally diversified. We serve a wide range of global athletic and outdoor activities year-round. The relationship among our brands positions us to outfit the outdoor athlete from head to toe. For example, an outdoor athlete can ski on Atomic in the winter, wear an Arc’teryx jacket when rock climbing in the fall and run with Salomon shoes year round. Our market leadership in numerous categories, combined with the diversification of our portfolio, allows us to serve consumers around the world at all times of the year and reduces the aggregate level of seasonality across our business.

At the same time, our products fit and appeal to consumers of all skill levels.

Through a consumer-focused, design-led mindset, we emphasize understanding and meeting the evolving needs and demands of athletes and consumers. Our innovation processes are institutionalized through continued investment in research and development at our innovation centers. These include the Wilson Innovation Center in Chicago, Arc’teryx design centers in North Vancouver, Portland and Tokyo and Salomon’s Annecy Design Center in France. Our teams are constantly testing new ideas to improve our current offering and to be the first to commercialize new products, while balancing the potential lack of receptivity of new products, as well as shifting consumer preferences. Our brands are supported by former competitive athletes who enjoy an active lifestyle and have a desire to lean into hard problems and apply design to create possibility. We have an expansive network of hundreds of professional athletes and ambassadors across our brands who we actively collaborate with. We gather feedback, insights and ideas from them to incorporate into our designs. This direct feedback drives our product innovation engine and results in high-end products that are trusted by our consumers. We leverage advanced technologies to constantly improve our products and reaffirm the pricing power our brands command. For example, Wilson has driven innovation across sports including football, baseball, tennis and golf for over a century. Today, that culture of innovation is present in each of our brands as we are using artificial intelligence to design a baseball bat with a larger sweet spot, we have used 3D printing to create an airless basketball, and we use sensors and cameras on skiers to improve ski edge designs. Design features across our brands include Arc’teryx and Salomon developing new, greener membranes with Gore-Tex for their jackets and shoes, improving the waterproofing and breathability, Salomon’s patented Sensifit footwear technology providing precise and comfortable fit in combination with the differentiated Quicklace system and Wilson’s cushion core carcass in its basketballs designed to ensure an easy grip for players.

In 2022, 42% of our revenue was from the Americas, 36% from EMEA, 7% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 15% from Greater China. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 40% of our revenue was from the Americas, 33% from EMEA, 8% from Asia Pacific excluding Greater China, and 19% from Greater China. All around the globe, our brands are guided by a consumer-first mindset and meet consumers exactly where they shop, in both digital and physical spaces. Each brand boasts a multi-channel distribution strategy that is tailored to the brand’s product assortment. For example, Salomon has strong access to key specialty retailers in remote mountain locations where consumers buy trail running and winter sports equipment, where the customer base differs significantly from sporting good chains. Arc’teryx is oriented towards a DTC model with next generation retail locations that illuminate the brand identity and resonate with consumers, tailored to consumer preferences by region. As a group, we deploy a vertically integrated, DTC mindset, while leveraging our network of strong wholesale relationships. We are increasingly emphasizing our owned e-commerce and building out our owned retail distribution around the world. As of September 30, 2023, we have over 330 owned retail stores and growing. Our owned retail stores serve as attractive marketing tools that elevate the consumer experience, and, with the help of instore activations and events, enhance brand loyalty, build communities and generate a strong return-on-investment. Our owned retail benefits our global e-commerce business, which has grown significantly across all brands, up 88% from 2020 to 2022. The combination of our wholesale and DTC channels, along with our global infrastructure allow our brands to connect with consumers conveniently and seamlessly around the world. While our business and revenues are geographically diverse, this is the aggregate result of an extensive global footprint built and expanded at the local level and fostered over decades. Today we have owned retail stores in 24 countries representing generations of investment in local communities, which allows us the flexibility to tailor our approach to best meet the needs of local markets. We are nimble across markets and able to replicate success of new product launches in one region globally in a short period of time given our investments in our growing worldwide network.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

We also serve the brands in areas such as human resources, financial reporting, automation and continuous technological improvement. Across these functional areas, our brands benefit from infrastructure that they would not be able to build cost efficiently as standalone entities.

We have realized significant success in the region through a commercialization strategy specific to the Chinese market. Our leaders are empowered to make decisions quickly so that we can compete to win in a dynamic and evolving Chinese retail landscape. While the brand experience for consumers is consistent with each brand’s global ethos, we employ localization strategies that resonate with Chinese consumers. For example, Arc’teryx’s loyalty program includes over 1.7 million members in Greater China as of September 30, 2023, having grown from only fourteen thousand in 2018 due to the brand’s ability to leverage tools such as WeChat to accelerate loyalty member enrollment. Our strategy in Greater China also leverages a precise retail rollout combined with operational excellence. Store locations are selected using detailed data analysis, and we are keenly focused on optimizing store size and storelevel productivity. Each location seeks to bring to life our authentic brand stories. Our operational excellence allows us to refresh retail inventory on a regular cadence, helping to drive consistent traffic and excitement in our stores and facilitating a luxury experience. We have already demonstrated success in Greater China, having grown our revenue from $202.3 million in 2020 to $523.8 million in 2022, representing a 60.9% CAGR, and operating margins in the region exceeds the margins of the business overall.

In addition, while our initial success in Greater China was largely related to growth of Arc’teryx, we have developed a repeatable playbook with Salomon, which grew its revenue in Greater China by 72% from 2021 to 2022.

We believe our innovation model, which has been institutionalized across brands in each of our three segments, will allow us to expand our market shares within core categories, as well as tactically scale in newer categories. ----- Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx employs a hands-on, iterative product development process that begins with innovative ideas in the North Vancouver design center. These product innovations come to life via on-site prototyping at the nearby ARC’One facility. Further, the team rigorously tests the product in the Canadian Coast Mountains with world-class mountain athletes. This results in a product that meets our high quality standards and drives continuous innovation. Core innovation enables products like the Alpha SV waterproof breathable “hardshell” jacket to consistently be among Arc’teryx’s top selling products, supporting the brand’s market leadership within outdoor technical apparel and driving continued topline growth. Along with core outdoor category growth, Arc’teryx plans to grow its women’s category, where it has invested in new design leadership, including an expanded assortment, color palette and updated fits, along with rigorous engagement with female athletes to further expand market share with female consumers. For new product development, Arc’teryx recently opened a footwear development office in Portland, Oregon to be able to provide a more comprehensive offering to the outdoor consumer, while also further diversifying product line seasonality. Arc’teryx is also expanding its product portfolio through its popular contemporary urban lifestyle line, Veilance. These new categories are supplemented by sustainability programs, including ReCare™, ReCut™ and ReGear™. ReCare™ provides consumers with information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform. Within Outdoor Performance, Salomon is deeply committed to innovation in footwear, reflected by its worldclass design center in Annecy, France, along with a professional athlete collaboration program to design nextgeneration products. Through trail running, Salomon has been influential in shaping the modern outdoor footwear industry, rich in heritage of the French Alps. These innovations fuel the future of the sport, recently being worn by Courtney Dauwalter as she set back-to-back records at the Western States Endurance Race 100-mile run, and three weeks later, in the Hardrock 100 with the same pair of S/LAB Genesis shoes. S/LAB is the brand’s halo collection of specialty running and Nordic ski systems which have won races from the UTMB in Chamonix France to the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, China. The brand’s ADDIKT PRO on-piste ski line is made with recycled ABS sidewalls, demonstrating Salomon’s leading innovation. Historically, innovation has supported the evolution of Salomon’s iconic products like the XT-6, which was launched in 2013 and originally designed for ultra-distance trail runners under harsh conditions. This silhouette now creates the foundation of Salomon’s rapidly growing Sportstyle line, which creates a blend between function and fashion that is loved by athletes and consumers alike and represents a significant opportunity for the brand. Salomon Sportstyle footwear has become so culturally relevant that the MM6 Maison Margiela x Salomon Cross Low shoes have been worn by global superstars, including during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show, which was viewed by more than 115 million people globally. Sportstyle is the fastest growing collection in the Salomon brand with revenue over $80 million in 2022, and over $165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salomon also demonstrates an unwavering commitment to producing high-quality equipment for winter sports. During the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, athletes using Salomon products went on to win 28 Olympic medals, showcasing the technical excellence of the brand’s winter sports equipment from skis, ski boots, ski bindings, snowboards, snowboard boots and bindings. Two-time World Cup Overall Alpine ski racer Marco Odermatt has relied exclusively on Salomon ski boots and bindings in his wins. Salomon intends to continue leveraging its premier innovation capabilities to improve existing product lines as well as develop new products to drive growth and increase market share. In Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson’s in-house innovation capabilities, anchored by its innovation center located in Chicago, provide a competitive advantage and an engine for continuous growth. The brand’s significant scale, particularly compared to mono-sport competitors, allows Wilson to make significant investments in research and development. The innovation process leverages key insights from technical scientists, engineers and designers who have a deep understanding of sports and the technical needs of athletes who use Wilson products. For example, as of September 1, 2023, 27% of the top 100 men’s tennis players and 42% of the top 100 women’s players in the world use Wilson rackets. Other recent innovation examples include a Louisville Slugger baseball bat that uses simulation software combined with artificial intelligence, first utilized in the golf space and then expanded to baseball, to enhance the contact sweet spot, or the Evo NXT basketball that redistributes the weight of the ball with an advanced internal construction, making the ball easier to shoot from long range. New product introductions accounted for approximately 21% to 22% of revenue each year from 2020 to 2022 for Wilson, and accounted for approximately ----- 21% of the brand’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These product innovations drive market share growth in core sports as well as adjacent categories such as the increasingly popular games of padel in Europe and pickleball in the United States. As a new growth lever, Wilson is expanding its reach in soft goods categories in addition to sports equipment. Wilson is already experiencing success with its Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy, which involves launching tennis footwear and increasing exposure to apparel and represented 3.7% of total Wilson sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 5.1% of total Wilson sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We believe this category will continue to grow as a larger contributor to the Wilson business and help fuel broader brand engagement. Across segments, our plans to innovate, expand our product offering and successfully implement our growth strategy may not be successful, and implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

By capitalizing on our existing global presence and leveraging our brands’ strengths, we have a significant opportunity to strategically increase our presence in existing and new geographies by cultivating new customer bases where there is promising market demand and ample room for growth. Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx’s future geographic growth will be grounded in its historical momentum in North America and Greater China, with considerable opportunity in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. In North America and Greater China, the brand operates 48 and 63 owned retail stores, including seven and 21 factory outlets, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. During the period from 2019 to September 30, 2023, the brand has opened a net total of 30 new stores in Greater China, as well as a net total of 20 new stores in North America, with a net total of three additional stores opened during the fourth quarter of 2023. In Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific, Arc’teryx operates six and 21 owned retail stores, including two and five factory outlets, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. The brand intends to continue developing its retail real estate portfolio in these markets to drive brand awareness and growth. In Europe, there are retail opportunities in large metro areas such as Paris, as well as iconic, outdoor locations across the Alps, including Chamonix, France, Zermatt, Switzerland and St. Anton, Austria, where important community-building “mountain stores” are targeted to create authentic brand positioning. Within owned retail stores, Arc’teryx brand stores (excluding factory outlets) represent a key element of our overall growth strategy and vertical model. We use sales per square foot to assess the performance of Arc’teryx brand stores relative to their square footage. Sales per square foot is calculated using total sales from all brand stores (excluding factory outlets) that were open for the prior twelve month period, divided by their total square footage. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, in North America, Arc’teryx’s sales per square foot increased from $622 to $817, calculated on the basis of revenue of $43.9 million from 24 brand stores with an aggregate of 70,676 square feet in 2021 and $68.9 million from 29 brand stores with an aggregate of 84,367 square feet in 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, in Greater China, Arc’teryx’s sales per square foot increased from $1,251 to $1,269, calculated on the basis of revenue of $97.0 million from 35 brand stores with an aggregate of 77,586 square feet in 2021 and $126.5 million from 38 brand stores with an aggregate of 99,652 square feet in 2022, respectively. This measure of sales per square foot may not be equivalent to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies. For the 27 brand stores (excluding factory stores) open in North America during the twelve month period ending September 30, 2023 with an aggregate square feet of 79,072, brand store revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $54.0 million, compared to $36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, these stores generated $66.6 million in revenue. For the 36 brand stores (excluding factory stores) in Greater China open during the twelve month period ending September 30, 2023 with an aggregate square feet of 100,944, brand store revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $155.8 million, compared to $73.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022 these stores generated $124.9 million in revenue. ----- Within Outdoor Performance, while Salomon is relatively well known in Europe, we believe brand awareness is significantly lower in Greater China and the United States. These markets represent strong growth opportunities as the technical performance, innovative design and premium nature of the brand’s products, especially within footwear, align well with consumer preferences in these markets. In Greater China, Salomon has successfully opened 30 owned retail stores as of September 30, 2023 and has plans to accelerate its retail rollout in this market. Despite still emerging brand awareness, Salomon enjoys specialty niche market positioning in the United States, including being well known for its winter sports equipment. According to the Circana/Retail Tracking Service, it is the number two outdoor footwear brand in the United States for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on dollar sales. Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has a compelling opportunity to leverage its reputation for technical excellence in various sports activities, stemming from its historical success in the North American market. Wilson plans to expand its market leadership in North America while driving growth in both Greater China and Europe. In these newer markets, Wilson plans to leverage its partnership with the NBA as well as capitalize on increasing participation in sports and outdoor activities such as tennis. In Greater China, we believe that higher levels of participation in sports by children, young adults and women provide an opportunity to leverage the Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy to drive apparel and footwear growth while also developing a strong brand relationship with a large and dynamic consumer base. In Europe, Wilson plans to leverage its product authority in racquet sports to drive market share gains in padel, which is a popular fast-growing sport in the region. Fast growing sports like padel and pickleball are also fragmented and provide Wilson an opportunity to innovate on currently relatively standardized equipment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.88,Our Growth Strategies,17.88.3,Optimize Go-to-market Strategies to Conveniently Engage Consumers,"Each of our brands employs a customized go-to-market strategy that is tailored specifically to the brand’s attributes and designed to effectively reach and captivate consumers. We remain committed to further refining and enhancing our go-to-market strategies with the goal of expanding our market presence, fostering customer loyalty and driving growth. Our DTC strategy will continue to require significant investment and management focus and may present risks and challenges, while our wholesale strategy may be impacted by the strength of our relationships with our wholesale partners. Within Technical Apparel, for Arc’teryx, the DTC channel is the primary vehicle to engage consumers and drives both online and offline conversions. The DTC channel allows Arc’teryx to seamlessly leverage grassroots community marketing strategies and provides for a more agile inventory management model focused on consistent flow of fresh product. While Arc’teryx has a selective wholesale footprint that will remain an important element in its distribution strategy, we expect owned retail and e-commerce to continue to enable DTC to be the brand’s fastest growing channel. - _Retail Brand Stores: Elevated brand stores provide a critical space for Arc’teryx to engage directly with consumers, showcase products and build community. Its retail store strategy has evolved to include three differentiated store formats with square footage generally ranging from 1,000-10,000 sq. ft. With multiple store formats, the brand has expanded its retail store network, with a focus on global retail hubs like Shanghai and New York. The brand stores are highly productive with an average global sales per square foot of approximately $1,474 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Brand stores generally have been profitable with a target payback period of 24 months, with actual performance generally exceeding targets based on our global brand store openings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. The ReBird™ Care and Repair centers, incorporated in several new stores opened since 2022, have been an important element of the brand’s immersive store experience, not only to enhance our efforts in improving the circularity and reusability of our products, but also to drive traffic and consumer engagement. - _E-commerce: Arc’teryx’s digital platform is a catalyst for the business across all channels by growing brand awareness and serving as a global “storefront” for products and brand identity. We believe the Arc’teryx e-commerce platform will continue to grow as brand awareness accelerates through brand and community marketing investments, which contribute to Arc’teryx’s ability to adapt its business based on consumer data received from this platform. ----- Within Outdoor Performance, we have optimized Salomon’s go-to-market strategy from a traditional wholesale model to a modern and balanced consumer-centric retail strategy. The strategy is designed to elevate the brand by selectively choosing premium wholesale partners, curating and segmenting the inventory assortment with them, while also reaching more consumers on a direct basis through owned retail and e-commerce and providing engaging consumer experiences. While the channel mix remains primarily wholesale, DTC has grown significantly from 18% of brand revenue in 2020 to 21% in 2022 in an effort to drive penetration globally. - _Direct-to-Consumer: The brand has a strategic retail expansion plan, focusing on the development of multi- sport, experiential store formats in select major global cities, such as Paris and Milan, as well as increasing the number of Sportstyle focused stores in Greater China. For e-commerce, Salomon recently redesigned its website with a vision to inspire, guide and equip new and returning consumers to unleash their potential through mountain sports. We believe the platform provides an immersive and frictionless brand experience which has led to increased traffic and conversion. We expect growth on the e-commerce platform to scale with retail expansion as brand awareness increases and Salomon builds larger brand communities. - _Wholesale: Salomon targets high-quality wholesale partners, including specialty retailers, globally to attract new consumers. The brand collaborates with partners to drive higher per door productivity. Many of the brand’s specialty retailer partners focus directly on Salomon’s core competencies, including product expertise in hiking and trail running. Within outdoor and trail running shoes, Salomon is focused on consolidating the number of accounts and improving productivity. Within the Sportstyle category, Salomon is similarly focused on improving productivity while expanding the number of retail partners carrying the brand’s products. Salomon intends to further increase its number of strategic wholesale accounts in Europe, especially in underpenetrated areas of Western Europe, as well as the United States where Salomon seeks to target top-tier sporting goods retailers. Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson Sporting Goods’ go-to-market strategy revolves around highly productive wholesale relationships complemented by owned retail stores and an e-commerce platform that create excitement around Wilson’s categories and elevate Wilson’s brand. The wholesale channel is pivotal for Wilson as we believe many consumers prefer to shop in stores where expert recommendations are available and can be critical to driving the point-of-sale for sporting goods. Approximately 50% of Wilson’s wholesale revenue in 2022 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 came from differentiated specialty retailers. Through strong wholesale relationships and a complementary DTC strategy, Wilson aims to continue increasing consumer engagement in the appropriate channels. Importantly, while Wilson’s owned store footprint is expected to remain relatively small and targeted, these stores serve as important consumer touchpoints to build engagement with the brand in high-quality, immersive retail environments. - _Wholesale: Wilson’s wholesale channel comprises more than 15,000 wholesale partners globally for the year ended December 31, 2022, balanced between traditional and specialty retailers and smaller pro shops and country clubs. Through internal, specialized sales teams, Wilson closely collaborates with its wholesale partners to deliver a premium and educational consumer experience that drives brand productivity. From 2020 to 2022, Wilson meaningfully increased wholesale productivity with two of its top wholesale partners, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy, each increasing revenue by 101% and 73%, respectively. As Wilson continues to deliver superior products, it intends to continue increasing productivity and shelf space with strategic wholesale partners. - _Direct-to-Consumer: Wilson leverages DTC channels to complement its wholesale strategy by increasing brand awareness and elevating the brand. Wilson has owned retail stores in strategic locations, such as New York City and Chicago, which provide an immersive consumer experience and illuminate Wilson’s leadership across categories. The brand’s retail strategy is complemented by a global e-commerce platform with innovative digital capabilities, such as a direct-to-team baseball offering that leverages Wilson’s dynamic portfolio of brands and connections with baseball academies, clubs and organizations. Overall, we believe DTC will continue to play a critical role in driving traffic and conversion for Wilson in both the DTC and wholesale channels as brand equity and awareness grow.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.88,Our Growth Strategies,17.88.4,"Grow Brand Awareness, Expand Our Communities and Increase Customer Loyalty","We believe efforts to drive higher levels of brand awareness and increased customer loyalty across key markets are critical for each of our brands to achieve their commercial potential. As such, each brand has developed robust ----- global marketing programs that build on the authenticity of each brand through strategies ranging from “grass roots” local community activities, to large scale global on-mountain events, to sophisticated original content and social media campaigns that leverage digital marketing. Within Technical Apparel, Arc’teryx has created a reputation of authenticity and an uncompromising standard of excellence. The result has created a passionate, loyal following for the brand. However, Arc’teryx global brand awareness levels are relatively low when compared to more established premium outerwear brands. The brand plans to tactically increase brand awareness and curate more passionate communities through the following global strategies: - _Arc’teryx Academies: Each year, Arc’teryx hosts several global events in some of the most iconic alpine destinations around the world such as Chamonix, France; St. Anton, Austria and Whistler, British Columbia. Each Academy focuses on a different mountain sport discipline and is open to the public. In 2022, these events saw over 17,500 attendees and generated 76.5 million media impressions. - _Store-Driven Events: Arc’teryx’s events enable the brand to connect to the communities surrounding the brand’s stores. These events range from design discussions, music performances, to speaker series hosted both in-store and online. - _Original Content + Digital and Social Media: In 2022, Arc’teryx has produced 15 original content films with talented filmmakers that featured sponsored athletes. These films included examples such as Unfinished Business, a documentary about Greg Hill summiting all 20 peaks of the Spearhead Traverse in one day and Keep It Real, a video on the underground UK bouldering scene that provided original content to enable authentic brand storytelling across social media channels. We believe original content combined with digital marketing strategies will increase Arc’teryx brand awareness globally. Within Outdoor Performance, while the Salomon brand has existed for more than 75 years, we believe there is an opportunity to grow brand awareness globally, particularly in North America and Greater China. To drive brand awareness, Salomon plans to use the following integrated, brand-first marketing strategy to communicate key product stories: - _Television, Digital and Social Media: Using television, digital and social media, Salomon plans to effectively communicate its brand story to a large audience of consumers and form a deeper connection. For example, in 2022, Salomon unveiled the new “Tomorrow is Yours” campaign aimed at inspiring a wider, younger and more diverse audience to connect with the outdoors. We believe this comprehensive global campaign increased brand awareness and perception globally. - _Brand Ambassadors: Professional athletes trust Salomon in the most demanding competitive environments, which is the greatest form of product validation. In total, more than 600 professional athletes across trail running, snowboarding and alpine and Nordic skiing actively use Salomon products. These athletes provide individual product and brand storytelling opportunities to drive awareness. - _Loyalty Program: In 2022, Salomon launched its loyalty program, S/Plus which allows consumers to earn points for each purchase, access exclusive products and receive other members only benefits. The S/Plus program had over 1.2 million members as of December 31, 2022, the first year of its existence, and over 1.5 million members as of September 30, 2023. - _[Original Content: Salomon.tv originated in 2009 as the original branded content platform in sports. As of](https://salomon.tv/) September 30, 2023, more than 245,000 subscribers view 6-10 original and authentic stories per year highlighting athletes, sports, products and community. - _Events: Salomon has developed a leading series of running events in some of the most iconic outdoor destinations around the world called The Golden Trail Series (“GTS”). These events are the only running events in the world designed and developed for a global television audience. In 2023, GTS events will be broadcasted on Eurosport across 53 countries. Salomon plans to further increase spending to add events in Japan and Greater China to complement the United States and European races, entrenching Salomon as the leading global brand powering the sport of trail running. ----- Within Ball & Racquet Sports, Wilson has recently elevated its brand through consistent, cohesive brand messaging across sports categories. Today Wilson is thoughtfully balancing product marketing and brand marketing to engage consumers, and it intends to continue growing its brand awareness in key global markets through the following strategies: - _Professional Partnerships: For more than 110 years, Wilson has been and continues to be a part of championship-level performance for some of the world’s best athletes and iconic sports leagues. These endorsements and partnerships serve as a competitive advantage, providing a differentiated opportunity to convey a story around “Play What the Pros Play.” Wilson plans to continue leveraging these partnerships with both professional leagues and young aspiring talent across sport activities to build brand awareness globally. - _Strategic Marketing: Known for product excellence across sport categories, Wilson is establishing a cohesive brand identity that sources and amplifies brand equity from each categories’ leadership and authenticity, effectively shifting from category marketing to brand marketing. Wilson leverages digital marketing, social media platforms, experiential concepts and collaborations with brands such as KITH to deliver authentic brand and product messaging to consumers. The digital marketing strategy combines personalized targeting, engaging content and data-driven optimization to build brand awareness and drive consumer engagement. In 2022, the brand launched a marketing program for everyone to “Live Like an Athlete,” which immediately increased the brand’s social media engagement. Wilson continues to build on this brand momentum through the Wilson Tennis 360 Softgoods strategy and a comprehensive brand campaign delivered in 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

We believe the following trends influence the industries within which we operate and how consumers make their purchase decisions: - _Health & Longevity: We believe one of the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is an increased focus on health and longevity, resulting in increased participation in sports across genders, ages and geographies. For example, according to a survey conducted by a third-party research consulting group, approximately 50% of US consumers reported wellness as a top priority in their daily lives in 2022, an increase from 42% in 2020. We believe this increased focus on health and longevity is a trend that will continue and will drive consumers to purchase sports apparel, footwear and equipment to facilitate a healthy lifestyle through sports and outdoor recreation. - _Increased Casualization: There has been a shift towards more casual apparel and footwear options for daily use, a trend that has been accelerated by COVID-19. This casualization trend drives the need for products that can offer versatility across of a variety of use cases, whether in the office, or participating in outdoor activities. We believe our premium apparel and footwear products provide the necessary style, comfort and technical performance to allow consumers to seamlessly transition from one activity to the next while feeling confident throughout the day. - _Growth in the Premium Consumer Segment: Our brands target consumers who seek high-quality, premium performance products to help them perform at their best and feel confident on-and-off the court. According to the Credit Suisse 2022 Global Wealth Report, the number of adults globally with a net worth of $100,000 or more, which we define as the premium consumer segment, has increased from 358 million in 2010 to 689 million in 2021, representing a CAGR of 6.1%. We believe our brands and products are positioned as premium products and enable us to capitalize on growth in the number of premium consumers. - _Sustainable Consumption: We believe sustainable consumption is at the forefront of many consumers’ decision whether to engage or transact with a brand. According to a recent third-party survey of U.S. consumers, sustainability is increasingly influencing consumer behavior. We believe the consumer’s focus on sustainable consumption will be a continued trend and that consumers will seek out sustainability minded companies when making purchases.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

As a global group of sports and outdoor brands, we are in a position to encourage more sustainable lifestyles and mindful consumption and promote well-being. While the sports and outdoor industry connects us with nature, it also consumes our planet’s precious resources, and the complex supply chains in our industry are challenging to manage in a responsible way. All this calls for an increased focus on the way we operate today. Together with our brands, we seek to build a sustainability culture that will encourage us all to think bigger, go further and be better. Sustainability is an integral part of our growth strategy. We are determined to pursue growth in a sustainabilityconscious manner. We believe we can do this by integrating sustainability into our operations, from design to supply ----- chain to sales. Our updated sustainability strategy guides this commitment and supports our vision to become a global leader in premium sports and outdoor brands. Our management oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy. Cross-functional operational teams drive our efforts on sustainable business practices, led by the Amer Sports platform with participation across key brands and functions. Working groups plan and execute roadmaps on sustainability initiatives in key areas identified, such as climate change, circular economy, responsible procurement and supply chain, human rights, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We strive to continuously improve our reporting and transparency.

In line with guidance provided by the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), we have identified three key priorities: climate change, circularity and sustainable procurement. - We have committed to set science-based near-term and net-zero emission reduction targets at the group level, which we intend to submit to be validated by the SBTi. Further, Arc’teryx and Salomon have each set brand-level near-term science-based emission reduction targets for 2030 approved by the SBTi. In addition to the net zero 2050 target, the SBTs are expected to include existing targets of reaching 100% of our electricity consumption produced with renewable energy by the end of 2027, and 50% of the purchase volume from our tier 1 and 2 suppliers produced with renewable electricity by the end of 2030. - We are committed to circularity in the design and creation of our products which we believe are built to last and easy to repair, refurbish, or resell. We are also actively exploring new business models and services such as Arc’teryx ReBird™ and Peak Performance WearAgains and sharing best practices across the group. - To promote social sustainability in our supply chain, we expect all our tier 1 suppliers to sign the Amer Sports Ethical Policy, our supplier code of conduct. Our policy is aligned with the FLA Code of Conduct, and addresses employment relationships, child labor, forced labor, harassment and abuse, discrimination, compensation, working hours, and health and safety. We expect that our tier 1 suppliers and nominated tier 2 suppliers will have also conducted social compliance training and annual audits reflecting FLA standards by 2025 in accordance with our contractual requirements. We are also focused on sustainable business practices at the brand level. For example, Arc’teryx opened five new ReBird™ Service Centers in the United States, Canada, Greater China and Japan. ReBird™ Service Centers offer consumers complementary repair services for their Arc’teryx gear, connecting consumers to the brand’s ongoing focus on improving circularity (which promotes the turning of used products into materials for new/repurposed products or otherwise extending such products’ lifespans, as opposed to a linear consumption model where such original products often end up disposed of and treated as “waste”), including upcycling, resale, care and repair. Arc’teryx’s sustainability program, ReCare™, provides consumers with information on home care and field repair for their products, while the ReCut™ program diverts rescued textiles that are repurposed into original and coveted pieces and the ReGear™ program accepts used gear and refurbishes it for sale on the ReGear™ platform. Salomon and Peak Performance have reduced the need for materials and transport by using 3D product samples for sales purposes and is looking to expand the use of 3D in consumer experience and e-commerce. Peak Performance’s second-hand initiative, WearAgains, offers consumers a platform where they can buy and sell pre-owned Peak Performance products, either in-store or on our online marketplace. Salomon developed the ground-breaking Index 0.1 shoe with a differentiated thermoplastic polyurethane outsole which significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions in manufacturing and is designed to be recyclable into ski boot shells. Salomon has renewed its MTN ski touring range to reduce its impact on the environment—with products now produced also with up to 30% biosourced or recycled materials, and the brand’s ADDIKT PRO on-piste ski line is made with recycled ABS sidewalls. In addition, our ski factory in Altenmarkt, Austria drives continued energy efficiency improvements by using local wood chips instead of oil to heat the factory, resulting in a 95% carbon footprint reduction from heating as calculated by a lifecycle assessment using GaBi Databases. We intend to further strengthen our organization and improve our processes, the transparency of our communication, and the scope, reliability, and depth of our data disclosure to be able to meet or exceed our targets. While we recognize the challenge of growing the business without growing the environmental and social impacts, we believe that our strategy, actions and measures can support our journey to sustainable growth. We plan to ----- achieve it together with our differentiated portfolio of leading brands and the many talented people across the global Amer Sports community.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.98,Supply Chain,17.98.1,Sourcing and Manufacturing,"We believe the combination of our owned and sourced manufacturing across different geographic regions provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product procurement. Since our ownership transition in 2019, we have adapted our sourcing practices and supply chain to align with our brand-direct operating model, optimizing our supply chain to provide our brands with a higher degree of autonomy over their individual sourcing and supply chain needs. Sourcing, including vendor selection, is now carried out at the brand level, enabling our brands to be more nimble in their supply chain decision-making. In order to maintain the synergistic benefits of the group’s scale and consistency to group strategy and standards, back-office services, sustainability, oversight, compliance and quality control continue to be carried out by the group’s global sourcing team, including relevant human resources, finance and IT services. To further leverage our diversified setup and scale, we develop and facilitate communications across all brands, in the areas of quality control, sustainability, supply chain management and materials sourcing. This dynamic allows us to have oversight over the various brands, promoting and managing adherence to our Code of Conduct and Ethical Policy, while realizing cost savings from both a scale and operational perspective. In 2022, approximately 81% of our products were sourced from a network of third-party strategic suppliers, with approximately 60% of such products sourced from Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China), approximately 36% from Greater China, approximately 2% from EMEA, and approximately 2% from the Americas. We have a diversified sourcing network, with no single tier 1 supplier accounting for more than 20% of total supply in 2022. Our sourced manufacturing agreements are generally on a fixed price purchase order basis which renew annually. Several of our hard goods products, such as ski boots and bindings, baseballs bats and baseballs, are produced at owned manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Europe. We source the raw materials for our owned manufacturing on generally the same terms as our contracts with sourced manufacturers. We have multiple sources for most of our materials and components of our products, but rely on a small number of sole source suppliers, such as for Gore-Tex, which is used in our Arc’teryx, Salomon, Peak Performance and Atomic products. Key raw materials used in our supply chain include synthetic fabrics and natural products, including blend fabrics, nylon, polyester, down and cotton, as well as plastics, rubber, carbon and metals. In making decisions about the location of suppliers and manufacturing operations, we consider a number of factors including the raw material source, the final destination, production lead times, transport lead times, labor cost, product complexity, the ability to pursue upside demand, as well as geopolitical risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We also seek out alternative suppliers and manufacturers in order to manage concentration risk and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions. Where possible, we use at least two suppliers for a given product to reduce supply risk and to promote competition among suppliers on the basis of cost and quality. In peak seasons, our supply chain operations employ approximately 4,400 employees, including approximately 900 contract workers. As many of our brands are shifting quickly to a higher DTC mix, the agility and speed of our supply chain has become an increasingly important competitive factor to our business, as we are more often becoming the final step between our products and the end consumer.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Our extensive distribution network, consisting of third-party as well as Amer Sports owned and leased distribution centers, is shared between the brands, allowing each of them to leverage warehouses globally that ----- processed close to 4 million outbound deliveries and more than 14 million outbound lines in 2022. We directly operate 9 of our 19 distribution centers, and we carefully determine the remaining third-party contracted centers depending on our presence in the region. Our distribution centers are strategically located to provide speed and service to our consumers at efficient costs and supported by a transportation network built on a set of core-carriers for sea, land and air-transport, under defined service-level agreements. In 2022, we shipped almost 90 million outbound units and more than 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (“TEUs”) of sea freight.

Our brands are continuing to develop integrated, multi-channel marketing strategies designed to effectively reach their target consumers. Each brand pursues this strategy through the use of a variety of media channels, including both traditional media channels as well as digital media channels such as display, online video, social media, paid search and influencers, along with engagement with brand ambassadors, including partnerships with professional athletes and professional sports leagues. Our brands also pursue a variety of “grass roots” initiatives to build community engagement leading to interest and word-of-mouth marketing. In addition, by leveraging insights across product offerings, we seek to understand how consumer behavior and expectations are changing. Our brands employ marketing analytics to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and continuously evolve their brand messaging to ensure that they drive relevance with consumers. Certain brands also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with wholesale partners in traditional and digital, including by providing advertising support in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of products. Our brand websites are also designed to enhance consumer understanding of their product offering and help consumers find and buy our products.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amer Sports began an internal restructuring process that included strategically reallocating existing and hiring new employees to support focus areas, such as our DTC channel and expansion in China. Our capability and resource planning is based on an annual people process called Strategy, Structure and Capability Review (SSCR) where we review and ensure sufficient capabilities across our brands and group functions to execute our short- and long-term strategic plans. We align the development ambition of our people with execution of our growth strategy. In addition, over one third of our top 130 executives were hired externally since 2021 to achieve our high-ambition growth strategy. We have also sought to strengthen capability throughout the group across levels in our brands and functions with over 2000 new hires in the past two years. In addition, we have made significant efforts to facilitate learning and development across the company, including through a modern learning management system and leadership development programs within our brands, as well as a group-wide Leadership Academy that we expect to be implemented in 2024. We are committed to providing opportunities for the continuous development and learning of all our people. We believe that engagement needs to be built on a strong understanding and commitment to a shared purpose and values, which we are renewing across our global organization. In 2022, we acquired a state-of- the-art employee engagement survey platform that allows us to regularly and flexibly survey engagement and understand gaps to address them in a systematic way based on scientifically tested drivers of engagement, inclusion and well-being. We strive to provide a workplace that is inclusive, engaging and gives opportunities for growth. We are committed to continuing to promote diversity in the workplace which reflects the global environment in which we operate. Through our ongoing encouragement of a workplace environment where diversity and inclusion are valued, we believe we better serve our consumers and our organization. We continue to believe that different ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds create a stronger and healthier culture and contribute to superior performance. We are also committed to creating an ethical workplace and community, and we always strive to improve. All of our employees are trained in and subject to our company Code of Conduct, which describes how we all put our ----- values into practice every day and sets the standard for the conduct expected by all Amer Sports employees. Further, we expect our whole value chain, from our own operations to our sourcing partners, to adhere to international standards for human and labor rights.

We seek to protect our investment in the development of our brands, designs, technologies, proprietary information and processes, and trade secrets by relying on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, design, and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We rely on our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. As of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 6,175 trademark registrations, and approximately 444 trademark applications, across over 120 different jurisdictions, including the United States, the EU, the PRC, Japan and other major markets. These trademarks include, among others, our principal brands of Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson, Peak Performance, Atomic, ENVE, Armada, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini and EvoShield, and their related logos. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods and services. In addition to our trademarks, as of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 887 domain [name registrations, including Arcteryx.com, Salomon.com, Wilson.com, Peakperformance.com, Atomic.com,](https://arcteryx.com/) [Enve.com, Armadaskis.com, Slugger.com, Demarini.com and EvoShield.com. However, despite our efforts to](https://enve.com/) obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our trademarks, there can be no assurance that these protections will be available in all cases, and our trademarks may be challenged, infringed, misappropriated, circumvented, otherwise violated, declared generic, determined to be dilutive of or infringing on other trademarks or may lapse. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limit our ability to market our brands, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar products or technologies. As of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 480 issued U.S. patents (including design patents), 83 pending U.S. patent applications (including design applications), 672 issued foreign patents (including design registrations), 136 pending foreign patent applications (including design applications) and 142 pending PCT applications relating to technologies, components, materials, features, functionality, and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various of our products. The term of individual patents and design registrations depends upon the legal term for patents and design registrations in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, the term of a design patent is 15 years from the date of grant of the patent, and the ----- term of a similar design registration in foreign jurisdictions may vary. Additionally, in the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent. It may also be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will result in issued patents in any jurisdiction, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have been issued or might be issued in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. We seek to control access to and use of our designs, technologies, trade secrets, proprietary information and processes, and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, and through the inclusion of contractual protections in agreements with employees, contractors, customers and partners. While we seek to enter into confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and non-compete agreements, as applicable, with our employees, contractors and other third parties, we may fail to enter into such agreements with all relevant parties, such agreements may not be self-executing, may be breached, and might not be completely enforceable. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Moreover, we may be subject to claims that such parties have misappropriated the trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties.

The Endorsement Guides provide that an endorsement should reflect the honest opinion of the endorser and cannot be used to make a claim about a product that the product’s marketer could not itself legally make. The Endorsement Guides also stipulate that, if there is a connection between an endorser and the marketer that consumers would not expect and this connection would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, then that connection should be disclosed. Although the Endorsement Guides are advisory in nature and do not operate directly with the force of law, they provide guidance about what the FTC staff generally believes the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) requires in the context of using endorsements and testimonials in advertising. Any practices inconsistent with the Endorsement Guides can result in violations of the FTC Act’s proscription against unfair and deceptive practices. If our advertising claims or claims made by our social media influencers or by other endorsers with whom we have a material connection do not comply with the Endorsement Guides or any requirements of the FTC Act or similar state requirements, then the FTC and state authorities could subject us to investigations and enforcement actions, impose penalties, require us to pay monetary consumer redress, require us to revise our marketing materials or require us to accept burdensome injunctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the National Advertising Division (“NAD”) of the Better Business Bureau administers a selfregulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising. NAD monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competitors and consumers. We may also be subject to various state consumer protection laws, including California’s Proposition 65, which requires a specific warning on any product that contains a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. ----- Many countries and markets outside the United States have similar, and sometimes more stringent, regulations of advertising practices. For example, in the European Union, advertising of products is subject both to general consumer advertising requirements pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC), which imposes a general prohibition on misleading and aggressive advertising and in the PRC, the Advertising Law regulates advertising and puts similar restrictions on such activities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

These include requirements governing product content and labeling, worker health and safety, the handling, manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials and wastes, the discharge and emission of pollutants and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. We could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines or penalties, enforcement actions and other third-party claims and cleanup costs as a result of our failure to comply with, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations or permits required thereunder. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or the relevant conduct was legal at the time it occurred. We are addressing contamination from historical operations in the United States that has been identified at certain of our current or former properties. The ultimate cost at such sites is difficult to accurately predict and we may incur significant additional costs as a result of the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations (including in connection with expansions or renovations of our facilities) at these or other sites in the future. We also are subject to extensive and evolving regulations regarding the manufacturing, processing, distribution, importing, exporting and labeling of our products and their raw materials. In the European Union, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations came into effect in 2007, with implementation rolling out over time. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential restrictions. Since the promulgation of REACH, other countries have enacted or are in the process of implementing similar comprehensive chemical regulations. In addition, California’s Proposition 65 requires companies to place warnings on products sold in California that contain one of approximately 900 chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. The California state attorney general, as well as private citizens, can file lawsuits against companies for alleged failure to comply with Proposition 65; from time to time, we have received such lawsuits regarding certain of our products. Our operations are also subject to regulation in the United States under federal, state and local occupational health and safety standards, as well as occupational health and safety standards applicable to our operations in other jurisdictions. These standards establish certain employer responsibilities, including requirements to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause serious injury or death, certain medical and hygiene standards, licensing and permitting obligations and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Our facilities and operations may be subject to periodic inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration representatives and comparable authorities in other jurisdictions.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.106,Regulatory Matters,17.106.4,Data Privacy and Security,"We are subject to increasingly complex and changing laws, directives, industry standards, rules and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, related to data privacy and security in the United States and around the world that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, transmission, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, retention, availability, integrity and other processing of personal information. In the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the FTC, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, rules and regulations concerning personal information and information security and have prioritized privacy and information security violations for enforcement actions. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, we are subject to the CCPA, which imposes obligations on covered companies that process the personal information of California residents. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California residents regarding data privacy and security, and provides California residents with data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt out of the sale or certain sharing of their personal information, and to request the deletion of their personal information (subject to certain exceptions). The CCPA provides a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information as well as for civil penalties with enforcement capabilities for both the California Attorney General and a new state agency created under the CPRA. The enactment of the CCPA and other state privacy, data protection and cybersecurity laws, rules and regulations is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the United States, which creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), which became effective on July 1, 2023, and Connecticut enacted the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), which became effective on July 1, 2023. The VCDPA, the CPA and the CTDPA have some similarities to the CCPA and introduced new data privacy rights for residents of such states and new operational requirements for covered companies, including consent requirements for the collection of sensitive personal information. At least nine additional states (Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Montana, Delaware, Oregon, Texas and Florida) have passed similar laws, with some scheduled to take effect in 2023 and others in subsequent years, and other states are considering enacting similar such laws. In addition, laws in all 50 states in the United States require businesses to provide notice to consumers (and, in some cases, to regulators) whose personal information has been accessed or acquired as a result of a data breach. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data protection law to which we would become subject if it is enacted. We are also subject to international laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, which apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. For example, in the EEA, we are subject to the EU GDPR and, following the UK’s exit from the EU, we are subject in the UK to the UK GDPR. The EU GDPR and UK GDPR impose strict compliance obligations with respect to our ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal information, including a principal of accountability, the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audits, and the requirement to appoint data protection officers when special categories of personal information, such as health data, are processed on a large scale. Non-compliance with the EU GDPR and UK GDPR may lead to fines for certain violations of up to €20 million or £17.5 million, respectively, or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. However, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate future changes to be made to the EU GDPR (such changes would need to be specifically incorporated by the UK government), which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced an adequacy decision concluding that the UK ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the EU GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal information flows from the EEA to the UK. This adequacy determination will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission renews or extends it and it may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot predict ----- how the UK GDPR and other UK privacy and information security laws, rules or regulations may develop, including as compared to the EU GDPR, nor can we predict the effects of divergent laws and related guidance. Moreover, the UK is currently in the process of reforming its data protection framework. This may lead to future divergence and variance between the two regimes. The EU GDPR and UK GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA and the UK. Legal developments in Europe have created further complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers, in particular in relation to transfers to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, under which personal information could be transferred from the EEA (and the UK) to relevant self-certified United States entities. The CJEU further noted that reliance on the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield) alone for transfers of personal information outside the EEA (and the UK) may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances, and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (the “EU-US DPF”) (a new framework for transferring personal information from the EEA to the United States), having determined that the EU-US DPF ensures that the protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States will be comparable to the protection offered in the EU. However, this decision will likely face legal challenges and ultimately may be invalidated by the CJEU just as the Privacy Shield was. In addition, on October 12, 2023, the UK-US Data Bridge went into effect to operate as an extension of the EU-US DPF to enable the transfer of personal data between the UK and certified entities in the United States. Such Data Bridge could not only be challenged, but also may be affected by any challenges to the EU-US DPF. As a result of changes in the laws, rules and regulations governing cross-border transfers of personal information, we have had to make, and continue to make, certain operational changes, conduct assessments of our data transfer policies and procedures, and update and implement revised standard contractual clauses and other relevant documentation and measures for intragroup, customer and vendor arrangements requiring transfers of personal information outside the EEA and the UK, including to the United States, within required time frames. We may be adversely impacted as the enforcement landscape further develops, and supervisory authorities issue further guidance on international data transfers. Moreover, in the EEA and the UK, national laws transposing the ePrivacy Directive require opt-in consent to place non-essential cookies or tracking technologies on an individual’s device and for direct electronic marketing. In the EEA and the UK, consent must be obtained in accordance with the requirements of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, respectively. These requirements include a prohibition on using pre-checked boxes and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of non-essential cookie or tracking technology. Recent EEA court and regulatory decisions are driving increased attention on cookies and tracking technologies. For example, regulators and courts are increasingly active as a result of actions by NOYB (a not-for-profit privacy activist group), that has issued over 700 draft complaints to European website operators regarding their cookie banners and subsequently referred over 650 complaints to relevant national regulators, noting it aims to seek enforcement on up to 10,000 websites in Europe. In addition to the data protection laws in the United States, the EEA, the UK and various other jurisdictions in which operate, we are also subject to the PRC’s data protection laws. Under the PRC’s Cybersecurity Law, any collection, use, transfer or storage of personal information of an individual through a network by the network operator should be based on the three principles of legitimacy, justification and necessity and requires the consent of the data subject. The rules, purposes, methods and ranges of such collection should also be disclosed to the data subject. The PRC’s Cybersecurity Law requires operators of CIIOs to store personal information and important data collected and generated from the critical information infrastructure within the PRC. On September 14, 2022, CAC, the PRC’s top cybersecurity regulator, released new amendments to the PRC’s Cybersecurity Law for public consultation and if the amendments are passed, the amended law will increase the penalties for violations of cybersecurity obligations under the Cybersecurity Law, in line with those under the Data Security Law and PIPL. Building on this, the PRC’s Data Security Law became effective on September 1, 2021. The primary purpose of the Data Security Law is to regulate data activities, safeguard data security, promote data development and usage, protect individuals and entities’ legitimate rights and interests, and safeguard state sovereignty, state security and development interests. The Data Security Law applies extraterritorially, and to a broad range of activities that involve “data” (not only personal or sensitive data). Under the Data Security Law, entities and individuals carrying out data activities must abide by various data security obligations. For example, the Data Security Law proposes to classify and protect data based on the importance of data to the state’s economic development, as well as the degree ----- of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, or illegally acquired or used. The appropriate level of protective measures is required to be taken for each respective class of data. The Data Security Law also echoes the data localization requirement in the Cybersecurity Law and requires important data to be stored locally in the PRC. Such important data may only be transferred outside of the PRC subject to compliance with certain data transfer restrictions, such as passing a security assessment organized by the relevant authorities. Additionally, on August 20, 2021, the PRC announced the PIPL, which took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL is intended to clarify the scope of application, the definitions of personal information and sensitive personal information, the legality of personal information processing and the basic requirements of notice and consent, among other things. The PIPL also sets out data localization requirements for CIIOs and personal information handlers who process personal information above a certain threshold prescribed by the relevant authorities. The PIPL also includes a list of rules which must be complied with prior to the transfer of personal information outside of the PRC, such as compliance with a security assessment or certification by an agency designated by the relevant authorities or entering into standard form model contracts approved by the relevant authorities with the overseas recipient. Notably, the PIPL, similar to the EU GDPR, applies extraterritorially. On July 7, 2022, the CAC issued Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Data Transfers, which became effective on September 1, 2022. The Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Data Transfers clarifies the security assessment requirement under the PIPL and requires a data handler to apply for the security assessment organized by the CAC under any of the following circumstances before the information is transferred outbound: (i) where a data handler provides important data overseas, (ii) critical information infrastructure operator and personal information handlers who process more than 1 million individuals’ personal information; (iii) where a data handler has cumulatively provided personal information of over 100,000 individuals or sensitive personal information of over 10,000 individuals in total abroad since January 1 of the previous year. Additionally, on November 18, 2022, the CAC and the State Administration of Market Regulation issued the Implementation Rules for Personal Information Protection Certification which apply with immediate effect and which provide important guidance on obtaining a personal information certification for lawful cross-border transfer of personal information under the PIPL. The CAC published the Measures on Standard Contract for Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information, which became effective on June 1, 2023, and the Guidelines on Filing the Standard Contract for the Export of Personal Information on February 24, 2023 and May 30, 2023, respectively. These provide important guidance on relying on the standard contract for transferring personal information out of the PRC and on its filing requirement. As a result of changes in the cross-border data transfer landscape, we have had to and continue to review our existing data protection compliance framework, conduct data mapping exercises, obtain relevant separate consents from individuals, apply for a security assessment with the CAC and enter into standard contracts with our overseas affiliates for transfers of personal information outside of the PRC. In addition to the PRC’s Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law and the PIPL, the relevant government authorities of the PRC promulgated several regulations or released a number of draft regulations for public comments which are designed to provide further implemental guidance in accordance with the laws mentioned above. We cannot predict what impact the new laws and regulations or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the PRC, in particular the Data Security Law or PIPL, or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in the PRC due to their recent enactment and the limited guidance available, particularly on PIPL, which entities are awaiting further guidance on, particularly on the scope of data localization requirement. It is also generally unclear how the laws will be interpreted and enforced in practice by the relevant government authorities. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on our ability to process data.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.5,Note Guarantees,124.5.1,,"The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the indenture initially will be jointly and severally guaranteed by the Parent and those of the Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that are borrowers or guarantors under the Credit Agreement. If any such Subsidiary that is organized outside of the United States or Canada is not able to enter into such Note Guarantee on the Issue Date, the Issuer intends to cause such Subsidiary to provide such Note Guarantee as promptly as practicable thereafter, and the indenture will require the Issuer to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Note Guarantees to be issued within 120 days after the Issue Date; however, no assurance can be given that such Note Guarantees will be granted on a timely basis. Not all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (including the Parent’s Subsidiaries that are required to guarantee the notes but have not yet issued such Note Guarantees), these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, preferred stock and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Parent. As of December 31, 2022, these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries represented 23.0% of the Company’s liabilities, to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated. If any Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) of the Parent that is not the Issuer nor a Note Guarantor (i) provides a Guarantee of any Indebtedness of the Parent or is a guarantor under any syndicated Credit Facility or Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor after the Issue Date, or (ii) becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Credit Agreement, such Restricted Subsidiary will promptly execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to which it will Guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the indenture for so long as the Guarantee in connection with the applicable Indebtedness remains in place. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Subsidiary shall be required to Guarantee the notes if any such Guarantee shall be illegal or unenforceable under relevant law (after taking into account the limitations set forth in the next succeeding paragraph), as determined in good faith by the Issuer. The obligations of each Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or preference under applicable law. In addition, the ----- obligations of any Note Guarantor organized outside of the United States of America and Canada may be limited as necessary or appropriate to (1) comply with applicable law, (2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims or similar matters or (3) avoid a conflict with the fiduciary duties of such company’s directors, contravention of any legal prohibition or regulatory condition, or the material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officers or directors (in each case as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion). Such limitations could be significant and could, depending on the jurisdiction, reduce the obligations of any Note Guarantor organized outside of the United States of America to zero. In addition, the Credit Agreement grants the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement the ability to agree to additional limitations on guarantees under the Credit Agreement in certain circumstances, which if agreed to would also limit the Note Guarantees for so long as the Credit Agreement remains outstanding. You can find detailed information with respect to limitations on the validity and enforceability of a Note Guarantee granted by Note Guarantors organized outside of the United States of America under “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” A Note Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee and its obligations under the indenture: (1) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Note Guarantor, by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or, except in the case of the Parent, a sale or other disposition of all of the Equity Interests of such Note Guarantor then held by the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to a transaction not prohibited by the indenture; (2) if such Note Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the provisions of the indenture, upon effectiveness of such designation or when it first ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, respectively, or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary; (3) in the case of any Note Guarantee issued on the Issue Date (or required but issued thereafter pursuant to the first paragraph above under the caption “—Note Guarantees”), upon the release or discharge of the Note Guarantee by such Note Guarantor in respect of the Credit Agreement, and, in any other case, upon the release or discharge of any Note Guarantee in respect of Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by such Note Guarantor; (4) upon the occurrence of a Fall Away Event; (5) if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described under “— Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or if the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or (6) as provided in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In the Collateral Documents, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions described below or as set forth in the Collateral Documents (including certain limitations and exclusions applicable to non-U.S. Note Guarantors specified in the “Agreed Security Principles” to be set forth in an exhibit to the indenture, in regards to assets of such non-U.S. Note Guarantors), will grant first priority liens or a floating charge (as applicable in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant Note Guarantors) in (collectively, excluding the Excluded Assets, the “Collateral”): ----- (1) 100% of the Capital Stock of certain existing and future wholly owned material subsidiaries of the Issuer or any Note Guarantors, subject to certain limitations, including limiting the pledges of voting Capital Stock of certain Specified Foreign Subsidiaries or FSHCO to 65% of such voting Capital Stock; provided that no pledge agreements shall be required under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Covered Jurisdictions; and (2) substantially all of the other tangible and intangible assets (including, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, fee-owned real property and tangible and intangible personal property such as, among other assets, intellectual property, investment property, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, contract rights, material bank accounts and material intercompany receivables), in each case, that are held by the Issuer or any of the Note Guarantors, to the extent that a security interest is able to be granted or perfected therein after use of commercially reasonable efforts by the Issuer and applicable Note Guarantors. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by New York law and will contain customary provisions for such intercreditor agreements governing priority of claims among secured creditors. See “— Intercreditor Agreement.” While certain of the grantors are incorporated, organized, or have their center of main interest in Austria, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may not contain provisions that typically would be included in similar documents in these local jurisdictions. For example, a typical European intercreditor agreement would address, on a contractual basis, certain European insolvency and restructuring considerations which arise in the absence of consistent statutory provisions in Europe equivalent to the framework under the Bankruptcy Code, including, among others, provisions on standstill on the enforcement of liens on assets and on the making of claims on direct debt obligations and guarantees, release or forced transfer of junior debt claims upon the occurrence of “distressed disposals” during a restructuring or enforcement process and debt purchase options. In addition, the lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents entered into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to the creation and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, charged or assigned, will give it, in certain cases, as a matter of law, junior priority to the rights of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, the first priority lien of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral will be dependent on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that the rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral are secured on a first priority basis and to which the collateral agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are a party. Such agreement may not be recognized in certain jurisdictions. The indenture and the Collateral Documents will exclude certain property from the Collateral (the “Excluded Assets”), including: (1) any lease, license, contract or agreement to which any grantor is a party, and any of its rights or interest thereunder (or, with respect to clause (i), any other asset), if and to the extent that a security interest is prohibited by or in violation of (or would result in a loss of material rights under) (i) any law, rule or regulation applicable to such grantor, or (ii) a term, provision or condition of any such lease, license, contract or agreement (unless such law, rule, regulation, term, provision or condition would be rendered ineffective with respect to the creation of the security interest hereunder pursuant to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code or the Personal Property Security Act (“PPSA”)) or principles of equity); provided, however, that the Collateral shall include (and such security interest shall attach) immediately at such time as the contractual or legal prohibition (or condition causing such violation, breach, termination or loss of right) shall no longer be applicable and to the extent severable, shall attach immediately to any portion of such lease, license, contract or agreement not subject to the prohibitions specified in clause (i) or (ii) above; provided further that the exclusions referred to in this clause (1) shall not include any proceeds of any such lease, license, contract or agreement unless such proceeds result in the consequences described in this clause (1) after giving effect to the first proviso in this clause (1); (2) any Excluded Securities; (3) any “intent-to-use” application for registration of a trademark filed pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1051, prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” pursuant to Section 1(d) of the Lanham Act or an “Amendment to Allege Use” pursuant to Section 1(c) of the Lanham Act with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, ----- that, and solely during the period, if any, in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of any registration that issues from such intent-to-use application under applicable Federal law; (4) any motor vehicles and any other assets subject to certificates of title to the extent that a Lien thereon cannot be perfected by the filing of “all assets” financing statements or similar filings under the UCC, or any other equivalent law, including the PPSA in the applicable grantor’s jurisdiction of organization or, if applicable, where such asset is situated; (5) any letter-of-credit rights (other than any letter-of-credit rights constituting a Supporting Obligation (as defined in the UCC) for a receivable or other Collateral in which the Notes Collateral Agent has a valid and perfected security interest) to the extent that a Lien thereon cannot be perfected by the filing of “all assets” financing statements or similar filings under the UCC or any other equivalent law, including the PPSA in the applicable grantor’s jurisdiction of organization;

(8) any property or assets in circumstances where the cost, burden or consequences (including adverse tax consequences) of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in such property or assets (including on account of any need to obtain consents or approvals, and the effect of the ability of the relevant grantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course), as determined in good faith by the Parent, are excessive in relation to the practical benefit to the holders of the notes afforded in the indenture; provided that, if the Credit Agreement is then outstanding, the same determination is made in respect of the Lien on such assets securing the Credit Agreement; (9) any property constituting or that is the proceeds of aircraft, aircraft engines, satellites, ships or railroad rolling stock (unless any such property or assets are pledged as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement), to the extent that a Lien thereon cannot be perfected by the filing of “all assets” financing statements or similar filings under the UCC or any other equivalent law, including the PPSA in the applicable grantor’s jurisdiction of organization or, if applicable, where such asset is situated; (10) any real property or real property interest with a Fair Market Value of no greater than $50.0 million (unless any such real property is pledged, charged or assigned as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement) or that is located in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards; (11) any governmental or regulatory license or state, provincial, municipal or local franchise, charter, consent, permit or authorization to the extent the granting of a security interest therein is prohibited or restricted thereby or by applicable Requirements of Law; provided however, that any such asset will only constitute an Excluded Asset under this clause (11) to the extent such prohibition or restriction would not be rendered ineffective pursuant to applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC of any relevant jurisdiction, the PPSA or other similarly applicable law; provided further that the exclusions referred to in this clause (11) shall not include any proceeds of any such license, franchise, charter, consent, permit or authorization unless such proceeds independently constitute an Excluded Asset; (12) any asset or property (including Capital Stock) the grant or perfection of a security interest in which would result in material adverse tax or regulatory consequences to any grantor or any of its subsidiaries as determined by the Parent in good faith; provided, that this clause (12), as related to material adverse tax consequences, shall not apply to any asset or property that is owned by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on the Issue Date and that is not an Excluded Asset on the Issue Date (determined without regard to this clause (12) or to the extent such asset or property remains as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement); (13) Rule 3-16 Capital Stock (as defined below); ----- (14) so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any asset that is not pledged, charged or assigned to secure obligations arising in respect of the Credit Agreement (whether pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (and any related documents) or as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or otherwise);

and (18) any commercial tort claim involving a claim of less than $25.0 million (as determined in good faith by the Parent). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in addition to other exceptions and limitations described in the Collateral Documents, and notwithstanding any action described below that is taken in favor of the Credit Agreement, it is agreed and understood that (i) none of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor will be required to (x) take any action to grant or perfect a security interest in any asset located outside of a Covered Jurisdiction or (y) execute any security agreement, pledge agreement, mortgage, deed, charge or other collateral document governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than a Covered Jurisdiction, (ii) none of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor will be required to take any action to perfect a security interest in the Collateral in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the Issuer or such Note Guarantor is organized or, in the case of a security interest in equity, a Covered Jurisdiction, (iii) none of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor will be required to take any action to perfect any lien with respect to (x) any vehicle or other asset subject to a certificate of title, or any retention of title, extended retention of title rights, or similar rights and/or (y) letter-of-credit rights, in each case to the extent that a security interest therein cannot be perfected by filing a financing statement under the UCC (or similar filings in foreign jurisdictions) without the requirement to list any VIN, serial or other number, (iv) mortgages shall only be required in respect of fee-owned real property with a fair market value in excess of $50.0 million (a) as of the Issue Date, with respect to any such property owned by the Issuer or any Note Guarantor as of the Issue Date, or (b) as of the date of acquisition thereof, with respect to any such property acquired by the Issuer or any Note Guarantor after the Issue Date and, in the case of any such property located in the United States, so long as such property is not located in a flood hazard area, (v) landlord waivers, estoppels, collateral access agreements or similar rights and agreements shall not be required, (vi) the creation or perfection of any security interests through or by “control” (including control agreements) shall not be required with respect to any Collateral (other than in respect of certain material intercompany debt owing to the Issuer or any Note Guarantor (if applicable) and certificated equity interests to the extent otherwise required to be pledged, charged or assigned) and (vii) the Collateral shall not include any property for which the burden or cost (including adverse tax or regulatory consequences) of obtaining or perfecting a security interest therein would outweigh the benefit to the holders of the notes as determined in good faith by the Parent, so long as, in the case of clause (8), such property does not constitute collateral for the Credit Agreement (this paragraph, the “Perfection Requirements”). The Collateral of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor organized in a Covered Jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada shall also be subject to customary “Agreed Security Principles” to be set forth in an exhibit to the indenture. Additionally, (i) no action shall be required to create or perfect a Lien in any asset in respect of which the creation or perfection of a security interest therein would (1) be prohibited by enforceable anti-assignment provisions set forth in any contract directly relating to such asset (at the time of acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation thereof (except if contemplated in connection with any licensing arrangement permitted hereunder)) that is permitted or otherwise not prohibited by the terms of the indenture, (2) violate the terms of any contract directly relating to such asset (at the time of acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation thereof (except if contemplated in connection with any licensing arrangement permitted hereunder)) that is permitted or otherwise not prohibited by the terms of the indenture, in each case, after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law or (3) trigger termination of any contract directly relating to such asset (at the time of acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation thereof (except if contemplated in ----- connection with any licensing arrangement permitted hereunder)) that is permitted or otherwise not prohibited by the terms of the indenture pursuant to any “change of control” or similar provision (in each case after giving effect to any applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other applicable law), it being understood that the Collateral shall include any proceeds and/or receivables arising out of any contract described in this clause (other than Excluded Assets) to the extent the assignment of such proceeds or receivables is expressly deemed effective under the UCC or other applicable Requirements of Law notwithstanding the relevant prohibition, violation or termination right, (ii) neither the Issuer nor any Note Guarantor shall be required to create or perfect a security interest in any asset to the extent the creation or perfection of a security interest in such asset would (A) be prohibited under any applicable Requirements of Law, after giving effect to any applicable anti-assignment provision of the UCC or other applicable law and other than proceeds thereof to the extent that the assignment of such proceeds is effective under the UCC or other applicable Requirements of Law notwithstanding such Requirements of Law and/or (B) require any governmental consent, approval, license or authorization (unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been obtained), after giving effect to any applicable anti-assignment provision of the UCC or other applicable law and other than proceeds thereof to the extent that the assignment of such proceeds is effective under the UCC or other applicable Requirements of Law notwithstanding such consent or restriction, (iii) any joinder or supplement to the indenture, any Note Guarantee, any Collateral Document, any intercreditor agreement and/or other document executed by any Restricted Subsidiary that is required to become a Note Guarantor pursuant to the section “—Note Guarantees,” include such amendments as may be necessary to qualify any representation or warranty set forth in any such document to the extent necessary to ensure that such representation or warranty is true and correct to the extent required thereby or by the terms of any other such document and (iv) (A) none of the Issuer nor any Note Guarantor will be required to take any action required under the Federal Assignment of Claims Act or any similar law and (B) no Person with a security interest in the Collateral will be permitted to exercise any right of setoff in respect of any account maintained solely for the purpose of receiving and holding government receivables. Further, the indenture and the Collateral Documents will not require the Note Guarantors to perfect a security interest in certain other collateral, including any asset if such asset does not constitute “Collateral” (or equivalent term) under the Credit Agreement security documents or where the Issuer and the Note Guarantors are not required to take such actions under the Credit Agreement security documents. The Agreed Security Principles will provide the amount recoverable in respect of the Collateral provided by the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will be limited as necessary to (1) prevent such Collateral from being in breach of any applicable law, (2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims or similar matters or (3) avoid a conflict with the fiduciary duties of such company’s directors, contravention of any legal prohibition or regulatory condition, or the material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officers or directors, in each case as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion. Such limitations could significantly impact the amounts recoverable upon the exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” In certain jurisdictions, a security interest in certain assets can be pledged to or perfected with respect to (as applicable) one secured party only pursuant to local laws governing such collateral or local practice applicable to such collateral. The Credit Agreement Collateral Agent holding a lien on such assets may not be acting as agent with respect to such collateral under such local laws for the benefit of the noteholders and therefore the noteholders may not have a lien on such assets, and in such case the indenture will not require the Issuer and the Note Guarantors to grant liens on such assets, or require the entry into of any joint or common agency or similar arrangement. In certain jurisdictions, the security over the Collateral that (if and when granted) will constitute security for the obligations under the notes and the indenture related thereto will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes but only in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, as beneficiaries of parallel debt or analogous obligations, or “parallel debt. Subject to the foregoing and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if applicable, if property that is intended to be Collateral is acquired by the Issuer or a Note Guarantor (including property of a Person that becomes a new Note Guarantor) and is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the Collateral Documents, then the Issuer or such Note Guarantor will provide a lien over such property consistent with the liens granted over similar property in the applicable jurisdiction (or in the case of any jurisdiction where no liens were previously granted, to the extent customary and reasonably achievable under applicable local law) (or, in the case of a new Note ----- Guarantor, such of its property consistent with the liens granted over similar property in the applicable jurisdiction (or in the case of any jurisdiction where no liens were previously granted, to the extent customary and reasonably achievable under applicable local law)) in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and deliver certain certificates and opinions in respect thereof, all as and to the extent required by the indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Documents. As set out in more detail below, subject to certain exceptions, upon an enforcement event, bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceeding, proceeds from the Shared Collateral will be applied to satisfy obligations under the Credit Agreement and under the notes and under additional first lien debt that may be issued in the future that is subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement on a pari passu basis. In addition, the indenture will permit the Issuer and the Note Guarantors to create additional Liens under specified circumstances. The Collateral (1) has been pledged to Wilmington Trust (London) Limited (in such capacity, and together with its permitted successors, the “Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”) on a first priority basis, for the benefit of the secured parties under the Credit Agreement to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement and (2) subject to certain exceptions, will be pledged to the Notes Collateral Agent, on a first priority basis, for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes to secure the obligations under the notes. Certain of the Shared Collateral that has already been pledged to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will, pursuant to certain laws governing such Collateral, not be capable of being pledged with same priority to the Notes Collateral Agent and will by way of being pledged later in time rank junior to the existing security granted to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent. However, proceeds from enforcement of such Collateral are intended to be distributed amongst the relevant secured parties in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees—Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Shared Collateral, the representative of the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive right to control actions (including the exercise of remedies) with respect to the Shared Collateral. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary provisions for a New York (U.S.) law intercreditor agreement, but will not contain any provisions that seek to address European, Canadian or other nonNew York (U.S.) law insolvency and restructuring considerations typically available in European, Canadian or other non-New York (U.S.) law intercreditor agreements.” To the extent that Liens (including Permitted Liens), rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by the Issuer or the Note Guarantors, including the Collateral, such third parties may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the holders of the notes to realize or foreclose on Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is generally prohibited from foreclosing upon, repossessing or taking control of its security from the debtor in the subject case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed without prior court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). See also “Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” In view of the broad powers of U.S. bankruptcy courts, and the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring proceeding (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through “adequate protection” or otherwise. ----- Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court in a U.S. bankruptcy case determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and all other pari passu secured debt, the holders of the notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the holders of the notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral.

All references to the First Priority Obligations in this section of the Description of the Notes shall refer only to such First Priority Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” or “Applicable Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative and the Applicable Collateral Agent will on the Issue Date be the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of First Priority Obligations that are obligations under the Credit Agreement and (2) the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable ----- Authorized Representative will be the representative of the Series of First Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Priority Obligations as such representative is notified by the Issuer. As of the Issue Date, the Trustee for the notes shall be deemed to be the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and shall remain the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative until such time as it is notified in writing by the Issuer or the Applicable Authorized Representative that another representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative. The Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a prompt written notice to the Trustee and the Applicable Authorized Representative upon any such determination, it being understood that the Issuer shall be entitled to rely upon certifications from the applicable representative in making such determination. With respect to any Shared Collateral, no representative of a Series of First Priority Obligations that is not the Applicable Authorized Representative (“Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”) or the Applicable Collateral Agent nor the holders of indebtedness for which any Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is a representative (“Non-Controlling Secured Party”) shall have the right to direct the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent to exercise, or to consent to any exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent, any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared Collateral. Only the Applicable Authorized Representative and/or the Applicable Collateral Agent shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral. In the event of certain enforcement actions by the Applicable Collateral Agent that result in the sale or other disposition of Shared Collateral consisting of Capital Stock of the Issuer or a Note Guarantor or a Parent Entity thereof (other than, with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, any such Parent Entity that is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer or a Note Guarantor) (any such entity, with respect to any first priority lien obligations, a “Disposed Entity”), the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the claims of any first priority lien obligations (whether direct or through a guarantee) will be released against such Disposed Entity and each of its Subsidiaries and all the Liens on the Shared Collateral of such Disposed Entity and its Subsidiaries shall be released; provided that the proceeds of such sale or other disposition shall be applied in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The “Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonApplicable Authorized Representative, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonApplicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of First Priority Obligations, and (b) the receipt by the Applicable Authorized Representative and each other representative of First Priority Obligations (each such representative of First Priority Obligations, a “First Priority Collateral Agent”) of written notice from such Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of First Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Obligations of that Series with respect to which such Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of First Priority Obligations; provided that such event of default shall be continuing at the end of such 180day period; provided, further, that the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative and/or Applicable Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Note Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The Applicable Authorized Representative and the Applicable Collateral Agent will each on the Issue Date be the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, and the Notes Collateral Agent will not have any rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Notes Collateral Agent becomes the Applicable Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party (as such term is defined below) may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral (subject to applicable local law limitations). No Non-Applicable Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will be permitted to contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized ----- Representative or any holders of indebtedness for which the Applicable Authorized Representative is a representative (“Controlling Secured Party”) or any other exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the holders of the notes and secured parties under the Credit Agreement and the holders of any additional first lien debt that may be issued in the future that is subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (the “First Priority Secured Parties”) also agree that they will not question, contest or support any other person in questioning or contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the Applicable Authorized Representative and/or the Applicable Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding of the Issuer (including any adequate protection payments) or any Note Guarantor, or any First Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, then the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any First Priority Collateral Agent or pursuant to such distribution or received by any First Priority Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First Priority Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the First Priority Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each First Priority Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) and each administrative agent (or other equivalent term or role) for any First Priority Obligations; provided that following the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding of the Issuer or any other Note Guarantor, solely for purposes of the waterfall provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any other document with respect to any First Priority Obligation, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest on the First Priority Obligations to be allowed under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law in such bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding, the amount of First Priority Obligations of each Series of First Priority Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law in such bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceeding. The First Priority Secured Parties of each Series agree that the holders of First Priority Obligations of such Series (and not the First Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations), (y) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Shared Collateral securing any other Series of First Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any properties subject to a Mortgage (as defined in the Credit Agreement (or the equivalent provision thereof)) which applies to all First Priority Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Priority Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Priority Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First ----- Priority Obligations or the Collateral Documents governing such First Priority Obligations will be deemed to refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceedings or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral and none of the Applicable Authorized Representative, Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Applicable Authorized Representative, Applicable Collateral Agent or other First Lien Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may challenge or question, or support any other Person in challenging or questioning, in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of any First Priority Obligations of any Series or any first priority security document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any first priority security document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral by the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent. In addition, none of the First Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Collateral Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other First Priority Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the holders of the notes and each other Series of First Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon the earlier of (i) the conclusion of the applicable foreclosure proceeding or other exercise of remedies and (ii) as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Note Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring proceedings, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Note Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-inpossession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code), or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law) or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law), each First Priority Secured Party agrees not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (a) First Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with ----- the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the insolvency or liquidation proceedings; (b) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; (c) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (d) if any First Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_ secure the DIP Financing over any collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its or their representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection agree that they shall not object to any other First Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The First Priority Secured Parties therein acknowledge that the First Priority Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other documents governing the First Priority Obligations, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Priority Secured Parties of any Series. By its acceptance of notes, each holder will be deemed to have consented to the terms of the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform each of the Collateral Documents and First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to which it is a party, binding the holders to the terms thereof.

(f) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts are U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as in effect on the date hereof (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations, official interpretations or administrative authority promulgated thereunder and any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code as in effect on the date hereof (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), and, for the avoidance of doubt, any intergovernmental agreement (and related legislation, rules or practices) implementing the foregoing (taken ----- together, “FATCA”), except to the extent that such Taxes result from a failure of any paying agent to comply with FATCA; (g) with respect to any Taxes imposed by France if such Taxes are imposed solely because a payment is made to a holder or beneficial owner of notes being established, incorporated or acting through an office located in a noncooperative state or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) as set out in the list referred to in article 238-0 A of the French Code Général des impôts, as such list may be amended from time to time or because this payment is made on an account opened in the name of a holder or beneficial owner of notes in a financial institution situated in a non-cooperative state or territory; (h) with respect to any Taxes imposed by France if such Taxes are imposed solely because the Payor is established in France and is required to withhold, declare and pay at source French personal income tax of a holder or beneficial owner of notes being a French tax resident individual chargeable on interests or assimilated incomes yielding under the notes in accordance with article 125 A of the French Code Général des impôts;

The Payor or applicable withholding agent will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor, or the applicable withholding agent, will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor, or the applicable withholding agent, will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy of tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to the Payor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by the Payor. The Payor will deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable prior to the date on which such payments will be made, and the amounts so payable, and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee (or applicable paying agent) to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date. Any such certificate will be delivered a reasonable amount of time in advance of when the payments in question are required to be made. The Payor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the provisions of the indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts. ----- The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the holders or beneficial owners of notes, upon written request of such holder or beneficial owner of notes and certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such holder or beneficial owner in connection with payments made under or with respect to the notes or any Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such holder or beneficial owner after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such holder or beneficial owner would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this paragraph shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the holder or beneficial owner of the notes would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (a) through (j) above or to the extent such holder or beneficial owner received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments. In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will transmit a notice to each holder of notes describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase notes on the date specified in the notice (such date, the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture (or in accordance with the procedures of the depositary) and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted together with an officer’s certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by the Issuer. The paying agent will promptly mail (or transmit by wire transfer) to each holder of notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and upon receipt of written instruction from the Issuer, the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. Management evaluates transactions which could result in a Change of Control ----- from time to time and may engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Parent could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Parent’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) notice of redemption with respect to the notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price, or (3) after giving effect to such Change of Control, (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Change of Control transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, and (iii) the notes have received an Investment Grade Rating from at least two of the Rating Agencies. In addition, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of launching the Change of Control Offer. The provisions under the indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control (including any required notice period) may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes, including after the entry into of an agreement that would result in the need to make a Change of Control Offer. With respect to the notes, in the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, within 60 days of such purchase, all of the holders of the notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all of the notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding three paragraphs will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $300.0 million, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of notes and all holders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer (“Declined Asset Sale Proceeds”), the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Parent may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance. The agreements governing the Parent’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other Indebtedness, including any Credit Facilities, may contain prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. In addition, the exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale may cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes if it experiences a change of control.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Any designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Following the Issue Date, if a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments (calculated after giving effect to any concurrent transactions) owned by the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or under one or more of the clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent’s Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default; provided that such redesignation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness and, if applicable, an incurrence of related Liens by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent of any outstanding Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such redesignation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens are permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and, if applicable, “—Certain Covenants— Liens” (other than clause (14) under the definition of Permitted Liens), calculated, if applicable, on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Unless the Issuer elects otherwise, the Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to have used amounts under an Incurrence-Based Amount then available to the Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary prior to utilization of any amount under a Fixed Amount then available to the Issuer. The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Parent dated such date prepared in accordance with IFRS.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default with respect to the notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (other than any holder that is a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of such notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to ----- conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder providing such Noteholder Direction was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee (i) an officer’s certificate certifying that the Issuer has (x) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) evidence that the Issuer has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee such officer’s certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity and/or security such Directing Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred.

Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of holders required under the indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank; provided that if a Regulated Bank is a Directing Holder or a beneficial owner directing DTC it shall provide a written representation to the Issuer that it is a Regulated Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a holder has a Net Short Position or to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation or determine whether it complies with the provisions of the indenture, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported, verify any statements in any officer’s certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy, staying any remedy or otherwise failing to act in accordance with a Noteholder Direction as provided for herein. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction, or for determining whether any holder has delivered a Position Representation, such Position Representation conforms with the requirements of the indenture or any other agreement or any holder is a Regulated Bank. Each holder by accepting a note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent) shall be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any officer’s certificate or (iv) its duties under the indenture, as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Holders of notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to certain limitations, including the right to be indemnified and/or provided with security to its satisfaction, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the Trustee with respect to the notes in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. ----- The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the notes.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.27,"Book-Entry, Delivery and Form",124.27.1,Depository Procedures,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly ----- or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants. DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect participants. DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. ----- Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the DTC participant acting on its behalf to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures), and the Certificated Notes shall bear appropriate legends indicating the transfer restrictions applicable thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. ----- Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority, responsibility or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice to an ERISA Plan for a fee or other compensation, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the notes by any Plan, fiduciaries should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each Plan should consider the fact that no Transaction Party is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes in connection with the initial offering of the notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes in connection with the initial offering of the notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the notes for any specific purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the DOL has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and/or holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting transactions involving bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting transactions involving insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, respectively, for the purchase and sale of securities, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or ----- renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided _further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the_ transaction. There can be no assurance that any such exemptions will be available, or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied, with respect to the transactions involving the notes. Governmental plans, certain church plans, non-U.S. plans and other plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions described above, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel regarding the potential consequences of an investment in the notes under any applicable Similar Laws before purchasing any notes. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

We intend to take the position that the possibility of such payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). If the IRS takes a contrary position, you may be required to accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury Regulations) determined at the time of issuance of the notes (which is not expected to differ significantly from the actual yield on the notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments based on the comparable yield. In addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable ----- disposition of the notes would be treated as interest income rather than as capital gain.

This discussion also does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances, including any alternative minimum tax consequences, Medicare contribution tax consequences, the application of Section 451 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) with respect to conforming the timing of income accruals to financial statements, as well as differing tax consequences that may apply if you are, for instance: - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a dealer or trader in securities that uses a mark-to-market method of accounting; - holding notes as part of a “straddle” or integrated transaction; - a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - a tax-exempt entity; or - a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your activities. This summary is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this offering memorandum may affect the tax consequences described herein. This summary does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. taxation, or any taxes other than income taxes. You should consult your tax adviser with regard to the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,96,FATCA,96.1,,96.1.1,,"Provisions commonly referred to as “FATCA” impose withholding of 30% on payments of interest on the notes and of gross proceeds of sales or redemptions of the notes to “foreign financial institutions” (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied, or an exemption applies. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). Proposed U.S. Treasury regulations (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them pending finalization) eliminate the withholding requirement on payments of gross proceeds (other than amounts treated as interest). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of FATCA on their investment in the notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The offering of the notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their respective affiliates. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) in the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Issuer and the Note Guarantors have agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum, neither they, nor any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates over which they exercise management or voting control, nor any person acting on their behalf will, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes. The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We have been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. 271 ----- In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-thecounter market or otherwise. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Specifically, affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates act as lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the Issuer and the Company and to persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer and the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In addition, affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers are acting as lenders under our existing credit facilities and the Bilateral Facility, and our existing revolving credit facility, and may receive certain of the proceeds used by the Company to repay outstanding balances under our existing credit facilities and the Bilateral Facility. Affiliates of certain initial purchasers are agents and lenders under the existing credit facilities and New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the Issuer and the Company (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer and the Company. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments. Additionally, if the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge and certain other of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliate may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The audit report covering the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and January 1, 2021, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, contains an explanatory paragraph that states that as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2022, 2021, and 2020 consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct certain misstatements. The registered business address of KPMG is Vasagatan 16, 111 20 Stockholm, Sweden. In connection with the Amer Sports IPO, KPMG completed an independence assessment to evaluate its independence under the SEC and the PCAOB independence rules. During KPMG’s independence evaluation procedures, a service was identified between the KPMG member firm of the KPMG International Cooperative in Bulgaria (“KPMG Bulgaria”) and a controlled subsidiary of the Company that was permissible under the independence rules applicable at the time it was performed but impermissible under the SEC and PCAOB independence rules applicable to audits in connection with this filing. Late in 2022 and in early 2023, KPMG Bulgaria performed clerical assistance in the preparation and filing of a registration in Bulgaria related to the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners of our subsidiary in Bulgaria. This service was exited in April 2023. No fee has been or will be charged for the service rendered or the related costs incurred. KPMG provided the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to our board of directors and the audit committee, including the entity involved, the nature of the service, the period over which the service existed, and the potential fees and actual cost incurred by KPMG Bulgaria. Notwithstanding that the service is an impermissible management function under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, the management of our subsidiary in Bulgaria retained all decision making and ultimate responsibility for the service which was not complex or judgmental in nature. Additionally, the service was not significant to KPMG and our subsidiary in Bulgaria, does not place KPMG in a position of auditing its own work and does not place KPMG in a position of being an advocate for the Company. The Bulgarian operation is not material and is not in scope for the group audit of the Company. Considering the facts presented, our board of directors, the audit committee, and KPMG have concluded (1) that the service does not, did not and will not impair KPMG’s application of objective and impartial judgment on any matter encompassed within KPMG’s audits of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and (2) a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.1,Austria,243.1.1,Insolvency,"The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Austrian insolvency law. The law relating to insolvency is primarily regulated by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) (the “IO”). The IO regulates on the one hand bankruptcy proceedings in which the debtor’s assets or company as a whole are sold and the proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it also provides for recovery proceedings insolvency enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under certain conditions. On top, in case of a likelihood of insolvency (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz), in particular if the relevant company is imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig), restructuring proceedings under the Austrian Restructuring Code may be opened. Creditors' rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency proceedings but regulates the reorganization of companies in financial distress – see further below for details. As to Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Austria (the “Austrian Guarantors”), a rebuttable presumption exists that these entities also have their respective COMI in Austria. Insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Austria in the event of an insolvency of a company having its COMI in Austria, or if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of the Republic of Austria or, where the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) does not apply, also if such company has assets in Austria. Such proceedings will be governed by Austrian law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Austria in accordance with Austrian law with respect to the assets of companies that are not organized under Austrian law. Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) are opened by a court if the debtor is insolvent, provided that the insolvency estate's value is sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings (or an advance payment is made to cover such costs). In a nutshell, a debtor is insolvent in case of illiquidity within the meaning of section 66 IO (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e., the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due) or, if the debtor is a company, also over-indebtedness within the meaning of section 67 IO (Überschuldung) (i.e., the debtor’s liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to continue as a going concern (negative Fortbestehensprognose)). Under Austrian law, insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by the debtor or a creditor by filing an application to that effect with a court of competent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a creditor’s request, such creditor will have to show that the debtor is illiquid or over-indebted and the court as a general rule will hear the debtor. In the event that the debtor is at imminent risk of becoming illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), only recovery proceedings may be initiated and only upon the debtor's request. The debtor is obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay upon insolvency. If it is evident that an insolvency cannot be avoided, the debtor is obliged to file for insolvency immediately. If the debtor undertakes ex ante promising and realistic measures to stabilize or reverse insolvency, the debtor has a maximum period of 60 days to file. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IO has been amended to allow the debtor 120 days to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor’s illiquidity is caused by a natural disaster, which includes pandemics, epidemics, floods, avalanches, snow pressures, landslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, or similar disasters of comparable magnitude. ----- Depending on whether the debtor submits a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) together with the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the initiated proceedings may be in the form of recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren), with or without self-administration (mit oder ohne Eigenverwaltung) or bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren). If it is the debtor that has applied for the initiation of insolvency proceedings as recovery proceedings and has submitted to the court a recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) that offers a recovery rate of at least 20% payable to the unsecured creditors within a maximum period of two years, the court initiates insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings without self administration. If the conditions for recovery proceedings are not met, the insolvency court initiates bankruptcy proceedings. There are additional legal provisions regulating recovery proceedings not applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. A debtor may also submit a recovery plan during bankruptcy proceedings that are already in progress. For the debtor's recovery plan to be approved by the court it should meet certain criteria specified by sections 140 et seq. IO. The purpose of a recovery plan is to enable a debtor to be released from a portion of its debts (not to exceed 80% of the aggregate amount thereof) and to continue its business operations. A recovery plan must be approved by a “qualified majority” of the debtor's unsecured creditors for it to become effective. For the approval of the recovery plan, two majorities must be reached: (i) more than half of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at such hearing must approve the recovery plan and (ii) the creditors voting in favor of the recovery plan must represent more than half of the aggregate amount of all claims of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at such creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung). Once the debtor has complied with the terms of a recovery plan that was duly approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, it will be released from its remaining outstanding unsecured debts. Unsecured creditors whose claims under the recovery plan have not been satisfied in accordance with the plan's terms may enforce their individual claims against the debtor, moreover, the release from debt is usually not fully applicable anymore to these creditors. In case the recovery plan is not approved by the creditors, insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings. If the recovery proceedings have been initiated, the debtor has submitted a recovery plan that offers a recovery rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors over a maximum two-year period after the approval of such recovery plan and some further prerequisites are met, the debtor qualifies for self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren mit _Eigenverwaltung). It is possible that such proceedings are changed and continue in the form of recovery proceedings_ without self-administration and/or (subsequently) bankruptcy proceedings. Other than under restructuring proceedings under the ReO (see below) recovery plans in recovery proceedings do not contain creditor classes; there is, therefore, however, also no cross-class cram-down. Same as with the proceedings under the ReO, the recovery plan cannot interfere with the legal and economic position of shareholders against their will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders. Creditors are not entitled to present their own (competing) recovery plan. Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor is not allowed as of the date of the opening of the insolvency proceedings to dispose of the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). The opening of insolvency proceedings usually takes effect on the day following the publication of the court's order opening such proceedings in the official online database of Austrian insolvencies (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration), transactions of the debtor with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate have no effect against the creditors of the insolvency estate. Certain of the administrator’s actions or transaction require the prior approval of the creditor’s committee (if appointed) or the court. With its decision to open the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor's business (either ex officio or upon the request of the creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung)), appoint a creditors' committee (Gläubigerausschuss) charged with monitoring and assisting the insolvency administrator in the discharge of its duties. After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on behalf of the insolvency estate. Under Austrian law, an insolvency administrator’s role is to continue the debtor’s business with a view to enabling a potential reorganization of the debtor’s business either by implementing the debtor’s recovery plan or by a (partial) sale of the debtor’s business. If neither a recovery plan nor a (partial) sale of the debtor’s business is possible, the insolvency administrator will discontinue the debtor’s business operations (or parts of it). As a result of A 2 ----- the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor's assets will be liquidated and the proceeds realized thereby will be distributed to the debtor's creditors, with the debtor remaining liable for any portion of its debts not satisfied by such proceeds. If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will proceed with the appointment of a recovery administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are either subject to the recovery administrator’s approval or may be performed only by the recovery administrator. Again, certain actions or transactions may also require the prior approval of the creditor’s committee (if appointed) or the court. Unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) wishing to assert their claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and must file their claim with the competent court within the period set out in the court order opening the insolvency proceedings. At the respective hearing (examination hearing (Prüfungstagsatzung)), the insolvency administrator must declare whether it acknowledges or contests each of the claims filed with the court. If the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor’s claim, such creditor will be entitled to participate in the insolvency proceedings and the pro rata distribution to unsecured creditors that will follow. If a creditor’s claim is contested by the insolvency administrator, the creditor will have to seek enforcement of its claim in civil proceedings and only then participate in the insolvency proceedings. Claims of unsecured creditors which were created before the opening of the insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzforderungen) rank pari passu among themselves. Certain claims which lawfully arose against the insolvency estate after the opening of the insolvency proceedings (privileged claims (Masseforderungen)) enjoy priority in insolvency proceedings. Claims which are secured by in rem security, such as pledge over shares (preferential claims (Absonderungsrechte)), are entitled to preferential payment in the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the realization of the charged asset. Creditors who have a right to preferential treatment may participate in the pro rata distribution to the unsecured creditors to the extent that the proceeds from the realization of the assets charged to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right with respect to the approval of the recovery plan to the extent their claim is covered by security. Claims relating to the payment of taxes, social security contributions and employee compensation are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian law. The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during such proceedings constitute privileged claims (Masseforderungen) and rank prior to all other unsecured claims (Insolvenzforderungen). Claims of creditors with a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte), such as creditors with a retention of title or trustors (Treugeber), remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings. According to the IO, a request for preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets of a debtor that are essential for the continuation of the debtor’s business cannot be made within a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, unless, inter alia, the preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages. Once insolvency proceedings have been opened it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are subject to an automatic stay (Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the last 60 days prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings expire upon the opening of such insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exemptions), unless the insolvency proceedings are terminated due to lack of funds to cover the cost of such proceedings. Execution liens obtained within the last twelve months may be subject to voidance law. According to the IO (and subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions), for a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractual counterparties of the debtor may terminate contracts only for good cause. In this context, the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of timely performance by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered a good cause allowing a termination. This restriction only applies if a termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation of the debtor's business. No restrictions apply if a termination of a contract is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages. Furthermore, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement or for an automatic termination in the event of opening of insolvency proceedings against the other party is not enforceable (again, subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions). A 3 ----- Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.1,Austria,243.1.2,Reorganization Proceedings,"The Austrian Business Reorganization Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) (the “URG”) governs reorganizations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress to continue to do business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act is therefore not designed to assist creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization of the debtor’s enterprise. A reorganization procedure may be opened if there is no insolvency in place and a substantial and sustainable deterioration of the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) may be certifiably anticipated. Only the debtor may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is not insolvent at the time of its application. Failure to timely apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings may result in personal liability of the representatives of the relevant corporation. A presumption for the need of reorganization (Vermutung _des Reorganisationsbedarfs) relevant for the opening of a business reorganization procedure is in place if the_ following criteria are met: a quota of own funds (Eigenmittel) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years, each as defined in, and determined in accordance with, the URG. Pursuant to section 19 of the URG, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement, for its automatic termination or the maturity of a disbursed loan facility in the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings relating to the other party is (subject to certain exemptions for derivatives and other financial transactions) not enforceable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.1,Austria,243.1.3,Restructuring Proceedings,"The Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung, “ReO”) is based on the Restructuring Directive for the right of an entrepreneur (except for certain companies in the financial sector, such as credit institutions and public bodies) to voluntarily file for the opening of restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) where there is a likelihood of insolvency (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz), in particular where the relevant company is imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). The likelihood of insolvency is presumed where the criteria for the opening of a business reorganization procedure under the URG (see above) are met. Creditors cannot file for the opening of restructuring proceedings. The primary objective of the ReO is the approval of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) by the majority of the creditors of the debtor in each class (see below). Such restructuring plan which shall ensure the solvency of the debtor needs to be submitted by the debtor. Creditors are not entitled to present their own (competing) plan. Under certain circumstances, the court may confirm the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), even if the qualified majority is not reached in each class (cross-class cram-down). This cram-down possibility is aimed at finally removing the disruptive potential of hold-out creditors outside of insolvency proceedings. Amongst others, the exercise of rights as well as their enforcement, may be limited under the ReO. For example, and without limitation, (i) upon the acceptance and confirmation of a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) claims may be restructured (for example by way of a payment deferral (Stundung) or a reduction in the value of the relevant claims (Forderungskürzung)), subject to certain preconditions to be met, even without the consent of or against the affected creditors, (ii) the ReO allows for a stay of individual enforcement actions (Vollstreckungssperre) during restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) for a period of three up to a maximum of six months and (iii) during restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) it is not allowed, subject to certain prerequisites to be met and exemptions (e.g. for derivatives and other financial transactions), to withhold performance or terminate, accelerate or, in any other way, modify essential contracts yet to be performed (wesentliche noch zu erfüllende Verträge) to the detriment of the relevant debtor by virtue of a contractual clause providing for such measures, solely by reason of, for instance, the opening of restructuring proceedings or meeting the pre-requisites for the opening of restructuring proceedings. The ReO provides for five different possible creditor classes in restructuring proceedings: (i) secured creditors, (ii) unsecured creditors, (iii) bondholders, (iv) particularly vulnerable creditors (with claims below Euro 10,000) and (v) subordinated creditors. A 4 ----- Shareholders are subject to a general obligation not to unreasonably prevent restructuring measures. However, shareholders cannot form a class in a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), with the consequence that there is no possibility to outvote shareholders in a cross-class cram-down. Therefore, a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) cannot interfere with their legal and economic position against their will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders. New or interim financing as well as other transactions closely related to the restructuring (especially those necessary for the continuation of the business) shall only be subject to limited avoidance actions in possible subsequent insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, avoidance protection applies if the opposing party did not know about the debtor's illiquidity. The ReO also provides for a simplified fast-track restructuring procedure that can be used by the debtor if only financial creditors will be subject to the proposed restructuring measures. In such simplified proceedings, the debtor remains entirely in possession (no restructuring expert will be appointed). Further, creditors do not need to vote on a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan) in a court hearing. Instead, the debtor submits to the court a restructuring agreement that has already been signed by at least a 75% majority in value of each financial creditor class (no majority based on headcount is required). Ultimately, such restructuring agreement can be sanctioned by the court without the initiation of formal restructuring proceedings. Thus, it is also not possible to apply for an enforcement stay in these fast-track proceedings. A cross-class cram-down will most likely not be possible in such proceedings. Restructuring proceedings pursuant to the ReO, which do not qualify as European restructuring proceedings (Europäisches _Restrukturierungsverfahren), are not published in publicly available registers or data bases.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

This might particularly be the case if insolvency proceedings were opened against an issuer with its COMI in the Republic of Austria (see the explanation of COMI above). Following this, in general and with regard to the scope of the representation by the curator, the respective holders of such partial debentures may not exert their rights arising out of the partial debentures on their own, as such rights are then exerted by the curator; however, they are in general entitled to accede the respective legal proceedings initiated by the curator against the issuer as intervenor (Nebenintervenient).

It in particular stipulates that a loan (understood in a broad sense) granted by a (direct or indirect) shareholder in a financial crisis (i.e., the subsidiary is (i) illiquid, (ii) over-indebted (both in the meaning of the IO) or (iii) the quota of own funds (Eigenmittel) is less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) is more than 15 years, both as defined in, and determined in accordance with, the URG) is deemed to be equity replacing. Equity replacing shareholder loans must not be repaid as long as the crisis subsists and any security interest granted in connection with such loans must not be enforced. This means, in particular, that in an insolvency of the subsidiary, the respective claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated (i.e., there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) or a right for separate satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) for such claims). A shareholder is defined to be, inter alia, (i) a shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person not holding a participation in the borrower but having a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) regarding the borrower. Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as shareholder, inter alia, if (i) it holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the borrowing company which allows a dominant influence (beherrschenden _Einfluss) regarding the borrowing company (indirect controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a_ participation in the borrowing company of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation of at least 25% in the borrowing company. A 5 ----- Also the granting of security can be subject to equity substitution, if a shareholder guarantees the repayment of a third party’s loan, creates a pledge or provides comparable collateral at a time when the granting of a loan would replace equity; in such case the third party may satisfy its claims from the collateral without having to take action against the company first. As long as the crisis subsists the shareholder’s possibilities for recourse towards the company are limited. Details are provided in sections 15, 16 of the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements. Prior to the enactment of the Act on Equity Replacements, the Austrian Supreme Court had developed even stricter rules on equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear whether, in addition to the provisions of the Act on Equity Replacements, such rules (or certain of its rules) developed by the Austrian Supreme Court are still applicable/relevant and would be applied by Austrian courts. In this context, it must also be noted that it is uncertain whether the rules on equity substituting shareholder loans also apply to “a-typical pledgees” (atypische Pfandgläubiger). The details are unclear and it is also unclear under what circumstances a secured lender may qualify as a-typical pledgee.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

These rules protect the assets of the Austrian Guarantors for the benefit of their respective creditors. The entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the registered share capital, is protected by Austrian capital maintenance rules. Austrian capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited partnerships of which the general partner/s is or are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders in circumstances other than as a distribution of profits (if, to the extent and as long as available for distribution under Austrian law), by a reduction of share capital or as liquidation surplus on liquidation of that corporations. Guarantees or providing of collateral by an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited liability partner of which is a corporation) in order to guarantee or otherwise secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian subsidiary were not for the Austrian subsidiary's corporate benefit (betrieblich _gerechtfertigt). Austrian corporate law does not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt) must be tested at the level of the individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit solely for the group (but not_ for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be sufficient. Any transaction that violate Austrian capital maintenance rules are null and void. This nullity may also affect third parties (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules. Therefore, in order to enable Austrian subsidiaries to provide a guarantee or any other form of collateral with respect to liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company and in order to reduce the risk of violating Austrian capital maintenance rules and the resultant invalidity and unenforceability, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Austria (see Capital Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language). Pursuant to such limitation language, the grant of collateral and the provision of upstream and sidestream guarantees of Austrian subsidiaries are limited to the extent required to avoid a breach of the Austrian capital maintenance rules. However, such limitation language is not capable of making guarantees or securing of liabilities permissible in general. No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether the limitations set forth in the indenture entered into by Austrian Guarantors, in particular regarding the limitation of the amount guaranteed to an amount permitted under Austrian capital maintenance rules, would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the Guarantees or any other form of collateral to the extent possible or whether the Guarantees or any other form of collateral could be deemed void in their entirety. Moreover, Austrian capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions, and it cannot be ruled out that future court rulings may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of subsidiaries incorporated in Austria and constituted in the form of a corporation or of a limited partnership the general partner or general partners of which is or are corporations. A 6 ----- _Capital Maintenance Rules – Limitation Language_ The limitation language for any Austrian Guarantor to be incorporated into in the indenture and / or guarantees, will substantially be in the form as follows: The obligations (Verpflichtungen) and liabilities (Haftungen) of a Guarantor incorporated in Austria (“Austrian",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.2,"Guarantor”) under or in connection with this Agreement, shall at all times be limited so that at no time the",243.2.1,,"assumption of an obligation and/or liability under this Agreement would violate or contradict Austrian capital maintenance rules (Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian company law, in particular, without limitation, section 52 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Stock Corporations (Aktiengesetz – AktG) (and for the avoidance of doubt including section 66a AktG), section 82 of the Austrian Act on Limited Liabilities Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung – GmbHG) or any analogous application thereof (the “Austrian",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.3,Capital Maintenance Rules”).,243.3.1,Stamp Duty,"Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Gebührengesetz) (the “GebG”), ad valorem stamp duty is triggered upon the creation of a document (Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the GebG) on certain stampable transactions enumerated in the GebG. Stampable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements, sureties, assignments, mortgages. According to the GebG, stamp duty on, e.g., (a) sureties (Bürgschaften) as well as assumptions of liabilities as joint debtor (Schuldbeitritt) amounts to 1% of the secured amount (depending on the wording of a guarantee, a guarantee may be treated as a surety or as assumption of liabilities for stamp duty purposes); and (b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in a case of an assignment for security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the lower of either the secured amount or the value of the assigned receivables. Stampable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt from stamp duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures the credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (section 20(5) of the GebG). As a general rule, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a stampable transaction is created in Austria and such transaction is not exempt from stamp duty. A 9 ----- Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a document on a stampable transaction outside of Austria may trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may thus be triggered for a document created outside of Austria if (i) the parties to the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat, place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria (place of performance within Austria). If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into or sent to Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria. Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a stampable transaction in a qualified manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third party to furnish proof of the underlying transaction). Furthermore, stamp duty may be triggered by a so-called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a stampable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document on a (concluded) stampable transaction. If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the GebG generally the parties to the transaction are jointly and severally liable for Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to performance (e.g. a surety), the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary of a surety) (section 28(1) of the GebG). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is not duly notified of the stampable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if triggered are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honoured by the tax authorities within their discretion. If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a stampable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to 100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the GebG have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly. _Enforcement of Judgments_ According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), foreign judgments are only enforceable if reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by an ordinance (Verordnung) of the Austrian government (in which ordinance the Austrian government confirms the reciprocity). The Republic of Austria and the United States have not entered into a treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered in either state's courts, other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters. There is also no applicable ordinance of the Austrian government in place. As such, the courts of Austria will not recognize and/or enforce a judgment obtained in the courts of the United States being a judgment rendered by a United States federal or state court. Accordingly, the subject matter upon which a judgment has been obtained in a United States federal or state court must be re-litigated before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian civil procedure laws (Zivilprozessverfahren). Only after having obtained a final judgment before Austrian courts can enforcement procedures be initiated under the Austrian Enforcement Act.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

To the extent any such obligation or liability of an Austrian Guarantor infringes or contradicts Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, such obligation or liability shall be deemed to be replaced by an obligation or liability of a similar nature which is in compliance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and the payment obligations shall be limited to the maximum amount permitted to be paid in accordance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and provides the best possible security interest. If and to the extent the assumption or enforcement of any (payment) obligation or liability by an Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement could result in a risk to any officer of that Austrian Guarantor of civil liability or criminal responsibility because of a violation of Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, the amount then payable in respect of such obligation or liability shall be reduced to the maximum amount then permissible to be paid without triggering such risk. The Parties acknowledge that the limitations set out in this Agreement may have the effect of reducing any payment permissible at a given time by an Austrian Guarantor under this Agreement to zero. _Limitations on Enforcement – Regulatory Approvals_ Enforcement of the pledges over the Shares in the Austrian Guarantors or even the exercise of voting rights by the Security Agent ahead of such enforcement may be conditional on certain approvals, including approvals under applicable merger control laws and foreign direct investment laws. _Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt_ Certain security interests such as pledges under Austrian law are accessory rights (akzessorisches Rechte) and will therefore be subject to the same legal consequences as the secured obligations; if the secured obligations are terminated or not valid, the same applies to the security interest. The security interest cannot be separated from the secured obligations, which means that it can only be held and enforced by the creditor of such secured obligations. Due to their accessory nature, pledges will cease by operation of Austrian law upon payment (or other discharge) of the secured obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent for the purpose of the Security Agent being able to hold the Collateral. Pursuant to such parallel debt obligations, the Security Agent is an independent and separate creditor, acting on behalf of itself and the secured parties, in respect of each and every claim under the notes and the indenture. While parallel debt obligation are market standard and believed to be recognized (if effective under their governing law), they are untested before the Austrian courts, and no assurances can be given that parallel debt will be recognized in accordance with its terms by the Austrian courts. _Hardening Periods and Clawback_ Under the voidance rules of the IO, an insolvency administrator may, by action of voidance or by defense of voidance, under certain circumstances, challenge any transaction (which term for the purposes of this section “Hardening periods and clawback” includes, without limitation, the granting of security and the guaranteeing, A 7 ----- assuming and/or paying of debt). In particular, the following transactions are voidable with respect to the debtor’s creditors: - Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht), section 28 no 1 – 3 IO: All transactions (Rechtshandlungen) performed or entered into by the debtor within ten years prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent known to the other party to discriminate against its creditors as well as all transactions through which the debtor’s creditors are discriminated against and which it performed or entered into during the last two years prior to commencement of insolvency proceedings, provided that the beneficiary of the transaction should have been aware of such intent. If the legal act was concluded with or for the benefit of certain connected persons (as defined by law) the burden of proof regarding the knowledge of the intention to discriminate is shifted to that connected person, i.e., the connected person must prove that they had no knowledge and was not negligent in having no knowledge, respectively. Should the debtor be a legal entity capable of being a party in a lawsuit, then members of the managing and supervisory bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's shareholders with unlimited liability and the debtor's controlling shareholder or shareholders within the definitions of the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) are deemed to be connected. - Voidance due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung), section 28 no 4 IO: Delivery, purchase and barter transactions undertaken by the debtor in the last year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings are voidable, if the other party perceived or should have perceived the intent to discriminate against the debtor’s creditors through transactions below market value. - Voidance of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung unentgeltlicher _oder ihnen gleichgestellter Verfügungen), section 29 IO: In particular, transactions of the debtor without_ consideration (except customary occasional gifts and transactions for a reasonable and proportionate amount towards a charitable cause or for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, a moral duty or consideration of decency) and acquisitions of property from the debtor by order of authority if paid out of the debtor’s funds are voidable, if performed or entered into in the last two years prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. - Voidance due to preferential treatment (Anfechtung wegen Begünstigung), section 30 IO: Security or payment (Sicherstellung oder Befriedigung) given to a creditor after the occurrence of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung), both within the meaning of the IO, or after filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or in the last 60 days before such filing/insolvency is voidable, if (i) the creditor obtained a security or payment it was not entitled to or not entitled to in this particular manner or at that particular time, (ii) the security or payment was given to persons who were aware or should have been aware of the intent of the debtor to treat them preferential ahead of the debtor's other creditors, or (iii) the transaction was effected for the benefit of a connected person, unless such connected person (as defined by law, see above) did not know and should not have known about the debtor's intention to give preferential treatment. A grant of security or payment under such circumstances is not voidable if the preferential treatment was given more than one year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. - Voidance due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), section 31 IO: Any transaction performed or entered into after the occurrence of the_ debtor's illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) both within the meaning of the IO or after the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings may be challenged if: - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to a connected person (as defined by law, see above), or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with such connected person which is considered to be prejudicial to the debtor's creditors (nachteilige _Rechtsgeschäfte), unless (i) with respect to such payment or granting of security, or to a transaction_ directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, such connected person did not have nor should have had knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) with respect to a transaction indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, the negative effect of such transaction on the insolvency estate was not objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction; A 8 ----- - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to a creditor, or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with a third party which is directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, provided that the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's illiquidity, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; and - entered into by the debtor with a third party which is indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, provided that (i) the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's illiquidity, overindebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) such transaction's negative effect on the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction. Such transaction's negative effect is foreseeable, in particular, when a recovery effort is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich untaugliches Sanierungskonzept). A transaction is considered to be indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar nachteilig) if, even though it may be objectively balanced, i.e., not directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, it nonetheless has a negative effect on the recovery rate of unsecured creditors. Transactions carried out more than six months prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may not be voided due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis _der Zahlungsunfähigkeit)._ The relevant hardening/suspect periods will commence upon the last act of the relevant transaction. Furthermore, the relevant hardening/suspect periods will be extended by the term of a reorganization proceeding if such reorganization proceeding terminates within the relevant hardening/suspect periods. In addition to an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the IO, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any transactions pursuant to the provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action vary to a certain extent from the rules described above, and the voidance periods commence from the date on which such other creditor exercises its voidance rights in court. The most relevant provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung) are: section 439 EO: Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht) and voidance due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung); section 440 EO: voidance of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung unentgeltlicher oder ihnen gleichgestellter _Verfügungen)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In the event of insolvency of a Canadian guarantor, such guarantor may become subject to Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization or similar proceedings and Canadian law would govern those proceedings (“Canadian Insolvency Proceedings”). During Canadian Insolvency Proceedings, creditors may be stayed from exercising their rights and remedies against the debtor company, including in respect of any pre-filing obligations and any security, without prior approval from the court-appointed officer and/or the court supervising the proceedings. Also, pursuant to such proceedings, the debtor may prepare and file a proposal or plan of compromise, reorganization or arrangement for consideration by all or some of its creditors to be voted on by the class or classes of its creditors affected thereby. Such a proposal or plan, as applicable, if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors and if approved or sanctioned by the relevant court, would be binding on all creditors within any such class who may not otherwise be willing to accept such plan or proposal. Moreover, subject to court oversight, in such proceedings the debtor may be permitted to retain possession and administration of its property, including its cash collateral, even though it may be in default under applicable debt instruments and security documents. Further, in such proceedings, the court may, subject to certain conditions and on proper notice, create court-ordered charges on the assets of the debtor to secure new financing, professional fees, post-filing amounts owing to critical suppliers, statutory director liabilities or other amounts, in priority to the liens that secure the notes or the guarantees, as applicable. The powers of the court in Canadian Insolvency Proceedings have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the notes or the related guarantees, as applicable, would be made following commencement of or during such proceeding, whether or when the holders of the notes could exercise their rights in respect of the notes, related guarantees or security, as applicable, whether and to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, or whether and to what extent claims under the notes or the guarantees, as applicable, could be compromised. A court may also authorize the sale of assets of a debtor company (without a creditor vote) free and clear of any security granted in the assets. Such security interest would continue in respect of the proceeds of sale of the assets in the same priority it enjoyed immediately prior to the court-approved sale. Court-approved sales by receivers are generally treated in the same manner. The guarantees of a Canadian guarantor or security granted by it may be subject to review under applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and winding-up laws relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, transfers at undervalue or similar transactions and applicable provincial and territorial fraudulent conveyance and preference laws and comparable provisions of other applicable laws if a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding or lawsuit is commenced by or in respect of a Canadian guarantor. Under applicable Canadian laws, on application by an interested party, a court could void a Canadian guarantor’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or void the security granted by it, subordinate the guarantee to such Canadian guarantor’s other debt or order another monetary or specific remedy if a Canadian court were to find A 11 ----- that the incurrence of the guarantee or grant of security was a transfer at undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or preference, or other form of impeachable transaction. For example, under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency legislation, a guarantee may be set aside or voided, or ordered that it is not effective as against a trustee in bankruptcy and creditors, if it is established, in the case of a guarantee given to an arm’s length party, that the Canadian guarantor: - became subject to the applicable Canadian Insolvency Proceedings within one year of issuing the guarantee and, at the time it issued the guarantee, it received conspicuously less than fair market value for issuing the guarantee (for example, based on the argument that the guarantee was incurred for the benefit of the Issuer and only indirectly for the benefit of the relevant Canadian guarantor with the result that the obligations of the relevant Canadian guarantor were incurred for undervalue), it was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee, and it intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor; - became subject to the applicable Canadian Insolvency Proceedings within three months of issuing the guarantee and, at the time it issued the guarantee, it was insolvent and it issued the guarantee to a creditor with a view to giving the creditor a preference over another creditor (which is presumed if the effect was to give the creditor a preference, absent evidence to the contrary). Under such legislation, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - it is unable to meet its obligations as they generally become due; - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due; - the aggregate of its assets is not, at fair valuation, sufficient, or if disposed at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing due; or - it is reasonably expected to run out of liquidity within a reasonable proximity of time as compared with the time reasonably required to implement a restructuring. Because fraudulent conveyances and other forms of impeachable transactions in the context of insolvency are also subject to provincial laws, other tests may apply and the extent of review and available remedies will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether an impeachable transaction has occurred. We cannot be sure, depending on the circumstances, that a guarantee or security would not be voided or the guarantee would not be subordinated to the Canadian guarantor’s other debt. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or other form of impeachable transaction has occurred in respect of the guarantee or security, holders of the notes would cease to have any direct claim against the guarantor that delivered that guarantee or the collateral subject to the security, as the case may be, and may not receive repayment on the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

A court of competent jurisdiction in any of the provinces of Canada (a “Canadian Court”) would give a judgment based upon a final and conclusive in personam judgment of any federal or state court located in the United States (a “U.S. Court”) for a sum certain, obtained against a Canadian guarantor with respect to a claim arising out of its guarantee of the notes under the indenture (a A 10 ----- “U.S. Judgment”), without reconsideration of the merits, if the U.S. Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the Note Guarantor, as recognized by a Canadian Court (and submission in the indenture to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of a U.S. Court will be sufficient for that purpose), provided that (i) an action to enforce the U.S. Judgment is commenced in the Canadian Court within any applicable limitation period, (ii) the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the U.S. Judgment if the U.S. Judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating to the same cause of action as the U.S. Judgment, (iii) the Canadian Court will render judgment only in Canadian dollars and (iv) an action in the Canadian Court on the U.S. Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally.

The Cayman Islands makes its own laws and has independent legal and judicial systems. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The Companies Act (As Revised) (the “Cayman Companies Act”) is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent English statutory enactments and accordingly there are significant differences between the Cayman Companies Act and the current Companies Act of England. Although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States (and the Cayman Islands are not a party to any treaties for the reciprocal enforcement or recognition of such judgments with the United States), the courts of the Cayman Islands would recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States against the Company under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) or, in certain circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief, and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (a) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment; (b) such courts did A 12 ----- not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman Islands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Under the Cayman Companies Act, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Grand Court”) may wind up a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands in certain circumstances as set out in section 92 of the Cayman Companies Act, and may accept and hear petitions for the winding up of such company from a creditor or contributory of such company in accordance with the Cayman Companies Act. Where a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands is wound up by way of voluntary liquidation commenced in the circumstances set out in section 116 of the Cayman Companies Act or is subject to a winding up order by the Grand Court, then the provisions of the Cayman Companies Act and the Cayman Islands insolvency law, including the Companies Winding up Rules (As Revised), would apply. The Cayman Companies Act contains statutory provisions which provide that a company may present a petition to the Grand Court for the appointment of a restructuring officer on the grounds that the company (a) is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 93 of the Cayman Companies Act; and (b) intends to present a compromise or arrangement to its creditors (or classes thereof) either, pursuant to the Cayman Companies Act, the law of a foreign country or by way of a consensual restructuring. The petition may be presented by a company acting by its directors, without a resolution of its members or an express power in its articles of association. On hearing such a petition, the Grand Court may, among other things, make an order appointing a restructuring officer or make any other order as the Grand Court thinks fit. Notwithstanding that a liquidator, a restructuring officer and the Grand Court would apply Cayman Islands insolvency law to a winding up or restructuring under the Cayman Companies Act, foreign laws, including foreign insolvency laws, may nevertheless be relevant in any proceedings in the Cayman Islands. For example, foreign law may be relevant in a Cayman Islands liquidation where it is the proper law of a creditor’s claim. If under foreign law the creditor’s claim has been compromised (for example, in a foreign scheme of arrangement) then the Cayman Islands liquidator is likely to be bound by that compromise. Furthermore, where a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands is also being wound up in a foreign jurisdiction, the insolvency laws of that foreign jurisdiction are likely to apply to the treatment of any of the company’s assets which are under the jurisdiction of the foreign court. The rules applicable in such a foreign (ancillary) winding up may be different to the rules applicable to the winding up in the Cayman Islands. The rights of the secured creditors to enforce their rights under the guarantees may be limited by section 86 or section 91I of the Cayman Companies Act which provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them shall be binding on all the creditors or a class of creditors, as the case may be, provided that the compromise or arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of creditors with whom the compromise or arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent seventy-five per cent in value of each such class of creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the compromise or arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court. Cayman Islands authority provides that a class is constituted by those creditors whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Pursuant to the recast Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in Annex A opened after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions) within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the EU Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings relating to such company. The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial A 13 ----- difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a presumption that in the absence of proof to the contrary a company has its “centre of main interests” in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office. However, such assumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another EU Member State within the three month period prior to the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Article 3(1) also states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests” may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings as well as to restructuring proceedings, in each case of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other EU Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3 month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings, with “establishment” being defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the petition to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. If the Issuer and the EU Guarantors do not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other EU Member State. Where main proceedings have been opened in the EU Member State in which the company has its “centre of main interests,” any proceedings opened subsequently in another EU Member State in which the company has an establishment will be secondary proceedings whose effects are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the company has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU Member State where the company has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that EU Member State’s law or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment in the other EU Member State, or (ii) a public authority of the other EU Member State has the right to request the opening of the proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings A 14 ----- will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: (i) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; (ii) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (iii) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and (iv) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other EU Member States so long as no territorial proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in an EU Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no other insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU Member State or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the company has assets. However, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the EU Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other EU Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other EU Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Furthermore, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. A 15 ----- The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In the event of insolvency of a Finnish company, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings would be governed by Finnish law. In case of insolvency proceedings connected to another EU member state within the meaning of regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Insolvency Proceedings, and provided that said regulation is applied to such EU member state, the regulation shall apply. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Finnish insolvency law. The provisions of the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki, 120/2004, as amended), the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta, 47/1993, as amended, the “Finnish",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.8,"Restructuring Act”) and the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to the Bankruptcy Estate (the “Recovery Act”) (Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesään, 758/1991, as amended) are particularly relevant to this",243.8.1,Company Restructuring,"If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that company restructuring proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than temporarily, an application for company restructuring can be submitted to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring Act. Further, the initiation of company restructuring proceedings is possible—in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation—when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company restructuring. If no statutory barriers to restructuring under the Finnish Restructuring Act are established and, consequently, the court approves the application and opens restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint a restructuring administrator (selvittäjä). The purpose of a company restructuring is to investigate whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its continued viability and make debt arrangements with creditors and execute other measures. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director continue to act on behalf of the company during the restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator is entitled to review the company’s books and business documents and obtain any information on the company’s business activities, as well as to participate in meetings of the debtor’s corporate bodies. The restructuring administrator’s consent is required to certain legal acts of a significant nature of the debtor company specified in the Restructuring Act. A 16 ----- The commencement of restructuring proceedings, as a general rule, has no effect on the debtor’s existing contracts (though reorganizing debts deriving from such contracts may obviously be reorganized). However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act regarding premature termination of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the debtor, long-term contracts whereunder the debtor has committed to regularly perform certain obligations (other than the payment of cash) and employment relationships. _Moratorium_ Subject to certain exceptions, all existing claims against the company that have arisen before the filing of the restructuring application are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising after the filing of the restructuring application must be repaid and can be enforced), and the seizure of assets. The court may order, on the request of the applicant or the debtor, that such prohibitions are in effect on an interim basis as of a date even prior to the commencement of restructuring proceedings (i.e., shortly after the filing of the application for the restructuring proceedings). The suspensions are in force until the restructuring program has been verified by the district court or the proceedings have been, for reasons specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act, dismissed or interrupted. Debts arising after the filing of the application must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to fees, charges and other running expenses (e.g., lease payments) based on a continuous contractual relationship or on a continuous contract on use or possession, to the extent as these relate to the period subsequent to the filing of the application. _Debt Arrangements_ Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring debts (i.e., debts that have arisen before the filing of the application) within the restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring Act, the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt, either as a lump sum funded by the issuance of new debt or with payments in lieu of performance that are considered reasonable having regard to the creditor’s position and field of business. Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, in so far as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. The part of the claim that is not covered by the value of the security is regarded as unsecured debt for the purposes of the restructuring proceedings. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value of the property will be determined by the restructuring program. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of secured debt as a lump sum payment funded by the issuance of new debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security right, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be set so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, the length of the remaining credit period should be taken into consideration A 17 ----- in the restructuring program, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs. _Approval of the Restructuring Program_ The draft of the restructuring program will be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court will ratify it subject to the approval of all the creditors or with the acceptance of the majority in the groups of creditors. However, there are some specific limitations under the Finnish Restructuring Act which apply even if the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or the majority in all groups of creditors. Furthermore, even if the majority does not exist in one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program may nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the draft, the administrator or the debtor, subject to the terms specified in the Finnish Restructuring Act. In such a case the restructuring claims of the creditors in favor of the program must represent at minimum one-fifth of all restructuring claims of the debtor company taken into consideration in the voting procedure in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring Act and at least one group of creditors must have voted for approval of the program by majority. The debtor may also submit a proposal to the court with respect to the restructuring program, which the court may consider in its discretion. _Early Restructuring Proceeding_ In addition to what has been described above in respect of standard restructuring proceedings, debtors facing impending insolvency also have an option under the Finnish Restructuring Act to apply for the commencement of early restructuring proceedings. Early restructuring proceedings are more easily accessible to debtors, as the commencement of such proceedings does not require that the relevant debtor would already be insolvent, and creditors have more restricted rights to object to the commencement of such proceedings. The initiation of early insolvency proceedings by the creditors is not possible. The court deciding on the commencement of early insolvency proceedings may prohibit the placing of any security and payment of any existing debt as described under “Moratorium” above. However, in early restructuring proceedings, such restrictions have to be ordered by the court deciding on the restructuring application and such moratorium may remain in force for up three months which period may be extended by the court to up to 12 months based on an application from either the debtor, the administrator or a creditor. In case the debtor is later found insolvent, the administrator (if appointed) may with the consensus of the debtor and creditors representing 20% of restructuring debt apply for a transfer to standard restructuring proceedings. In general, the content and process of the early restructuring proceedings is by large similar to standard restructuring proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) (pesänhoitaja) will be appointed by the court. A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received in payment of the creditors’ claims. The bankruptcy estate may (in exceptional situations) continue the company’s business operations and the disposal of property should be realized as soon as it is reasonably possible. The debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors. _Notices to the Bankruptcy Estate with regard to Claims_ As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a “lodgment of claim”) with the estate administrator, by a deadline set by the estate administrator. Information concerning the deadline is sent to all known creditors and published in local newspaper as well as in the official gazette of Finland (Virallinen lehti). The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding even on a creditor with a secured claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third A 18 ----- party must, at the request of, and within a time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information on the receivables and collateral as should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor, as referred to in the Finnish Business Mortgages Act (Yrityskiinnityslaki 634/1984, as amended), as security for a claim shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim letter. _Disbursements_ The estate administrator draws up a list of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors (“draft disbursement list”). The court verifies that the estate administrator’s disbursement list meets the statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions relating to the draft disbursement list have been observed. The entitlement of creditors to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate is proportionate to the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to the Finnish Act on Order of Payment of the Creditors (Laki velkojien maksusaantijärjestyksestä, 1578/1992, as amended), the following creditors have priority over unsecured creditors in the following order: (i) creditors of secured claims (excluding claims secured by business mortgage) and holders of retention rights, with priority over the proceeds from the respective security asset; (ii) the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; (iii) if the company has undergone restructuring proceedings before the bankruptcy, (A) fees and expenses of the restructuring administrator with penal interest incurred until the time of payment of the fees and expenses and after satisfaction of said payment and (B) creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings and (iv) claims that are secured by a business mortgage will receive prior to other unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets. Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant of such claims are the interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy and a loan or a bond which pursuant to its terms is subordinated to ordinary debt. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds, including by way of auctions, through advertising and direct solicitation of potential buyers. However, creditors that have an interest in collateral may exercise their right of liquidation of collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale of pledged property for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission. At the request of the bankruptcy estate, assets of the bankruptcy estate may also be sold in accordance with the provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code (the “Finnish Enforcement Code”) (Ulosottokaari, 705/2007, as amended) if the bailiff consents to the same.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

According to the Finnish Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code, the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator in the company restructuring and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this period to file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three months from the moment that A 19 ----- the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of a company restructuring program, the administrator must file an action within six months from the commencement of the restructuring proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction. Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit. When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the debtor bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the returnable property.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Pursuant to such limitation, the beneficiaries of the guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against the Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by the Finnish Guarantor. Certain significant limitations to a company’s ability to grant guarantees are included in sections 1 and 10 of chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating the unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a third-party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. While the matter A 20 ----- is not entirely clear under Finnish law, the prevailing view among Finnish scholars seems to be that the financing of an acquisition of shares in a foreign direct or indirect holding company would fall outside the scope of the before mentioned prohibition provided that such foreign parent company is not a member of a group of companies controlled by a qualifying Finnish legal entity but the prohibition of financial assistance may well apply fully to all direct and indirect parent companies of the Finnish Guarantor, including foreign companies. Further, under Finnish law if a company undertakes a transaction with or for the benefit of a direct or indirect parent company or another related party on terms that deviate to the detriment of the company from arms’ length terms, then this may be construed as unlawful profit distribution. The Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant circumstances, benefits and risks to the company (on a standalone basis, and any group benefit being taken into account only if and to the extent it directly or indirectly benefits the company itself) are to be taken into account. In the context of the guarantee, among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the group companies in connection with the issue of the notes are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the guarantee granted by the Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed. For the abovementioned reasons, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees is contractually limited so as to not be in conflict with the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Guarantees granted by the Finnish Guarantors will contain such limitation language and thus be so limited. By operation of such limitation, the beneficiaries of the guarantee agree to enforce the guarantees against the Finnish Guarantors only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by the Finnish Guarantors. The limitations referred to above also apply to security granted by the Finnish Guarantors and the scope of such security would be similarly limited.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event.

A 21 ----- The pledge of most movable assets (such as shares) may be enforced without a court judgment or the involvement of an enforcement official or, should the pledgee deem it necessary, through official enforcement. A pledge of shares is typically enforced by private sale. The enforcement of an enterprise mortgage or real estate mortgage requires an enforceable title for execution and such enforcement can be effected only in accordance with mandatory provisions of the Finnish Enforcement Code. The Finnish Commercial Code (Kauppakaari, 3/1734, as amended) stipulates a default process in respect of an enforcement of pledge of movable assets. The parties may, as a rule, contract out most parts of the default process. The parties’ discretion with regard to the enforcement methods is, however, limited (a) by the statutory invalidity of a contractual provision providing that title to the pledged asset shall, upon default, automatically transfer to the pledgee (however, the debtor and creditor may, after the pledgee has become entitled to enforce the security, effectively agree that an obligation is discharged partly or in full by the pledgee assuming ownership of the pledged asset), and (b) by the pledgee always having a duty to ascertain that the interests of the pledgor and other creditors of the pledgor are not unduly jeopardized due to the actions taken by the pledgee.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system. As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. Contractual penalties (regardless of proof of actual damage) are, however, as a general rule enforceable. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.

The overview also covers a general discussion in light of the Finnish Transfer Tax Act (29.11.1996/931, as amended, Fi: Varainsiirtoverolaki). The following does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Finnish tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Finland currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Prospective purchasers of the notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences (including tax reporting obligations) of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the notes under the tax laws of Finland and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons. _Withholding Tax_ On the basis that the Issuers are not resident in Finland for tax purposes and have no presence or permanent establishment in Finland, there is no Finnish withholding tax (Fi: Lähdevero) applicable to payments made by the Issuers in respect of the notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Finland operates a system of preliminary taxation to secure payment of taxes in certain circumstances. In the context of the notes, a preliminary tax (Fi: Ennakonpidätys) of 30 per cent will generally be deducted and withheld from all payments that are treated as interest or as compensation comparable to interest (such as secondary market compensation), if and to the extent such payments are made by a paying agent or intermediary established in Finland (as defined and within the meaning of Finnish law) to Finnish tax resident individuals. Such preliminary tax will be used for the payment of the individual’s final taxes (which means that they are credited against the individual’s final tax liability). Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to limited liability companies resident in Finland for Finnish income tax purposes may be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Finnish tax. _Taxation of Finnish Resident Limited Liability Companies_ Interest and any similar payments made to limited liability companies residing in Finland as well as any capital gain received by such companies from disposal of the notes are taxable income. Current applicable corporate income tax rate is 20%. Correspondingly, any loss resulting from the disposal or redemption of the notes is deductible from the taxable business income. _Taxation of Finnish Resident Individuals_ Interest and any similar payments (e.g., interest compensation or jälkimarkkinahyvitys and index compensation or indeksihyvitys) made to Finnish resident individuals as well as any capital gain received from disposal of the notes by Finnish resident individuals are taxable capital income of the receiver. Capital income is taxable at the rate of 30% and at the rate of 34% for the amount of capital income exceeding €30,000 in the tax year in question. Capital loss is primarily deductible from the resident individual’s capital gains and secondarily from other capital income arising in the same year and during the following five calendar years. _Transfer Taxation_ There is no Finnish transfer tax payable on the acquisition, disposal or redemption of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Indeed, if a company is incorporated as a société anonyme, when there are elements which they believe are likely to jeopardize the continuity of the company’s existence as a going concern (des faits de nature à compromettre la _continuité de l’exploitation), the statutory auditors of a company must inform the chairman of the board of directors_ (conseil d’administration) or the chairman of the management board (directoire) to provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory explanations or appropriate corrective measures within 15 calendar days, the auditors must request that a meeting of the board of directors (or a meeting of the equivalent body) be convened and may request to be heard by the President of the relevant commercial court (tribunal de commerce). The minutes of the meeting of the board of directors or of the supervisory board are sent to the President of the relevant commercial court and to the social and economic committee (comité économique et social). If despite of the auditors’ request, the meeting of the board of directors (or of the equivalent body) has not been convened, or if the auditors have not convened to such meeting, or failing satisfactory explanations or appropriate corrective measures, a shareholders’ meeting shall be convened by the management and the auditors present a special report on this occasion (which is also addressed to the social and economic committee). If management fails to act, then the statutory auditors convenes the shareholders’ meeting themselves and sets the agenda. Further to the shareholders’ meeting, if the auditors consider that the decisions taken do not enable the continuity of the company’s operations, auditors must inform the President of the relevant commercial court of the warning procedure and may request to be heard by the President of the relevant commercial court. As regards companies not incorporated as société anonyme, similar warning procedures exist even if the practical details slightly differ. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their absence, the employees’ representatives have similar rights. In addition, pursuant to article L. 611-2 of the French Commercial Code, where it results from any document or procedure that the continuity of the company’s operations is likely to be jeopardized (des faits de nature à _compromettre la continuité de l’exploitation), the management of the company may be summoned by the president_ of the relevant commercial court in order to consider the appropriate measures to improve the situation. As soon as such notice is sent, the President of the relevant commercial court may obtain from the auditors, the social and economic committee and public administrations, among others, information likely to provide an accurate update of the economic and financial situation of the company. When the annual financial statements of the company are not filed within the time limits provided by law, the president of the relevant commercial court may order the management to do so as soon as possible, subject to a fine. Pursuant to the provisions of article L. 611-2-1 of the French Commercial Code, the competent civil court (tribunal judiciaire) will also be able to exercise the emergency procedure for debtors subject to its jurisdiction. In addition, where a warning procedure is initiated in accordance with articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2, L. 251-15 and L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code, if the statutory auditors consider that the situation of the relevant company requires immediate actions, and has determined that the management is refusing to take such actions or is taking insufficient measures, the statutory auditors may inform the President of the relevant commercial court concurrently with his or her initial report made to the management, to the chairman of the board of directors (conseil _d’administration) or to the chairman of the supervisory board (conseil de surveillance), as the case may be.

The judge will take his or her decision after having heard the conciliateur and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. The conciliation agreement reached between the debtor and its creditors and/or trade partners and/or other stakeholders may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force _exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Nevertheless, the termination of the conciliation agreement does not invalidate the provisions the purpose of which is to organize the consequences arising out of the termination of the _conciliation agreement. Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a_ majority of creditors large enough to render likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings, as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad _hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, in_ particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (Prepack sale - plan de cession) which would be implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial_ reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor. As a matter of law, two types of contractual provisions are deemed null and void: (i) any provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end and (ii) any provision forcing the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than threequarters of the fees of the professional advisers whom the creditors have retained in connection with these proceedings. Where the debtor cannot manage to reach an agreement with its creditors within the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings, the proceedings will end automatically.

The mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are confidential proceedings (save for, with respect to the mandat ad hoc proceedings, the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any, and, with respect to the conciliation proceedings, the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any, and, if applicable, the homologation of the conciliation agreement). In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France, or, (ii) in cases where the EU A 23 ----- Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office is in France, it could also be subject to French courtadministered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings or accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde or sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire). Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard (which does no longer exist and was replaced by one single proceeding namely accelerated safeguard proceedings by Ordinance No. 2021-1193 dated September 15, 2021), judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any company having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation (it being specified that in this case, the effects of those proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in France, Article 3, 2°). Pursuant to Article L. 721-8 of the French Commercial Code, specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (y) at least €20 million in annual net turnover and 250 employees or (z) at least €40 million in annual net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above, and to specific control thresholds), accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of a group._ The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU **Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019. The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect A 24 ----- new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of a restructuring. In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government issued: (i) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from October 1[st], 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and (ii) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and corresponding security interests in the Collateral.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties affectées), as defined below. Are considered as “affected parties” (i) any creditors whose rights are directly affected by the restructuring plan, or (ii) any stakeholders which hold an instrument giving access either immediately or on a deferred basis to the debtor’s share capital (the “Equity Holders”) in the event of their stake in the debtor’s capital, the debtor’s articles of association, or such stakeholder’s rights are modified by the draft plan. Only the affected parties can vote on the draft plan. The affected parties shall inform the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire), within 10 days from receipt of the notice sent by the court-appointed administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to notify the existence, of any intercreditor or subordination agreements entered into before the commencement of the proceedings, of any such intercreditor or subordination. Failing this, these agreements are unenforceable towards the proceedings. The composition of the classes of affected parties are determined in light of the claims and rights arising prior to the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings. The court-appointed administrator divides the affected parties into classes, which reflect sufficient commonality of economic interest, based on objective and verifiable criteria, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: - creditors holding security interests over the debtor’s assets, for their secured claims, and unsecured creditors are members of separate classes; - composition of classes respects intercreditor agreements concluded before the commencement of the proceedings; - Equity Holders and creditors are treated as separate classes A 33 ----- - Creditors that share sufficient commonalty of economic interest will be in the same class and shall benefit from equal treatment under the plan. Claims arising under employment contracts, pension rights acquired under a professional retirement scheme and essential needs claims (créances alimentaires) are excluded from the class-based consultation and therefore are not affected by the plan. At least 21 days before the date of the vote on the draft plan, the court-appointed administrator must submit to each affected party the rules governing the class formation criteria and the voting rights with respect to the class or classes to which affected parties belong and the claims or rights that enable them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into account shall be the amount indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor or, where no statutory auditor has been appointed, established by its chartered accountant. In the case of affected parties which are beneficiaries of a trust (fiducie) set up as a guarantee by the debtor, only the amounts of their claims not guaranteed by such a security shall be taken into account. Where there is an indexation clause, the amount of interest remaining due on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings is calculated at the rate applicable on the date of that judgment. Foreign currency receivables are converted into euros at the exchange rate on the date of the judgment. In the event of disagreement, each affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed administrator can challenge the rules governing the class formation criteria or the voting rights before the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire), within 10 days from the notification or publication of such rules. The supervisory judge must rule on such challenge within 10 days. In the absence of a decision by the supervisory judge in the 10 days period, the matter may be referred to the court. Appeal against the supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision as the case may be) has to be filed within 5 days of its notification to the parties. The court of appeal then has 15 days to rule. There is no possibility to submit a challenge before the French Supreme Court. The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. The debtor, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of preparing the draft plan. The draft plan shall be sent to the classes for a vote of affected parties for a vote. Affected parties may not submit alternative draft plans. The draft plan may, in particular, provide for rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps. Where the thresholds applicable to specialized commercial courts are not met, the debtor’s Equity Holders which are affected by the draft plan can make a non-monetary contribution to the restructuring (e.g. by providing their experience, reputation or professional contacts). The classes of affected parties must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge upon request from the debtor or the court-appointed administrator but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each class of affected parties (two-thirds of the votes held by the members casting a vote). The class or classes of Equity Holders vote in accordance with the provisions applicable to either extraordinary general meetings, shareholders’ meetings and special meetings or bondholders’ general meetings, as the case may be, except that the decision is taken at the same two-third majority. Within a class, the vote on the adoption of the plan may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation with its members, has received the approval of twothirds of the voting rights. There are no quorum requirements, including for classes of Equity Holders. When the classes have adopted the draft plan, the court rules upon it and verifies that the following conditions are met: - the plan has been adopted in accordance with the rules regarding the affected parties and their classification into classes; - the affected parties sharing a sufficient community of interest within the same class benefit from equal treatment and are treated in proportion to their claim or right; - all affected parties have been duly notified of the plan; A 34 ----- - if some affected parties have voted against the draft plan, none of these affected parties is worse off under the restructuring plan than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied, either in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not confirmed (the “Best Interest of",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.10,Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde),243.10.2,,"A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent, — see “Insolvency test.” In particular, as established by case law, to be granted the benefit of safeguard proceedings, the debtor cannot be requested to characterize the difficulties as affecting its business activities. Where it is not demonstrated that the debtor is experiencing difficulties that it is not able to overcome, the court may invite the debtor to request the opening of conciliation proceedings. Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings through a third-party appeal. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not_ necessary) within the list of judicial administrators (whose name can be proposed by the debtor or the public prosecutor). At the request of the debtor or the public prosecutor, or by the court on its own, two or more administrators can be appointed. The appointment of several administrators becomes mandatory when the debtor (i) owns at least three establishments outside the jurisdiction of the court where it is registered, or (ii) holds or controls (as provided by Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) at least two companies subject to court-administered proceedings, or (iii) is held or controlled (as provided by the same articles) by a company subject to court-administered proceedings, such company itself holding or controlling another company subject to such proceedings, and (iv) generates at least €20 million of annual net turnover (for (ii) and (iii)). In case mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings were commenced in the eighteen months preceding the commencement of courtadministered proceedings, the public prosecutor can object to the appointment of the mandataire ad hoc or _conciliateur as administrator. The administrator is appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an_ “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to twelve months (a first six months period which can be renewed once at the request of either the debtor, the courtappointed administrator or the public prosecutor). The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or Equity Holders (as defined below) do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will either, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex-post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor with making some or all of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Disposal decisions that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). The supervisory judge can appoint one to five controllers (contrôleurs) among the creditors who have filed a request, provided they meet certain conditions (in particular no affiliation to the debtor). Controllers (contrôleurs) assist the creditors’ representative in his functions and the supervisory judge in his duty of supervising the progress of the insolvency proceedings. In order to protect creditors’ interests and under certain conditions, the controllers may act in the interests of the creditors when the creditors’ representative fails to take sufficient action. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent, see “—Insolvency test,” before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, at any time during the observation period, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if no plan has been adopted, the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end, or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. The court may decide on the conversion upon its own initiative or at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors' representative or the public prosecutor, save in the case of (i) (b) above. In case of (i) (b) above, the A 30 ----- court may decide the conversion (i) at the request of the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was approved by the relevant classes of affected parties or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances. In these two conversion cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the supervisory judge as controllers (contrôleurs) (if any), the public prosecutor and the social and economic committee (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Ordinance No. 2021-1193, dated September 15, 2021, created a new post money privilege as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings (the “Post Money Lien”). The Post Money Lien applies exclusively to proceedings commenced from October 1, 2021. The Post Money Lien also applies in the event of an amendment to the safeguard plan or reorganization plan adopted in proceedings commenced before May 22, 2020. The Post Money Lien is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire), after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period: - The Post Money Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: - in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability during the observation period, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are published, or - for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or amended by the court, and for the purposes of its performance, it being specified that both the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote and the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the Post Money Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims, procedural costs, claims benefiting of the New Money Lien as defined above and pre-petition claims secured by a real estate security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings only)) in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - The Post Money Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. - Such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings. Once safeguard proceedings have been commenced, there will be an automatic stay on certain claims. Payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and if they do not relate to expenses necessary for the debtor’s business activities during the observation period, are not for the requirements of the proceedings, or not in consideration for services rendered or goods delivered to the debtor during this period is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the supervisory judge can authorize payments for pre-commencement debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed to continue the debtor’s operation or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire), see “—Status of Creditors.” This automatic stay does not apply to claims A 31 ----- secured by a security interest conferring a retention right, claims assigned by way of Dailly assignment of receivables and claims secured by a trust (fiducie). During the safeguard proceedings, any increase in the perimeter of a contractual security interest or a contractual right of retention, regardless of the method used, is prohibited. Consequently, margin call provisions are neutralized. This prohibition does not apply to any assignment of receivables as set forth in Articles 313-23 et. seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code if the framework master agreement was entered into before the commencement of the proceedings. Creditors (and, if applicable, Equity Holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business. Liabilities to be taken into account in the draft plan shall include, provided that they are established on the basis of a certificate prepared by a chartered accountant or the statutory auditor, those claims admitted and not challenged as well as those “identifiable”. _Standard consultation: for debtors which have, on the date of the petition for the commencement of the_ proceedings, (i) less than 250 employees and less than an annual net turnover of at least €20 million or (ii) less than an annual net turnover of at least €40 million. This also applies in respect of debtors which own or control other entities within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, who fall below these thresholds. If so requested by the debtor and with the consent of the supervisory judge, creditors may also be subject to the class-based consultation. In the framework of a standard consultation, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claim over the length of the plan (ten year maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum if fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved do not need to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-forequity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the Post Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be at least 5% of the amount of each claim and from the sixth year onwards, at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. A 32 ----- If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual applicable legal provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period (which cannot exceed the duration of the plan) during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best,243.11.1,,"Interest of Creditors Test, the court will determine the value of the company on a going concern basis; - where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties. The court may refuse to approve the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The court must check that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected”. The judgement adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the plan is not approved by the required majority of each class of affected parties, it may be approved (arrêté) by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor and be imposed on the parties that voted against the draft plan (“Cross-Class Cram-Down”), where the plan meets the following conditions: - the plan complies with the conditions for the adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; - the plan has been approved by: - a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, including at least one class of secured creditors or a class ranking higher than the class of unsecured creditors; or, if such condition is not met, - by at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than a class of Equity Holders or any other class which, after determination of the value of the debtor as a going concern, it may reasonably be assumed it would not be entitled to any payment, if the order of priority payments in judicial liquidation proceedings were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a courtordered sale plan (plan de cession)); - the claims of a dissenting class of affected creditors shall be paid in full (by identical or equivalent means) if a more junior class receives any distribution or keeps any interest under the restructuring plan (the “absolute priority rule”). However, at the request of (i) the debtor or (ii) the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor, the court may decide to deviate from the application of the absolute priority rule where such deviations are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan and where such restructuring plan does not excessively prejudice the rights or interest of any affected party. In particular, claims of the debtor’s suppliers of goods or services, the Equity Holders and claims arising from the debtors’ tort liability may receive special treatment; - under the safeguard plan, no class of affected parties may receive or retain more than the total amount of its claims or interests; - in the case of one or more dissenting classes of Equity Holders: - the formation of classes of affected parties was compulsory regarding the thresholds met by the debtor (i.e., 250 employees and an annual net turnover of at least €20 million or with an annual net turnover of at least €40 million at the group level); - it may reasonably be assumed, after determination of the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the dissenting classes of Equity Holders would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if A 35 ----- the order of priority of payments in judicial liquidation proceedings were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); - if the draft plan provides for a share capital increase subscribed in cash (including by way of set off with payable claims), the shares to be issued are offered in preference to the existing shareholders, in proportion to the part of the share capital represented by their shares; - the plan does not provide for the sale of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of Equity Holders (only forced dilution is possible). The decision of the court shall constitute approval of the changes to the shareholding structure or to the rights of the Equity Holders or to the articles of association provided for in the plan. The court may appoint judicial representative to carry out the acts necessary for the implementation of these amendments. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set up a timeperiod (which cannot exceed the duration of the plan) during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. At the latest within 10 days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that: - the Best Interest of Creditors Test criterion has not been met; or - the condition relating to the adoption of the draft plan by at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote (other than a class of Equity Holders or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, it is reasonable to assume would not be entitled to any payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation was applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a courtordered sale plan)) has not been met; or - in the event of a cross class-cram-down on Equity Holders, the condition relating to the debtor’s value criterion has not been met (i.e., it is reasonable to assume, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the Equity Holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation was applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, of a court-ordered sale plan)), may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may be appealed under the ordinary procedure by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor, within 10 days from its notification (or of its communication if the appeal was lodged by the public prosecutor). The decision of the court of appeal may be challenged before the French Supreme Court. In case of failure to adopt the plan in safeguard proceedings, the alternatives are either the termination of these proceedings or the conversion into judicial reorganization proceedings. The imposition of an alternative plan and payment terms is not possible. Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

The accelerated safeguard proceedings are designed to “fasttrack” difficulties faced by any debtor under Ordinance No. 2021-1193 dated September 15, 2021. If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require the classes of affected parties to be constituted, the court opening accelerated safeguard proceedings must order such formation. In that regard, the court shall authorize such constitution for the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings. To be eligible for accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable); - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough affected parties involved in the proceedings to render its adoption by the relevant classes of affected parties likely within a maximum of two months, extendable for two months, following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings; - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings; and - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome. The opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings only has effects with regards to the affected parties, i.e. those parties directly affected by the draft safeguard plan prepared by the debtor in the context of its conciliation proceedings. When the debtor’s accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan will be adopted only by creditors having the status of finance companies, credit institutions and equivalent (i.e. those institutions (i) referred to in Articles L. 511-1 and L. 518-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et _financier), (ii) operating under the freedom establishment or the freedom to provide services in the territory of the_ States parties to the agreement on the European Economic Area mentioned in Book V of the French Monetary and Financial Code and (iii) any other entity with which the debtor has entered into a credit transaction, the “Financial Institution”), as well as by all holders of a claim acquired from them or from a supplier of goods or services and, where applicable, bondholders, the debtor may request the commencement of safeguard proceedings, the effects of which are limited to these creditors. In such case, creditors that are not concerned by the procedure are therefore not affected by the plan. Such creditors will neither be subject to majority rules, nor to the rescheduling or cancellation of their debts. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard proceedings apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. The other creditors’ debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings in relation to the constitution of classes of affected parties is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (for example, affected parties will be consulted by A 37 ----- way of a class-based consultation on a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée)) and affected parties may not prepare alternative draft plans as described above, see “—Class-based consultation,” to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is four months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial two-month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings when classes of affected parties are set up and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). If a plan is not adopted by the affected parties and approved by the court within the applicable deadlines, the court shall terminate the proceedings. If the debtor then becomes insolvent, it must file for judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire). The list of claims (which shall also mention the subordination agreements communicated to the debtor by the creditors prior to the opening of the insolvency proceeding) of affected parties to the conciliation proceedings established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings, unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing, see “— Status of Creditors” below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings. If it does not, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert reorganization proceedings into liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the social and economic committee (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan) or, unlike safeguard proceedings, if it appears that a reorganization plan is not possible, the sale of the business (which will occur through an open bid process organized by the administrator) or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission _d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission_ A 38 ----- _d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard_ proceedings, subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are similar, subject to certain exceptions including: - if the debtor does not meet the required thresholds, the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); - any affected party may also prepare a reorganization draft plan which shall be submitted, together with the plan drafted by the debtor, to a vote of the classes of affected parties at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; - if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void; - if the classes of affected parties do not approve the reorganization plan, it may be approved (arrêté) by the court at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator (with the debtor’s consent), or the court-appointed administrator with the approval of one affected party and be imposed on the classes that voted against the draft plan (the “Cross-Class Cram-Down”), where the plan meets the conditions of the Cross-Class Cram-Down mechanism; - if the reorganization plan is not adopted by the classes of affected parties or according to the Cross-Class Cram-Down mechanism, the ability to impose an alternative plan according to the classic individual consultation and impose payment terms by the court is possible (following individual consultation, the court can impose a term-out plan on dissenting creditors for up to ten years). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor, or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, Ordinance No. 2021-1193, dated September 15, 2021 modified, the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new Post Money Lien (as defined and detailed above, see “—Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde”)). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in the framework of individual standard consultation, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and allows the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision A 39 ----- commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be simultaneously purchased by the transferees. Any consent clause (clause d'agrément) is deemed unwritten. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings, nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). Managers are no longer in possession. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the_ business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, known as a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; - as part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets, jobs, and contracts) without the liabilities pertaining to them (with exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the business as a going concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. - subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan, provided that such creditors have filed their claims. In this case, the debtor is released from the payment of these remaining installments; A 40 ----- - the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets for example) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless reaching an agreement with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in _bonis market value;_ - separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the insolvency judge (liquidateur) may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when (a) there are no remaining due liabilities and the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or (b) the continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets or in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. Law n°2021-689 May 31, 2021 has introduced a new insolvent procedure available until June 2, 2023, which is called “procédure de traitement de sortie de crise” and can be summarized as an accelerated and simplified judicial reorganization proceedings for small undertaking, i.e. undertakings that have less than 20 employees and whose reported liability amount excluding equity is lower than 3 million euros. As a result, its regime will not be discussed further herein.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the date of insolvency of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. A 41 ----- Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void by the court (the court must declare these transactions void on petition by the administrator, the insolvency judge, the public prosecutor, or the plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) or voidable by the court (subject to the court’s discretionary decision on petition by the administrator, the insolvency judge, the public prosecutor, or the plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)). - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors.

Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.” In addition, pursuant Article L. 632-1 of the French Commercial Code, the court may declare null and void any acts transferring the ownership of asset without any consideration and any notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration _d’insaisissabilité) entered into within six months prior to the date of insolvency (date de cessation des paiements)._ Third party rights, including bona fide third parties, can be affected by those voidance provisions.

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) dated January 14, 2014, No. 12-22.909 regarding a judicial reorganization proceedings and in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court A 42 ----- dated February 22, 2017, No 15-15.942 regarding a safeguard proceedings, which case law may be extended to accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, except in accelerated safeguard proceedings and judicial liquidation proceedings where the continued operation of the business has not been ordered by the court, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. The court-appointed administrator can, conversely, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of reorganization or liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire)) required by the continued operation of the business or to pay a carrier requesting payment directly from the debtor); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor, security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien or a Post Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors (or beneficiaries of a security interest over tangible asset granted by a third-party to secure the debt of the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings in the framework of a safeguard, an accelerated safeguard or a reorganization proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of pre-opening amounts owed to the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset - whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable - is located in another EU Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the A 43 ----- insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are commenced in such EU Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party). - any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) or the French Insurance Code (Code des assurances); and - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (plan _de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) adopted by the court._ In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings. Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims and securities arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin officiel des annonces civiles et _commerciales) (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose_ claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims or securities have not been submitted during the relevant period, or claims that are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative, are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, however the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its chartered certified accountant). Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the A 44 ----- list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the _conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines._ If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor whether partial (within the frame of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings) or total (within the frame of reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling its debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency legislation assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court official fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a Post Money Lien, post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company. In such case, Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings have been commenced against the debtor, such creditor being deemed de facto manager may be liable bearing the excess of liabilities over the company's assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de _facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of_ assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.

This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business. Where any of the sectors specified by law or regulations are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure: - a transaction as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business (branche d’activité) or (iii) crosses the threshold of 33.33 percent of the share capital or voting rights, in each case of a company whose registered office is located in France; - a transaction as a result of which an EU/EEA investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business, in either case of a company whose registered office is located in France; and - a transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control acquires all or part of a business of a company whose registered office is located in France.

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the principal obligations. Any payment in respect of the principal obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the applicable Notes Collateral Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the notes. The pledges governed by French law will be granted in favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the secured creditors and will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Trustee under the applicable Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the indenture) provide instruction to the applicable Notes Collateral Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a collateral agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the notes or security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the applicable Notes Collateral Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the applicable Notes Collateral Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code by Article 792-0 bis of the French Code _général des impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published_ decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. Under French financial assistance rules, a company incorporated as a société anonyme or a société par actions _simplifiée is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for_ the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that these criteria were not fulfilled. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. French law has recognized that certain inter-group transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the guarantor, in particular, where the following four criteria are fulfilled: - the existence of a genuine group of companies under a common strategy working towards a common objective and the guarantee and the transaction to which it relates, must be entered into in the common economic intent of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate of such group benefit; - the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit; - the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is commensurate to such group benefit; and - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial capability. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Note Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes guarantees.

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by, as the case may be, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the restructuring plan (commissaire à l’exécution du _plan) of the relevant debtor, or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act_ in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all creditors of the relevant debtor (if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the courtappointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à _l’exécution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the claim was lodged by such creditor) if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, (in the case of a claim lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

The directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals. The U.S. and France currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitral awards rendered in commercial matters and, with respect to France, awards rendered in the United States civil matters). Consequently, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (tribunal _judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte)_ A 50 ----- proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having “indirect” jurisdiction over the matter as this concept is defined by French courts in the context of enforcement of foreign judgments, meaning that the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such courts, the choice of the U.S. courts is not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdictions over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules (“ordre public _international”), both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case including fundamental_ procedural rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by, among others, (i) French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial, or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons, the communication of which could harm the sovereignty, security or essential economic interests of France or contravening public policy) completed by Decree N 2022-207 of February 18, 2022, and (ii) by French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 and Decree No. 2018-1126 relating to the protection of trade secrets, as amended from time to time, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as mainly modified by French laws No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018, No. 2021-998 of July 30, 2021 and No. 2021-1017 of August 2, 2021, Decrees No. 2018-687 of August 3, 2018 and No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, as well as French Ordinances No. 2018-1125 of December 12, 2018 and No. 2019-964 of September 18, 2019) could limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France and from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes French international public policy. Further, in case of an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (Article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, since a 2006 decision, the French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, the French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the A 51 ----- privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. Also, in 2012, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Although this solution has since been tempered by subsequent French case law, any provisions to the same or similar effect in any relevant documents might not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court-appointed expert in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or judicially-appointed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Under Hong Kong law, a company incorporated in Hong Kong (the “Hong Kong Company”) or any of its subsidiaries is prohibited from providing “financial assistance” (as defined in section 274 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622 of the laws of Hong Kong) (the “Companies Ordinance”)) for the acquisition of shares in the Hong Kong Company or for the purpose of reducing or discharging a liability incurred for the purpose of such acquisition, unless the transaction falls within the permitted exceptions under the Companies Ordinance or the giving of the financial assistance is authorized by one of the relevant procedures provided under the Companies Ordinance. If the Hong Kong Guarantor’s profits available for distribution are less than the value of the notes, the guarantee provided by the Hong Kong Guarantor may be challenged as an unauthorized distribution to its shareholder. Under applicable Hong Kong law relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, such as those relating to preferences, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or insolvency affecting a Hong Kong company or its assets, a guarantee or collateral granted by a Hong Kong company may be voided. For example, without limitation: - a guarantee or collateral granted by a Hong Kong company may constitute an unfair preference if it is influenced by a desire to prefer the beneficiary, and it puts the beneficiary in a better position in the event of insolvency of the Hong Kong company than it would otherwise have been in. A guarantee or collateral may be an unfair preference if it is granted during the six month period before the winding up is commenced, but this can be extended to a two year period if the beneficiary of the guarantee or collateral is an associate (as defined under applicable Hong Kong law) of the relevant Hong Kong company; - if a Hong Kong company enters into a transaction with a person at an undervalue (and receives no consideration or consideration which is significantly less than the consideration provided by the Hong Kong company), then the transaction may be set aside. For the transaction to be set aside, it must have been entered into in the five-year period before the Hong Kong company’s winding up is commenced; A 52 ----- - transactions made with the intention to defraud creditors or for a fraudulent purpose may be set aside. A liquidator, creditor or other person thereby prejudiced may apply to the court for relief. For example, a transaction can be set aside if the liquidator establishes that it took place with the aim of placing assets beyond the reach of creditors; and - a floating charge granted by a Hong Kong company shall be invalid if the relevant charge was created in a twelve-month period (or two year period, if the charge was granted in favor of a person connected (as determined in accordance with applicable Hong Kong laws) with the Hong Kong company) ending on the date of commencement of the liquidation of the Hong Kong company and such company was already insolvent at the time of creating the floating charge (or as a result of having created the floating charge).",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

However, according to the Swedish Rights of Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslagen (1970:979)) some preferential and secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights (Sw. särskild och _allmän förmånsrätt). Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to_ payment from such property. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Claims that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other. However, a claim can also be subordinated, for example, if the creditor has entered into an agreement stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of bankruptcy, claims in relation to the bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the debtor) due to costs relating to the bankruptcy (including fees payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), may have priority over claims in relation to the debtor. In general, proceeds are distributed in the following order: (i) fees to the receiver in bankruptcy; (ii) debts of the estate (Sw. massaskuld); (iii) specific preferential rights; (iv) general preferential rights; (v) non-prioritized debts; and (vi) subordinated debts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

According to the Swedish Companies Act, a value transfer from a Swedish limited liability company (a “Swedish Company”) would be unlawful to the extent (i) the Swedish Company after such transfer would not have sufficient funds to cover its debts and its restricted equity or (ii) to the extent it would not be considered prudent by the Swedish Company to undertake the value transfer after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish Company’s business or the Swedish Company’s need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position. Should the Swedish Company be a parent company, the latter assessment should be made also on group level. The provision of a guarantee or security interest by a Swedish company for a third party’s obligation would typically be deemed to constitute a value transfer to the extent the guarantee or security interest is deemed to be made for an obligation, if the obligor in relation to such obligation would be deemed not able to fulfil its obligation to repay the Swedish Company at the time the guarantee or security interest is provided by the Swedish Company, and when determining the repayment capacity, the value of the shares in the Swedish Company may not be included. Furthermore, according to the Swedish Companies Act, a Swedish Company may not, subject to certain exceptions, provide a guarantee or security interest for an obligation of, among other things, its shareholder or a shareholder of another company within the same group of companies. The most important exception in this case would be that the prohibition does not apply to any guarantee or security interest provided for an obligation of another company within the same group (Sw. koncern) of companies where the parent company of the group is domiciled within the EEA. Finally, the Swedish Companies Act prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a guarantee or security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company or any of its parent or fellow subsidiary companies.

A company reorganization may be granted by the court if it can be presumed that the company cannot pay its due and payable debts or that such inability will exist shortly or that the debtor, in some other respect, is having financial difficulties which entail a risk of insolvency and there are clear grounds to assume that the viability of the company’s business can be secured through the company reorganization. Company reorganization proceedings continue for an initial period of three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended with three-month periods at a time. A company reorganization may not last longer than a total of fifteen months although certain key provisions for the benefit of the debtor, e.g., the moratorium on execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security and the termination of contracts entered into by the debtor, can only be extended to have effect for a total of twelve months (as described further below). An administrator (Sw. rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. If the debtor undertakes any of the mentioned legal acts, the legal act shall be rescinded where the administrator, within a reasonable time after they learned or should have learned about the legal act, so requests. However, a legal act between the debtor and a third person which is undertaken on or before the date on which the restructuring was registered in the insolvency register shall be valid notwithstanding that it was performed without the administrator’s consent, unless it is shown that the other party knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that company restructuring had been ordered for the debtor. All parties with a claim or right affected by the reorganization are included in a company reorganization and divided into one or more classes based on similarity in ranking and other interests. The company reorganization can include anything the parties may voluntarily agree on, including e.g. debt restructuring, change of terms, issue of shares, change in management, debt-to-equity swaps. Limitations exist e.g. by principles of equal treatment of creditors in the same class, meaning that it is not possible to favor a specific contract or creditor. Furthermore, the A 55 ----- outcome for a creditor in the company reorganization may not be worse than it would have been in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy. A company reorganization procedure entails a stay of enforcement measures and bankruptcy during the procedure (subject to certain exceptions, including enforcement of certain types of security). The stay of enforcement will last for a maximum period of twelve months, even if the company reorganization procedure continues beyond that point. Existing security does not expire, but cannot be enforced during the period of the company reorganization procedure (security in the possession of a creditor may be enforced, unless it is likely that this would jeopardise the reorganization or the stay would unfairly prejudice the creditors of those claims and subject to the approval of the administrator). A debtor subject to a company reorganization may elect which contracts to fulfil during the company reorganization procedure. The debtor will require the administrator’s approval to perform a contract entered into prior to the reorganization (in part or in full), unless the contract is in the course of day-to-day management of the business. The debtor may, with the consent of the administrator, terminate long-term contracts with three-month notice period. Counterparties are generally prohibited from terminating contracts, including credit agreements and financing agreements. Creditors may only terminate contracts entered into prior to the reorganization if the debtor does not perform the contracts or after confirmation from the debtor (and the administrator) that the contract will not be performed. The debtor shall compensate for loss incurred by the contracting party as a consequence of the termination. The contracting party’s claim for damages shall be deemed to have arisen prior to the order regarding company restructuring and may therefore be subject to write-off. Following a decision to initiate a company reorganization, the debtor may request that the court schedule a negotiation regarding a reorganization plan (plan negotiation). In the proposed reorganization plan, the affected parties shall be divided into one or more classes based on similarity in ranking and other interests, and parties within the same class must be treated equally. The affected parties (i.e. the parties whose claims are affected by the proposed reorganization plan) shall vote to adopt the proposed reorganization plan. If the plan is adopted, the court will consider whether there are grounds to confirm it. A reorganization plan is considered adopted by the affected parties if, for each class of creditors, not less than two-thirds of the parties voting have approved the plan, and the claims or rights of such approving parties constitute not less than two-thirds of the claims or rights for which voting rights may be exercised. A reorganization plan that has not been adopted in accordance with the foregoing may upon request by the debtor or the administrator be confirmed by a court by way of cross-group cram-down subject to certain conditions, including: that the reorganization plan has been approved by more than one-half of the classes and at least one of these is comprised of creditors who have a right of priority, a security interest, or a right of setoff, or at least two of these classes are creditors who can be expected to receive payment in the debtor’s bankruptcy; and classes that voted against the reorganization plan receive at least as beneficial treatment under the reorganization plan as that of other classes which have the same priority in the event of the debtor’s bankruptcy, and receive full satisfaction for their claims if any lower priority group receive payment or retains rights under the reorganization plan. Further, no group of affected parties may keep more than the full value of their claims or rights. A reorganization plan that has been confirmed by the court is binding on the company, all affected parties and potential counterparties in agreements concerning new financing.

In the event of bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs), the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw. _konkursförvaltare) who will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtors assets and_ distribute the proceeds among the creditors. The bankruptcy estate (Sw. konkursbo) is deemed to constitute a separate legal entity. The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In A 56 ----- general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s directors or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets. When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of Priority Act, as amended, which states the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, preferential or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other creditors. A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts. A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of bankruptcy proceedings or similar is likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right to fulfil the company’s obligations according to a contract). If the bankruptcy estate steps into the contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may demand that the bankruptcy estate performs its newly assumed obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the bankruptcy estate, without unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order to protect it against loss. If the bankruptcy estate does not step into the contract within a reasonable time after the creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the creditor’s request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract. In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Sw. Kronofogdemyndigheten) or the court. Upon obtaining an enforcement order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. If agreed upon between a pledgor and a secured creditor and the secured creditor or its agent is in physical possession of the security assets, the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without the involvement of the Swedish Enforcement Authority or a court. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent but it should be noted that the secured party or its agent has, in case of such a right of enforcement, extensive obligations to observe the pledgor’s interest when enforcing the pledge, such as an obligation to account for the proceeds of the sale.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of a specific trigger event (e.g. an enforcement event) would therefore not be effective until such trigger event has occurred and the guarantor being effectively deprived of its right to deal or dispose over the relevant asset (thereby resulting in the security interests having been perfected at such time). Security interests that are subject to such delayed perfection stand the risk of being subject to a hardening period and clawback claims whereby the security interest might be held invalid and unenforceable. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security. A 57 ----- In the case of a pledge over shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the share certificates to the possession of the pledgee. In addition, if the share certificates are situated outside Sweden, perfection of the pledge may require that all necessary perfection requirements under the applicable laws in such jurisdictions are also complied with. The right to future shares and dividends can be pledged. As set out above, any security purported to be created over, inter alia, (i) future shares before such shares are issued and/or (ii) dividends after a certain triggering event, will not be perfected from the outset and may as such be vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The United States and Sweden do not currently have a convention or treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States in civil and commercial matters, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden. In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated de novo by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by a federal or state court in the U.S. may be regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of the relevant foreign law, but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2012 Brussels Regulation, a final and conclusive judgment rendered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all EU Member States) and which is enforceable in such a Member State, will be recognized and enforceable in proceedings taken in Sweden upon the satisfaction of the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels Regulation. It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden. With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a final and conclusive judgment rendered against a company in the courts of a Contracting Party (as defined in therein, i.e., all EU Member States and member states of the EFTA other than Liechtenstein (namely Iceland, Switzerland and Norway)) and which is enforceable in such Contracting Party, will be recognized and enforceable in proceedings taken in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under the Lugano Convention. With regard to the provisions of the Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the “Hague Convention”), a final and conclusive judgment rendered against a company in the courts of a Contracting State (as defined therein) and which is enforceable in such Contracting State, will be recognized and enforceable in proceedings taken in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under the Hague Convention. A 58 ----- Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a member state under any applicable convention or treaty (such as the terms of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or a contracting state under the terms of the Lugano Convention), including without limitation judgments made in the United States of America and non-EU/EFTA countries, would generally not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law, and would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden without a retrial on the merits. Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability the translation into Swedish of any relevant document, and assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations. It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency issued by a Swedish party can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish party giving such powers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over assets located in Switzerland. The enforcement of claims and questions relating to insolvency and bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs vom 11. April 1889, the “DEBA”), as amended from time to time. The rules under the DEBA may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under these rules claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of bankruptcy proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets and liabilities of the Swiss debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge (including mortgages) must follow a special enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed on a private liquidation. However, if bankruptcy is declared while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer permitted. The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force. As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt enforcement procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons by local debt enforcement authorities (Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior proceedings if the following requirements are met: (1) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors or the A 60 ----- auditors of the company (in case of failure of the board of directors) declare that the debtor is over-indebted (überschuldet) within the meaning of article 725b para. 3 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or if it declares to be insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), or (2) at the request of a creditor, if the debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of its creditors or ceases to make payments (Zahlungseinstellung) or if certain events happen during composition proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung). All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently form the bankrupt estate, which after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, are used to satisfy the creditors. Assets of the bankrupt estate over which a pledge (or mortgage) was created in favor of a creditor before the declaration of bankruptcy are included in the bankrupt estate. The pledgee or any security agent, as the case may be, is under an obligation to remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate. The assets are liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy in the same manner as the other assets of the bankrupt estate, but the creditor secured by the pledge retains its privilege to be satisfied from the proceeds of the liquidation of the assets pledged to it with priority over the unsecured creditors. Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The first and the second class, which are privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident insurance, pension plans, employee social plans and family law. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class. A secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral. Also, it should be noted that a contractual postponement and subordination of claims against a Swiss debtor, a contractual restriction of enforcement actions against a Swiss debtor or an appointment by a Swiss debtor of a third party to act as its attorney or receiver would be valid as between the parties thereto, but may not be binding on an insolvency official after the occurrence of an insolvency event. Claims assigned for security purposes by a Swiss Guarantor that come into existence prior to the opening of bankruptcy can be enforced by the assignee outside Swiss bankruptcy proceedings. Assigned claims that come into existence after the opening of bankruptcy over a Swiss Guarantor may fall within the bankrupt estate and the assignee may not be entitled to such claim proceeds. Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors. Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a temporary moratorium (provisorische _Nachlassstundung) of a maximum duration of four months. During the moratorium, the debtor can seek to_ restructure and, if successful, ask the court to lift the moratorium without entering into a composition agreement. The moratorium can also result in a composition agreement which takes the form of (1) either an ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag) where the debtor’s business continues and the contractual terms of its payment obligations are modified (Stundungsvergleich) or creditors receive a dividend (Dividendenvergleich) or (2) a composition agreement providing for the assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit _Vermögensabtretung) where the debtor’s assets are assigned to creditors in order to sell the debtor’s assets (or part_ of it) or to liquidate such assets. The moratorium could also result in a composition agreement that may comprise the formation of a new company (Auffanggesellschaft) to receive part of the business of the debtor. During a moratorium, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. Furthermore, debt collection proceedings can in principle not be initiated and pending debt collection proceedings are stayed. Special enforcement proceedings to liquidate collateral cannot in principle be initiated or continued (although a secured creditor may have to take, during the moratorium, certain actions to safeguard its rights in connection with any special enforcement proceeding instigated before the moratorium). In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. In principle, interest ceases to accrue against the debtor for all unsecured claims. With the consent of the commissionaire, the debtor has the right to terminate long-term contracts at any time if without such termination the restructuring cannot be achieved. The moratorium does however not per se affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors: (i) The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is reversed: the beneficiary must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length. (ii) Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (x) granting of security for existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (y) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other way than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (z) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time. (iii) Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the intention to disadvantage some creditors over others or to favor some creditors over others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence, must have been known to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is reversed: the beneficiary must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable. If any guarantee or security interest is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of that guarantee or security and would have a claim solely under the notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.17,Switzerland,243.17.3,Enforcement of Judgments,"We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in Switzerland, or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. Enforcement in Switzerland of judgments rendered outside Switzerland would be subject to the limitations set forth in (1) the Lugano Convention of October 30, 2007 on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, (2) such other (multilateral or bilateral) international treaties under which Switzerland is bound, and (3) the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (Bundesgesetz über das Internationale Privatrecht (the “PILA”); namely art. 25 et seq. of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law). The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceeding set forth by the PILA and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische _Zivilprozessordnung) and/or the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the_ original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would A 62 ----- be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in Articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which include: - the Swiss court determines that the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings; - the judgment is final under U.S. federal or state law, and no ordinary legal remedy being available against such judgment; - the recognition of the foreign judgment (i.e. the enforcement of such foreign judgment) is not manifestly incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer ordre public); - the parties have been properly served with process according to the law of the state of his/her/its domicile or ordinary residence (if in Switzerland, through judicial aid granted by the Swiss authorities) or the counterparty has unconditionally joined the proceedings; - the proceedings leading to the judgment have respected the principles of a fair trial (as understood in Switzerland) and, in particular, that the counterparty has been granted the right to be heard and the possibility to properly defend his/her/its case; and - the matter (Rechtsstreit) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter (Rechtsstreit) which was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entering its proceedings, or the matter (Rechtsstreit) resulting in the judgement of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter (Rechtsstreit) previously decided by a Swiss court or by a court in another jurisdiction, provided that such non-Swiss decision is enforceable in Switzerland. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the notes may be able to enforce in Switzerland judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from New York courts. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of art. 6 (PILA). Furthermore, it is doubtful whether a Swiss court would enforce a judgment of any U.S. court predicated solely upon the federal or state securities laws of the United States. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages ordered by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery process exists. Instead, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the related burden of proof. Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad on a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s reservation to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters concluded on November 15, 1965) and service must be effective by way of judicial assistance. Enforcement claims or court judgments against a Swiss entity under Swiss debt collection or bankruptcy proceedings may be made only in Swiss francs and any foreign currency amounts must accordingly be converted into Swiss francs. With respect to enforcing creditors, any such foreign currency amounts will be converted at the exchange rate prevailing in particular on (i) the date of instituting the enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsverfahren) and (ii) upon creditor’s request, the date of the filing for the continuation of the enforcement procedure (Fortsetzungsbegehren). With respect to non-enforcing creditors, foreign currency amounts will be converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy (Konkurseröffnung).

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.17,Switzerland,243.17.4,Limitations on Enforcement of a Guarantee or a Security Interest Granted by Swiss Guarantors,"The granting of guarantees or security by the Swiss guarantor as well as any other undertaking contained in any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights or the subordination of intra-group claims, granted by the Swiss guarantor for the benefit of its direct and indirect parent and sister companies are subject to certain restrictions on the distribution of corporate assets under Swiss corporate law. Therefore, in order to enable the Swiss guarantor to grant guarantees and security interests securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such restrictions and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain socalled “limitation language” (see below) in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft). as is the Swiss guarantor, or a Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of the guarantee and security interests granted by the Swiss guarantor will be limited reflecting the requirement that payments under the guarantee or, as the case may be, the use of proceeds from the enforcement of security interests may not cause the Swiss guarantor to incur a liability which would exceed its freely distributable equity at the time of the enforcement of the guarantee or, as the case may be, any security interest. The freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount which the Swiss guarantor can distribute to its shareholders or shareholders, respectively, as a dividend payment under Swiss law at that point in time. These limitations apply in relation to guarantees or security interests securing the performance of any obligations of any (direct or indirect) shareholder and/or any sister company of the Swiss guarantor. Generally, any guarantee or security governed by Swiss law is enforced in accordance with its terms under Swiss law. Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of Article 111 of the Swiss Code of Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative. Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency, in which case the right of objection pursuant to Article 41 of the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in advance that a private sale (Freihandverkauf) will be admissible. In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In such a case, in order to determine the price for the acquisition of the pledged assets, the security agent may either sell the pledged assets or liquidate the company whose shares have been pledged and sell its assets in such a manner as it sees fit. Thereafter, the security agent will settle the acquisition of the pledged assets with the pledgor. For this purpose, the gross proceeds of any sale of the pledged assets or of the liquidation of the company whose shares have been pledged will, after payment of expenses and taxes and – in case of a liquidation – any third-party debts, be considered the price for the acquisition of the pledged assets, which is applied to the secured obligations. The security agent will credit any remaining surplus to the pledgor. In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency. After insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. The notes indenture provides for the following Swiss limitation language: If and to the extent that obligations of a Swiss Guarantor under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation, are for the benefit of its direct or indirect affiliates (other than its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) and that complying with such obligations would constitute a repayment of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such A 64 ----- Swiss Guarantor or would otherwise be restricted under Swiss corporate law then applicable (the “Restricted Obligations”), the following provisions shall apply: The aggregate liability of a Swiss Guarantor for Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation, including, without limitation, under the guarantee, shall be limited to the extent and in the maximum amount of its freely disposable equity (frei verfügbares Eigenkapital) at the point in time such Swiss Guarantor’s obligations fall due (including, without limitation, any statutory reserves which can be transferred into unrestricted, distributable reserves) (the “Available Amount”), provided that this is a requirement under applicable law and practice at that time and further provided that such limitation (as may apply from time to time or not) shall not (generally or definitively) release such Swiss Guarantor from performing Restricted Obligations hereunder in excess thereof, but merely postpone the performance date therefor until such times as performance is again permitted notwithstanding such limitation. If the enforcement of the obligations of the Swiss Guarantor under the notes indenture or an applicable guarantee would be limited due to the effects set out hereunder, the Swiss Guarantor shall further, to the extent permitted by applicable law and Swiss accounting standards and upon request by the Trustee, (i) write up or sell any of its assets that are shown in its balance sheet with a book value that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets, in case of sale, however, only if such assets are not necessary for the Swiss Guarantor’s business (nicht _betriebsnotwendig) and (ii) reduce its share capital to the minimum allowed under then applicable law, provided that_ such steps are permitted under the notes indenture. Immediately after having been requested to perform Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation, a Swiss Guarantor shall and any parent company of such Swiss Guarantor shall procure that such Swiss Guarantor will: (i) if and to the extent requested by the Trustee or required under then applicable Swiss law, provide the Trustee, within 30 business days, with (a) an interim up-to-date balance sheet audited by its statutory auditors, (b) the determination by the statutory auditors of the Available Amount based on such interim audited balance sheet and (c) a confirmation from the statutory auditors of such Swiss Guarantor that the Available Amount complies with the provisions of Swiss corporate law which are aimed at protecting the share capital and legal reserves; (ii) take such further corporate and other action which may be necessary at the time (such as board and shareholder approvals and the receipt of any confirmations from its statutory auditors) in order to allow a prompt payment under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation with a minimum of limitations; and/or (iii) immediately after confirming the Available Amount in accordance with sub-paragraph (i) above, procure that any amounts received or collected by the Trustee under and in connection with Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation in excess of the Available Amount shall be retransferred to it as soon as possible and, if not already done so, be paid up to the Available Amount (less, if required, any Swiss withholding tax) to the Trustee. Payments by Swiss Guarantors may be reduced due to the obligation to deduct the Swiss withholding tax on dividends (currently at the rate of 35% subject to applicable double taxation treaties), to the extent that the payment is regarded as a distribution of dividends to the Company or any other related party. The Swiss withholding tax on dividends must be deducted from the gross payment unless a notification procedure applies. If required under applicable law (including double tax treaties) in force at the time it is required to perform Restricted Obligations under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation, a Swiss Guarantor and the Company shall: (iv) use their best efforts to ensure that any payments under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation can be made without deduction of Swiss withholding tax on dividends or with deduction of Swiss withholding tax on dividends at a reduced rate, by discharging the liability to such tax by notification pursuant to applicable law (including tax treaties) rather than payment of the tax; (v) if and to the extent required by applicable law in force at the relevant time (including double taxation treaties), a Swiss Guarantor shall: A 65 ----- A. deduct the Swiss withholding tax on dividends at the rate of 35% (or such other rate as is in force at that time) from any payment under the notes indenture or any other notes documentation; B. pay the Swiss withholding tax on dividends to the tax authorities referred to in Article 34 of the Swiss Federal Law on Withholding Tax (Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13. _Oktober 1965) (the “Swiss Federal Tax Administration”); and_ C. notify and provide evidence to the Trustee that the Swiss withholding tax on dividends has been paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A Swiss Guarantor and the Company shall use their best efforts to ensure that any person which is, as a result of a deduction of Swiss withholding tax on dividends, entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss withholding tax on dividends, will, as soon as possible after the deduction of the Swiss withholding tax on dividends, (1) request a refund of the Swiss withholding tax on dividends under any applicable law (including double tax treaties) and (2) pay to the Trustee upon receipt any amount so refunded.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1287,NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1287.7,Seasonality,1287.7.1,,"Although the Group operates in a number of sporting goods segments during all four seasons, its business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the fourth quarter of a financial year has been the strongest quarter for the Group in terms of both net sales and profitability, primarily due to higher sales through the Company’s DTC channel compared to the rest of the year and a higher share of fall and winter collections in the Group’s Technical Apparel and Outdoor Performance segments. The Ball & Racquet Sports segment is generally more consistent across fiscal quarters. Working capital requirements typically increase throughout the second and third fiscal quarters as inventory builds to support the Group’s peak shipping and selling period which typically occurs from August to December. Cash provided by operating activities is typically highest in the first fiscal quarter due to the significant inflows associated with the peak selling season.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1287,NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1287.8,2.** **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation,1287.8.1,,"These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as at January 1, 2023. The interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended December 31, 2022. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in millions of U.S. dollars (USD). The presented figures and percentages are subject to rounding adjustments, which may cause discrepancies between the sum of the individual figures and the presented aggregated column and row totals. The figures have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period as well as derivative financial instruments at fair value. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of the business. Despite incurring operational losses, the Company maintains ongoing liquidity through a USD 336 million (EUR 315 million) revolving credit facility. This facility is designed to support the Company’s short-term liquidity requirements. Additionally, the Company has established several cash ----- pooling structures with the Group’s relationship banks as well as a factoring agreement with a banking institution that can be utilized in order to manage the liquidity of the Group. The Interim Financial Statements were authorized for issuance in accordance with a resolution of the Company’s Board of Directors on November 17, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The management’s assessment of the impact of new standards, which are not yet effective and which have not been early adopted by the Group, on the consolidated interim financial statements is on-going, but is not expected to have a material impact for the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460
306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1287,NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1287.10,"Significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions",1287.10.1,,"When preparing the unaudited condensed interim financial statements, the Group’s management makes judgments and estimates influencing the content of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements and it must exercise its judgment regarding the application of accounting policies. Management continuously evaluates the judgments and estimates it uses. The significant judgments made and the estimates used by management have been applied in the same manner as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. When preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s management makes judgments and estimates influencing the content of the consolidated financial statements and it must exercise its judgment regarding the application of accounting policies. The judgments and estimates are based on a set of underlying data that may include management’s historical experience, knowledge of current event and conditions, and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management continuously evaluates the judgments and estimates it uses. These estimates have been applied in a manner that is consistent with prior periods. There are no known trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that the Group believes will materially affect the methodology or assumptions used in making these judgments and estimates in the consolidated financial statements. The following are the accounting policies subject to judgments and estimates that the Group believes could have the most significant impact on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Any changes in the estimates and assumptions are recognized in the period in which the estimate or assumption is revised. _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The carrying amounts of non-current tangible and intangible assets are assessed by means of impairment tests whenever there is an indication of impairment. Any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are nevertheless assessed at least once a year. More details of the impairment are disclosed under note 9. _Provisions_ Provisions are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legal or actual obligation for the Company to settle an obligation arising as the consequence of a past event that is considered certain or likely to occur. The most important regular provisions are due to the repair or replacement of products during the warranty period. These provisions are determined on the basis of historical experience. The provisions recognized represent management’s best estimate of the present value of the future costs assumed to be incurred. The actual costs may differ from the estimated. More details on the provisions are disclosed in note 21. _Accounts receivable_ The Group has a significant number of customers which minimizes the concentration of credit risks. Ongoing estimates are done related to the ability to collect the Group’s accounts receivables and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the ability of the Group’s customers to make the required payments. The historical levels of credit losses are considered to make judgments about the creditworthiness of the customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. More details on the aging and valuation provisions of the accounts receivables are disclosed in note 28. _Inventories_ Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which requires an estimate of the products’ future selling prices. When assessing the net realizable value of the inventories, the Group ----- considers multiple factors and uses estimates related to fluctuations in inventory levels, aging of inventory, customer behavior and anticipated sales volume, seasonality, expected selling prices and selling costs. More details on the inventory provisions are disclosed in note 16. _Income taxes_ Management judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized. The Group is also subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. There may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group anticipates questions arising in tax audits and recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. More details on the income taxes are disclosed under note 12. _Pension plans_ The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (or income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions (see note 8). More details on the pension plans are disclosed under note 8. _Share-based payments_ Options granted will vest upon satisfaction of service and performance conditions, and an exit event (a public offering of the shares of the Company or a sale of the controlling majority of the shares in the Company or business assets) (the “exit event”), which is a non-market performance condition. For options with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures, and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is based on management’s best estimate of expected forfeitures, taking into consideration historical trends and expected future behavior. For options with a nonmarket performance condition (i.e. exit event), the Company recognizes the expense if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the exit event will be achieved. No share-based payment expense has been recognized in these consolidated financial statements since the likelihood of occurrence of such condition was not deemed to be probable during any reporting period. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the non-market performance condition at each reporting date. The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model including any market performance conditions and excluding the impact of any service and nonmarket performance vesting conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Hereinafter, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to as the “Group”or “Amer Sports”. The ultimate parent company of the Group is Amer Sports Holding (Cayman) Limited (the “parent company”). Amer Sports is a global platform of sport and outdoor brands, including Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson, Atomic and Peak Performance. Amer Sports manufactures, markets and sells sports equipment, apparel, and footwear through wholesale and direct to consumer channels globally and has a sales network in 34 countries, with North America, Europe, Asia and China being the main market areas. Amer Sports Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was founded in 1950. On April 1, 2019, Amer Sports Corporation was acquired by a consortium consisting of ANTA Sports Products Limited (a sportswear company in China, “ANTA Sports”), FountainVest Partners (private equity firm in Asia), Anamered Investments Inc. (an investment vehicle owned by Chip Wilson) and Tencent Holdings Limited (a technology company in Asia), each of which initially owned their interests in Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited, an indirect parent of Amer Sports Corporation following the acquisition, through Amer Sports Holding (Cayman) Limited (the “Acquisition”). In 2022, in preparation for a potential initial public offering, the Group undertook a reorganization pursuant to which Amer Sports Holding (Cayman) Limited exchanged its shares of Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited for new shares of Amer Sports Management Holding (Cayman) Limited, the new holding company parent of Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited. Amer Sports Holding (HK) Limited is the immediate parent of Amer Sports Holding 3 Oy, the predecessor entity of the Company (the “predecessor entity”).

The reorganization noted above was accounted for as a capital reorganization applying the predecessor accounting method. Under predecessor accounting, the Group carries forward the predecessor carrying values of the net assets and liabilities assumed as previously reflected in the financial statements of the predecessor entity and the comparative balances are presented on that basis except for restatements due to changes in accounting principles, classification and corrections of errors as disclosed below in note 3. The reorganization was applied fully retrospectively, so that the Company’s share capital and outstanding ordinary shares are retrospectively presented in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for the comparative periods as of December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020. The same basis of outstanding ordinary shares has been applied for the earnings per share calculation for the comparative periods. The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of U.S. dollars (USD). The presented figures and percentages are subject to rounding adjustments, which may cause discrepancies between the sum of the individual figures and the presented aggregated column and row totals. The figures have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period as well as derivative financial instruments at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies below. The consolidated financial statements ----- have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of the business.

COVID-19 pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) caused governments and public health officials to impose restrictions and recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus. In 2020, the Company took several temporary measures, including temporary layoffs, a travel and recruitment freeze, postponing certain projects and temporary store closings negatively influencing revenue. In 2022 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have any major negative impact on the Company’s operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s operations, and in turn, its operating results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. At the current time, management does not anticipate any long-term adverse effects, but continues to monitor any effects on inventories and other significant estimates. Russia-Ukraine conflict As a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed against Russia, the Group put all its shipments to Russia on hold on February 26, 2022 and suspended all significant commercial activities in Russia by the end of fiscal year 2022 indefinitely, including store, e-commerce channels, and shipments to the Company’s wholesale partners.

Assets or disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and disclosed as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of financial position. These assets are not amortized or depreciated. An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset or a disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset or a disposal group, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset or a disposal group is recognized at the date of derecognition. A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that has been disposed of or will be disposed of in accordance with a coordinated plan.

The Group companies record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate on the transaction date or at an estimated rate sufficiently close to the rate on the transaction date. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are outstanding at the end of the financial year are translated at the closing rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses related to operational transactions are presented within operating expenses above Operating profit. Exchange rate gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated loans and other receivables and liabilities connected with financing transactions are recorded at their net values as finance income and expenses. The consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss is translated into U.S. dollars by consolidating each calendar month separately using the actual daily average for the month, whereby the sum of the twelve calendar months represents the whole year.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1287,NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1287.27,Financial assets,1287.27.1,,"Categorization and measurement In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial assets are categorized as: I. financial assets at fair value through profit or loss II. financial assets measured at amortized cost III. financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and loss (OCI) The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset and the Group’s business model for managing them. All purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized on the settlement date. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives are classified at fair value through profit and loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. Assets in this category are classified as current assets, except for maturities over 12 months after the balance sheet date. The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and ----- - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired. Financial assets are included in current assets, except for maturities over 12 months after the balance sheet date. The Group’s financial assets at amortized cost include accounts receivables, other non-current financial assets and other non-interest yielding receivables. The Group measures financial assets at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding For financial assets at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognized in OCI. Financial assets at fair value through OCI are measured at their fair value by applying the market prices at the balance sheet date or some other determination of value used by the Company. The change in fair value is presented in fair value and other reserves under shareholders’ equity. Fair value changes are transferred from shareholders’ equity to the consolidated statement of loss when the asset is sold or its value has been impaired such that an impairment loss must be recognized. Financial assets at fair value through OCI whose fair value cannot be determined reliably are measured at cost or a lower value if they are impaired. Financial assets at fair value through OCI are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months after the balance sheet date. Derecognition A financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group substantially transferred all rewards and risks associated with the ownership. In the case of sales of trade receivables, essentially all rewards and risks are transferred to the buyer of the receivables. Impairment Loss allowances are recognized for expected credit losses (ECL) on a financial asset that is measured at amortized cost or at fair value through OCI. For trade receivables, the Group adopts the so-called simplified approach, which does not require the recognition of periodic changes in credit risk, but rather the accounting of an expected credit loss calculated over the entire life of the credit (lifetime ECL) according to the provision matrix approach. ECLs of accounts receivable are measured on a collective basis. The grouping is based on geographical region, customer rating, the type of collateral or whether the receivables are covered by trade credit insurance as well as the type of customer. The ECL model is forward-looking and the expected default rates are based on the realized losses in the past based on the previous three years considering the time value of money, probability-weighted outcome, supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The lifetime ECL allowances are calculated using the gross carrying amounts of the outstanding trade receivables and the expected default rates with probability-weighted outcomes. The historically observed default rates are updated annually. In addition, forward-looking specific provision is prepared in cases where the basic ECL allowance based on the historical loss data does not cover expected losses, which includes the impact of expected changes in the economic, regulatory and technological environment (such as industry outlook, GDP, employment, politics), and external market indicators. The estimates are based on ----- a systematic, on-going review and evaluation performed as part of the credit-risk evaluation process.

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially carried at fair value. Transaction costs are included in the original carrying amount of financial liabilities. All financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities, except for maturities over 12 months after the balance sheet date, in which case they are classified as long-term liabilities. Current financial liabilities include current interest-bearing liabilities, accounts payables and other current liabilities. Accounts payables correspond primarily to trade payables. They also include payables that have been transferred to a vendor financing program, as there is no material difference in the nature or terms of the liabilities compared to other trade payables.

Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are used to hedge against changes in the value of receivables and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, and interest rate swaps and interest rate options to hedge against interest rate risk. Crosscurrency swaps are used to hedge against changes in value of foreign currency denominated receivables and liabilities and against interest rate risk. Foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swaps and options and cross currency swaps are measured at fair value on the day that the Group becomes a party to the contract. Subsequent measurement is also at fair value. Foreign exchange derivatives are measured at fair value using the closing rates quoted by the European Central Bank on the reporting date together with common pricing models that are used for valuation of foreign exchange forward contracts and options. The fair values of interest rate and cross currency swaps are calculated as the current value of future cash flows. Interest rate options are valued with year-end interest rates together with common option pricing models. Gains and losses from fair value measurement are treated in accordance with the purpose of the derivative financial instrument. For maturities below 12 months after the balance sheet date, the fair value of the derivatives is presented in prepaid expenses and other receivables or other liabilities. For maturities over 12 months, the fair value is presented in other non-current assets or other liabilities. Changes in the value of derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as finance income and expenses, except for when they are associated with hedging the cash flow from operating activities, in which case they are recorded in other operating income and expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Any ineffective component, however, will be ----- immediately recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. The cumulative change in gains or losses for the effective hedges is transferred to the income statement for the period when the hedged item is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or if the hedge does not meet the requirements set for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, any cumulative gain or loss recorded in equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. When the forecasted cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recorded in other operating income and expenses in the case of an operating cash flow hedge. When initiating hedge accounting, the Group documents the correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instruments, as well as the Group’s risk management objective and hedge initiation strategy. The Group documents and evaluates the effectiveness of hedges when initiating hedging and on a quarterly basis by examining the degree to which the hedging instrument offsets changes in the fair value and cash flow of the hedged item.

Revenue is presented net of value added tax, discounts, incentives, rebates earned by customers, and estimated returns. Management applies the following five step model when determining the timing and amount of revenue recognition: 1. identifying the contracts with customers, 2. identifying the separate performance obligations, 3. determining the transaction price, 4. allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations, and 5. recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the products and services are transferred to the customer in accordance with the terms of delivery at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those products and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue recognized from services comprises mainly freight services in the Group’s operating segments. The revenue from the freight services is recognized at a point in time upon the delivery of the goods when the control has been transferred to the customer. The Group sells products and services through three channels: wholesale, own retail and ecommerce, with the latter two belonging to direct-to-consumer (DTC). In wholesale, volume rebates, performance bonuses and payment term discounts are offered to certain major customers. The Group typically applies the expected value method to estimate the variable consideration for the expected future rebates and performance bonuses. Certain contracts provide wholesale customers with a right to return goods within a specified period. The Group recognizes a refund liability as a reduction of revenue and a corresponding right of return asset as reduction of cost of goods sold based on the expected future return rates derived from historical data. ----- In own retail and ecommerce, revenue is recognized when control of the products is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon delivery to the customer or point of sale for sales in own retail stores. In ecommerce, the products sold online can be returned within 14−30 days of receipt of the products. For expected returns, the Group recognizes a refund liability as a reduction of revenue and a corresponding right of return asset as reduction of cost of goods sold based on the expected future return rates derived from historical data. A contract liability is recognized from the sale of gift cards in own retail and ecommerce. The Group expects to be entitled to a breakage amount. It recognizes breakage amount as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by customers based on historical data. The Group provides warranties that promise the customer that the delivered product is as typically specified in the contract and covers general repairs for defects that existed at the time of sale, as required by law. These assurance-type warranties are accounted for under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities _and Contingent Assets._ Revenue obtained from other companies is booked to license income when such companies manufacture or sell products bearing the Group’s trademarks. License income based on fixed license agreements is recognized evenly throughout the financial year, while license income determined by sales volumes is recognized during the financial year as the licensee generates sales revenue. The non-refundable minimum guarantees related to certain licensing agreements are for functional intellectual properties, while the guarantee revenue is recognized at the point in time the control of the license is transferred to the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Under defined contribution based plans, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and does not have any legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. Under defined contribution plans, the Group’s contributions are recorded as an expense in the period to which they relate. Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are partially or fully funded through payments to insurance companies or contributions to trustee-administered funds. In defined benefit plans, the pension expenses recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss are determined using the projected unit credit method, which calculates the present value of the obligation and the related service costs. The pension liability is measured by calculating the present value of future pension obligations, discounted using the market yield on high quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries where there is no deep market for such bonds. The defined benefit plan asset is measured at fair market value as of the reporting date. The net liability (asset) recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position is the present value of the pension obligation less the fair value of the plan assets. All actuarial gains and losses relating to post-employment benefits are recognized in full in other comprehensive income and loss. For other long-term employee benefits, the Group recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in the consolidated statement of loss.

Temporary differences arise from factors such as unused tax losses, depreciation differences, provisions, defined benefit pension plans, the fair valuation of derivative financial instruments, the internal inventory margin as well as measurements to fair value of assets in connection with business acquisitions. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized for unremitted earnings of subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations. These earnings, the amount of which cannot be practicably computed, could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or if the Company were to sell the shareholdings in the subsidiaries. A deferred tax asset is recognized as a result of unused tax losses and other temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that these can be utilized in future financial periods. For the assessment of probability, in addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the foreseeable future, appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into consideration.

Following the initial ----- recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The useful life of intangible assets is assessed as either finite or indefinite. _Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives_ Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise brand names and trademarks. As the brand names and trademarks are core to the business and as there is no foreseeable limit to the future cash flows generated by the intangible assets, brand names and trademarks are assessed as indefinitely lived. Brand names and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment at least on an annual basis (see impairment of assets below). Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of the asset to its carrying value. Any resulting impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. _Intangible assets with finite useful lives_ Intangible assets with a finite useful life consist of patents and software licenses, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 3 to 15 years. Patents and software licenses are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment and if any impairment indication exists, the asset is then tested for impairment. Development expenses are capitalized when they meet the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible _Assets and amortized during their useful lives._ The Group capitalizes development costs as intangible assets only when the following criteria are met: - the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset exists, - there is an intent to complete and an ability to use or sell the intangible asset, - the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits, - there are adequate resources available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset, and - there is the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. _Goodwill_ Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets measured at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at historical cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is not amortized. Goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) and are tested for impairment annually and if there are triggering events by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU to its carrying value.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1287,NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,1287.41,Leases,1287.41.1,,"At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease contracts under IFRS 16 Leases consist mainly of real estate (e.g. retail stores, offices, warehouses) and cars, where the Group acts as a lessee. The Group has elected to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which the lease term is shorter than 12 months and on lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of lowvalue (e.g. laptops, mobile phones; below USD 5 thousand). The lease expenses for short-term and lowvalue contracts as well as for lease contracts with variable leases based on net sales of the leased premises are recognized as rent expenses over the lease term in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. _Lease liabilities_ The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the incremental borrowing rate is applied. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and the type of the leased asset. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the fixed payments (including the in-substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The Group applies judgment in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise or not to exercise the option to extend or terminate the lease. It considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the extension or termination. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. A corresponding adjustment is done to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or it is recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. _Right-of-use assets_ The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying assets or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. ----- The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as for the property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by potential impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. In 2022 and 2021, the Group applied the amendments to IFRS 16 Leases as an optional practical expedient to allow lessees not to account for rent concessions as lease modifications if they are a direct consequence of COVID-19 and meet certain conditions. The practical expedient applies only if the revised consideration is substantially the same or less than the original consideration, the reduction in lease payments relates to payments due on or before June 30, 2022, and no other substantive changes have been made to the terms of the lease. All those rent concessions that met the aforementioned conditions were recognized as variable lease payment reductions in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

A cash generating unit determined for the impairment testing purposes is the smallest group of assets generating cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use (“VIU”). VIU has been calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each CGU (refer to note 9 for further details). An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

By presenting a more concise and focused view of its primary statements, Management aims ----- to provide a clearer picture of its net assets, financial position and results of operations and facilitate meaningful analysis of its consolidated financial statements. The reclassifications and adjustments made included the Company’s election to change the reporting currency in which the consolidated financial statements are presented from the Euro to the U.S. Dollar. The following summarizes the reclassifications and adjustments made and presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. - Reporting Currency: The Company elected to change the reporting currency in which the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented from the Euro to the U.S. Dollar. - License income: Historically, License income was presented as a separate line item on the face of the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified License income to combine License income with the line-item Revenue. - Research and development expenses: Historically, Research and development expenses were presented as a separate line item on the face of the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified Research and development expenses to combined Research and development expenses with the line item Administrative and other expenses. - Impairment losses: Historically, impairment losses on goodwill were presented within the line item Administrative and other expenses and impairment of trade receivables were presented within the line item Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified impairment losses from the above-mentioned line items into a separate line-item Impairment losses on the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. - Right-of-use assets: Historically, the Company presented right-of-use assets relating to land, buildings and constructions and machinery and equipment as individual line items on the consolidated statement of financial position. For all periods presented, the Company reclassified these line items and combined them into one line item Right-of-use assets. - The Company elected to change the format of the presentation of its consolidated statement of cash flows by changing that the reconciliation for operating cash flows begins with net loss instead of Earnings before taxes. Furthermore, the Company elected to break out and present several items as separate line items in the operating and financing cash flow section. - The Company elected to change the format of the presentation of its consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity by combining the categories Fair value and other reserves and Other OCI items into the category Cash flow hedge reserve given that the positions solely relate to effects of the changes in measurement of the Company’s currency cash flow hedges and related tax effects. The respective disclosures in the notes to these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted accordingly. Correction of errors In addition, the Company identified several corrections of errors, that were concluded material to the previously published predecessor consolidated financial statements of Amer Sports Holding 3 Oy. In accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the presented errors have been corrected retrospectively by restating every affected financial line item for all periods presented. The following table summarizes the impacts of these corrections of errors on the Group’s consolidated financial statements adjusted for changes resulting from accounting principles and classification. (a) The Company granted options to key employees under its share-based incentive plan that vest upon satisfaction of service and performance conditions, as well as an exit event. The exit event, which is a non-market performance condition, is defined as a public offering of the shares of the Company or a sale of the controlling majority of the shares in the Company or business assets, together with the exit event. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Company recognizes expense relating to options with a non-market performance condition, if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the exit event will be achieved. The assessment when ----- an initial public offering is probable involves judgment and careful consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances including the assessment of factors that are outside of the Company’s discretion. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that as of the reporting dates presented in the consolidated financial statements, a successful initial public offering was not yet deemed probable. Accordingly, the effects of the reversal of share-based compensation expense recognized in the amount of USD 8.9 million and USD 12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The related tax effect of increased income tax expenses and deferred tax liabilities amounted to USD 2.1 million and USD 3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. (b) In 2018 the Company announced a strategic review of its cycling business, consisting of the Mavic and Enve assets. During the fiscal year 2019, the Company classified the Mavic business as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and _Discontinued Operations. In June 2019, the Company sold the Mavic business to a third party._ Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that the transitional services provided to Mavic business should not have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss. Accordingly, the impairment loss on trade receivables between Amer Sports and Mavic S.A.S. in the amount of USD 8.2 million recorded in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was reclassified to continued operations at December 31, 2020. (c) The Company continued to depreciate and amortize the disposal groups’ non-current assets related to Precor and Suunto, which were classified as held for sale. In accordance with IFRS 5 Non_current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations an entity shall not depreciate or amortize a non-current asset while it is classified as part of a disposal group that is classified as held for sale. Accordingly, the effects of the reversal of recognition of depreciation and amortization expense in the amount of USD 1.0 million and USD 2.7 million in relation to Suunto for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were corrected in the consolidated financial statements. The accumulated reversal effect in December 31, 2022 did not affect net results of discontinued operations as the reduced amortization and depreciation expense recognized in 2021 and 2022 was offset by an increased loss upon disposal recognized in 2022. Additionally, the effect of the reversal of recognition of amortization and depreciation expense in the amount of USD 5.1 million in relation to Precor for the year ended December 31, 2021 was corrected in the consolidated financial statements. The reversal effect relating to Precor did not affect the net results of discontinued operations as the reduced amortization and depreciation expense recognized was offset by a decreased gain upon disposal. Furthermore, in the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022, the Company continued to classify certain assets and liabilities relating to continuing activities with Suunto as assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that these items should not be classified as assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. Accordingly, the effects of reclassing USD 10.5 million from assets held for sale to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, other non-current assets, accounts receivable, net and inventories in the amount of USD 2.2 million, USD 1.1 million, USD 0.1 million, USD 0.5 million, USD 6.4 million and USD 0.2 million, respectively, were corrected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the effects of reclassing USD 3.8 million from liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale to accounts payable and other liabilities in the amount of USD 0.6 million, USD 3.2 million, respectively, were also corrected in the consolidated financial statements. (d) As of December 31, 2022, the Company identified an understatement of USD 11.5 million in its inventory and other liabilities balances related to items in transit for which the Company retained ownership upon point of shipment. The effects of recognizing the inventory in transit on the consolidated statement of financial position are corrected in the consolidated financial statements. ----- (e) During fiscal year 2022, the Company acquired an interest in Dongguan Liesheng Electronic Technology Co. Ltd (“Liesheng”) accounted for as a non-current financial asset and recognized at fair value through OCI. As prescribed in the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, including available market data, the Company concluded that as of December 31, 2022, a decrease in the fair value of the financial asset in the amount of USD 10.9 million was required. The effects of recognizing this change in fair value recorded through OCI on the carrying amount of the investment is corrected in the consolidated financial statements. (f) The Group had open accounts receivable balances in Argentina related to a single distributor, which was not able to pay its outstanding invoice amounts due to abroad payment restrictions by the Central Bank of Argentina. Pursuant to an agreement reached, the negotiated part of the accounts receivables were converted to a loan with a specific payment plan. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that the converted receivable balances were noncurrent in nature and improperly classified in current assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified a net amount of USD 15.2 million to other non-current assets, comprising of USD 21.4 million from prepaid expenses and other receivables, which has partly been offset by a reclass of USD 6.2 million from accounts receivables. As of December 31, 2021, the Company reclassified USD 5.2 million from prepaid expenses and other receivables to other noncurrent assets. (g) During fiscal year 2022, the Group recorded an impairment loss in the amount of USD 40.2 million on goodwill attributed to Peak Performance. The estimation of an impairment loss requires a significant amount of judgement and use of estimates and assumptions such as forecasted cash flows, estimation of discount rates and future growth rates. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the impairment loss to be recognized allocated to Peak Performance should be increased by USD 160.0 million. The effects of recognizing this additional impairment loss, which is allocated to goodwill and trademarks in the amount of USD 140.9 million and USD 19.1 million, respectively, were corrected in the consolidated financial statements. The adjustment entailed a decrease in income tax expenses and deferred tax liabilities amounting to USD 4.8 million as well as a correction of the translation differences amounting to USD 1.1 million. (h) Historically, the Company presented tax liabilities related to certain tax risks in the line-item current tax liabilities. Upon reassessing the facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that the balances were non-current in nature and improperly classified in current liabilities. Therefore, such tax liabilities amounting to USD 20.8 million, USD 21.3 million and USD 21.6 million as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively, were reclassified to long-term tax liabilities. (i) The Company corrected rebate accruals in accounts receivable, net. Accordingly, the Company adjusted revenue by the amount of USD -2.6 million, USD -1.5 million and USD 0.8 million, cost of goods sold by the amount of USD -1.5 million, USD nil and USD nil as well as income tax expense by the amount of USD -0.3 million, USD -0.4 million and USD 0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Furthermore, the Company adjusted inventories in the amount of USD 1.5 million, USD nil and USD nil, accounts receivable, net by the amount of USD 4.1 million, USD 6.6 million and USD 8.1 million, current tax liabilities by the amount USD 1.4 million, USD 1.7 million and USD 2.0 million as well as accumulated deficit and other by the amount of USD 4.2 million, USD 5.0 million and USD 6.1 million as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively. The respective disclosures in the notes to these consolidated financial statements have been corrected accordingly.

Carrying amounts of loans from financial institutions, loans from related parties, and other interest-bearing liabilities approximate their fair values because the loans are at floating rate. Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The Group does not have any financial instrument included in level 1. Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. over-thecounter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities. Carrying amounts of current financial instruments carried at amortized cost are reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short-term nature. The Group’s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements during the reporting period. The valuation process and valuation techniques, which are stated in the most recent consolidated annual financial statements, are applicable in the reporting period. ----- Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: - for interest rate swaps—the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves - for foreign currency forwards—the present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange rates at the consolidated statement of financial position, and - for other financial instruments—discounted cash flow analysis. All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2, except for unlisted equity securities, promissory notes and available for sale factoring receivables, where the fair values have been determined based on present values and the discount rates used were adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk. In cases where credit risk of counterparty is low and maturity is short-term, the carrying amount of such instrument approximates its fair value. The following table shows the valuation technique used in measuring level 3 fair values for financial instruments in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

During June 2021, the Company entered into a term sheet with Dongguan Liesheng Electronic Technology Co.

On December 28, 2021, an agreement was reached with Liesheng to acquire the Suunto business subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The closing of the transaction was completed on May 6, 2022. The consolidated cash and debt-free sales value amounted to USD 18.3 million (net of transaction costs). The loss on disposal upon the sale of the Suunto business amounted to USD 5.5 million and was reported under loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. Upon classifying Suunto as held-for-sale in 2021, an impairment loss in the amount of USD 77.5 million was recognized in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1297,19.** **LOSS PER SHARE,1297.8,Valuation of goodwill and trademarks for the Peak Performance and Winter Sports Equipment cash generating units,1297.8.1,,"As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) are tested for impairment when management has identified indications of impairment or at least once a year. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive income and loss when the carrying amount of the CGU is greater than the recoverable amount. The recoverable ----- amounts of all CGUs were determined by the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use (VIU). VIU has been calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each CGU. The Group recorded goodwill and trademarks of USD 149.0 million and USD 270.9 million, respectively, for the Winter Sports Equipment CGU as of December 31, 2022. The Group recorded trademarks of USD 151.6 million for the Peak Performance CGU as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of USD 179.0 million and on trademarks of USD 19.1 million for the Peak Performance CGU. We identified the evaluation of the impairment assessment of goodwill and trademarks of the Peak Performance and Winter Sports Equipment CGUs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgement was required to evaluate management’s significant assumptions included in the projected discounted cash flows used in the determination of the recoverable amount of the CGUs, specifically the revenue growth rate and discount rate assumptions. Additionally, the audit effort associated with this estimate required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis over the revenue growth rate and discount rate assumptions to assess the impact that changes to these assumptions would have had on the recoverable amount of the Winter Sports Equipment and Performance Peak CGUs. We compared the Group’s historical revenue forecasts for such CGUs to actual results to assess management’s ability to accurately forecast. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: - evaluating the discount rate assumptions by testing the source information underlying management’s determination of the discount rates and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. - evaluating market transactions and comparable company revenue growth rates to develop a range of independent market participants’ growth rates and comparing to those selected by management.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

As permitted by IFRS 8 Operating segments, the Company assessed, based on the qualitative aggregation criteria mentioned in IFRS 8.12 and on a quantitative analysis based on gross margins, if Salomon and Winter Sports Equipment are similar and could be aggregated to one reportable segment. The following aggregation criteria were analyzed by the Company: Nature of the products and services, nature of the production processes, type or class of customer for the products and services and methods used to distribute the products or provide the service. Based on the Company’s assessment, the Company concluded that the operating segments Salomon and Winter Sports Equipment are similar and can be aggregated into the reportable segment Outdoor Performance. Therefore, the Company identified three reportable segments: Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance as well as Ball & Racquet Sports. The Company measures each operating segment’s performance based on revenue and adjusted operating profit as these are the measures used by the CODM for assessing the performance of operating segments. Each of the segments includes different brands and comprises a range of products. Technical Apparel Technical Apparel includes outdoor apparel, footwear and accessories and consists of the Arc’teryx and Peak Performance brands. Outdoor Performance Outdoor Performance includes outdoor apparel, footwear, accessories and winter sports equipment and consists of our Salomon, Atomic, Armada and ENVE brands. While the operating segments Salomon and Winter Sports Equipment are separately managed and reported, the operating segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar products, production processes, type of customers, methods used to distribute as well as average gross margins and similar expected growth rates. Ball & Racquet Sports Ball & Racquet Sports includes sports equipment, apparel and accessories and consists of our Wilson, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield, Atec and Luxilon brands, all of which comprise the Wilson Sporting Goods portfolio. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Through its defined pension plans the Company is exposed to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and mortality risk. The main risk is that additional contributions are required if investment returns are not sufficient to pay for the benefits. The level of equity returns is a key determinant of overall investment return. The investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical to asset classes held. A decrease in discount rates, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase in plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the position in the consolidated statement of financial position and may give rise to increased cost in the consolidated statement of loss. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation. The estimated contributions to the pension plans are USD 8.6 million during 2023. The weighted average of the duration of the defined benefit obligations was 9.5 years in 2022, 11.7 years in 2021 and 13.1 years in 2020 (continuing operations).

306,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1302,8.** **PENSIONS,1302.15,Impairment losses by asset type,1302.15.1,,"An impairment on goodwill amounting to USD 179.0 million and on trademarks amounting to USD 19.1 million was recognized for Peak Performance in 2022. The recoverable amount for Peak Performance as of December 31, 2022 is USD 197.2 million and is based on value-in- use calculations. In 2020 or 2021, no impairment losses on goodwill and trademarks were recorded in the continuing operations. Impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as trademarks, are performed when the management has identified indications of impairment or once a year when business plans for the next strategic planning horizon are approved by the management. The Group management uses assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions, such as economic growth, expected inflation rates, expected market share, revenue and margin developments. Goodwill is monitored by management at Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) level, the level at which it and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment. The CGUs in the Group for continuing operations are the following: Winter Sports Equipment, Salomon Apparel and Footwear, Arc’teryx, Ball & Racquet Sports and Peak Performance. Discontinued operations are discussed in note 29. The impairment tests were calculated during the fourth quarter of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined by the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use (“VIU”). VIU has been calculated using the discounted cash flow method for each CGU. The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the relevant industries and have been based on historical data from external and internal sources. The key assumptions used in the estimation of the value in use are set out below. The VIU of all CGUs were determined by cash flow projections based on a 10-year financial forecast, of which the first 5-years were prepared by management and approved by the board. To better reflect the medium-term growth expectations for the CGU in growing markets, financial forecast after first 5-year period are extrapolated for a further 5-years using declining growth rates which reduces the year five growth rate down to the long-term growth rate as shown below.

The 2019 ESOP provides for awards in the form of stock options to the Group’s key employees, and it is an equity-settled arrangement, except for stock options granted to certain employees which allow them to elect for shares or cash settlement. The maximum number of options that may be granted is 3% of all of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares. Subject to a participant’s continued employment, options granted under the 2019 ESOP will vest upon satisfaction of vesting conditions set out in an award agreement and an exit event (a public offering of the shares of the Company or a sale of a controlling majority of the shares in the Company or business assets) (the “exit event”). In addition to an exit event, 35% of the options granted are time-vested, which vest evenly on an annual basis over a 5-year period, 65% of the options granted are with Group and/or brand performances.

The average tax rate is a quotient from the Group’s loss and tax expense. In 2022, it was negative mainly because of an impairment charge for book purposes for which no deferred taxes could be recorded. It changed in 2020 and 2021 from the prior year, respectively, because of changes in the mix of profits and losses included in its computation.

These reviews require management to estimate future demand for products. If the future demand for Group’s products was weaker than anticipated or the market conditions deteriorated, the value of inventories would likely have to be written down. In 2022 management conducted an intensive review of our estimate of net realizable value of the inventories in response to an adjustment of the distribution strategy. With more focus on the self-operated distribution channels, the Group is able to dispose the out-of-season products more efficiently. Based on extensive investigation, management revised the estimate correspondingly. This change in estimate resulted in a reduction in the inventory provision by approximately USD 10.9 million recorded in cost of goods sold.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Carrying amounts of loans from financial institutions, loans from related parties, and other interest-bearing liabilities approximate their fair values because the loans are at floating rate. Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The Group does not have any financial instrument included in level 1. Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. over-thecounter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities. The Group’s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements during the fiscal years. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: - for interest rate swaps—the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves - for foreign currency forwards—the present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange rates at the consolidated statement of financial position, and - for other financial instruments—discounted cash flow analysis. ----- All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2, except for unlisted equity securities, promissory notes and available for sale factoring receivables, where the fair values have been determined based on present values and the discount rates used were adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk. In cases where credit risk of counterparty is low and maturity is short-term, the carrying amount of such instrument approximates its fair value. The following table show the valuation technique used in measuring level 3 fair values for financial instruments in the consolidated statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

In practice, the hedge ratios are higher for closer months than for later months. The hedge ratio is maintained between 55% and 95% of 24 months cash flow, except in currencies with high interest rate where the hedge horizon is 12–18 months. Hedge ratios are monitored daily. The hedged cash flow is expected to be realized during the following 12–24 months. Amer Sports hedges only annual cash flows or other exposures with a value of over EUR 5.0 million. Amer Sports temporarily shortened the hedging horizon to 12 months and in 2022 has managed to reach longer tenors again, but not yet in the extent of the Treasury Policy. Amer Sports applies hedge accounting to the forecasted sales or purchases in foreign currencies related to its operating activities for cash flows with a counter value of over EUR 10 million per currency pair in the entity. The effectiveness is assessed quarterly by analysing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. The forecasted hedged transactions are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedging instrument, and therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transactions have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective. Sources of ineffectiveness, including timing differences in the settlement of forecasted hedged transactions and hedging instruments, and changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments, are not considered material. Foreign exchange differences of foreign exchange derivatives are recognized as hedging reserve while interest rate differentials related to the foreign exchange derivatives are recorded through the consolidated statement of loss. According to its Treasury Policy, Amer Sports may hedge 0 to 50% of subsidiaries’ equity. At the end of 2022, 2021 and 2020 there were no outstanding equity hedges or net investment hedges.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

Translation risk relates to the foreign currency denominated earnings when they are translated into USD. Amer Sports has operations in most of the major currency areas, and its sales are diversified in multiple currencies. On the business unit level, transaction risk arises when the unit sells in its home currency but the cost base is in foreign currencies or sells or buys goods in foreign currencies. Amer Sports’ risk management is aiming to eliminate material uncertainties relating to foreign exchange rates. At the end of the year, Amer Sports’ currency position consisted of intercompany and external interestfree and interest-bearing foreign currency denominated receivables and liabilities and foreign exchange derivatives. Foreign exchange derivatives include both balance sheet and cash flow hedges. Balance sheet risks have been managed by financing Amer Sports’ subsidiaries in their functional currencies. The risks have been concentrated on the centralized distribution and purchasing units that invoice the subsidiaries in their respective functional currencies.

The effective interest rate is calculated by taking into account interest expenses, financing expenses and derivatives’ expenses. The average interest rate of the Group’s interest-bearing debt was 4.0% in 2022, 3.6% in 2021 and 3.7% in 2020. The Group has outstanding non-hedge accounting related interest rate derivatives. The derivates used to hedge floating rate loans that have been repaid. Although the original loans were repaid, it was decided to maintain these derivatives as a protection against interest rate risks related to the new funding. The expected impact from interest rate benchmark reform concerning IBOR reference rates replacement is considered to be limited for Amer Sports, since the majority of the Group’s external contracts are tied to EURIBOR reference rates. Amer Sports’ IBOR exposure is mainly related to USD LIBOR linked external short term loans and funding that amounted to USD 155 million as of December 31, 2022 and have yet to transition to an alternative benchmark rate. USD LIBOR publication will be ceased after June 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,460

The risk arises from the repricing of floating rate debt and with the raising of new floating rate debt. A fixed rate debt is subject to “fair value risk”. The purpose of interest rate risk management is to bring predictability for interest expenses. Amer Sports Treasury may hedge the outstanding or forthcoming interest rate position of Amer Sports Group by using interest rate derivatives defined in the Treasury Policy. The duration of the loans in Amer Sports, Inc. was 1 month in 2022, 3 months in 2021 and 4 months in 2020. 2% of the debt portfolio was at fixed rate as of December, 2022, 2% in 2021 and 2% in 2020. Cash and cash equivalents are excluded from the interest rate risk portfolio of the group due to their short-term nature. The sensitivity of the consolidated statement of loss contains changes in interest expenses for the next 12 months due to an increase/decrease of 1% in market interest rates, provided that other factors remain unchanged. The below table illustrates the sensitivity of the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity and the consolidated statement of loss to an increase of 1% in interest rates, provided that other factors remain unchanged.

Information on accounts receivable identified for factoring are provided and verified by the Factor prior to being accepted for factoring. The Group is charged a fee of commission of 0.4% on the basis of purchased gross invoice amount, and an adjustment rate of the Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.50% per annum, based on the number of days between the purchase date and the settlement date. The program is in place for certain approved US based obligors. Amer Sports uses sale of receivables with the purpose to balance liquidity swings of the Group. The year-end value of uncollected receivables transferred as part of the factoring program was USD 34.6 million as of December 31, 2022, USD 0 million as of December 31, 2021 and USD 0.1 million as of January 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, the total accounts receivable balances transferred to the Factor amounted to USD 116.2 million, USD 0 million and USD 117.2 million, respectively. The Group has assessed that significantly all risks and rewards of the transferred accounts receivables have been transferred to the Factor. The Group only retains the risk of late payments of the underlying debtors, which has been considered immaterial for the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of the continuing involvement in the transferred trade receivables amounted to USD 0.5 million as of December 31, 2022, which corresponds to the maximum payment and the undiscounted cash outflows the Group might have to pay in case of late payment.
